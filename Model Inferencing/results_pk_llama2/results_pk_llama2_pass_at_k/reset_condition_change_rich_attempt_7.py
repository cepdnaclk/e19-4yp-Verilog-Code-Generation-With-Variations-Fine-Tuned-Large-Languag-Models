To perform a transformation to change the reset condition from active-high to active-low or vice versa, we can use the `xform` framework in Python. Here is an example of how to implement this transformation:
```python
import pyverilog
from pyverilog import ast as pya_ast
from re import sub
from argparse import ArgumentParser

class ResetVisitor(pya_ast.Visitor):
    def __init__(self, signal_name):
        self.signal_name = signal_name
        self.changes_made = []
        self.signal_found = False

    def visit(self, node):
        if isinstance(node, pya_ast.Decl):
            # Check for target declarations
            if isinstance(node, pya_ast.IfStmt) and "rst" in node.args:
                self.signal_found = True
                self.changes_made.append(f"Found {self.signal_name}")

                # Update sensitivity lists (posedge to negedge)
                for posedge in node.sensitive:
                    if posedge.name == self.signal_name:
                        posedge.negedge = True

                for negedge in node.sensitive:
                    if negedge.name == self.signal_name:
                        negedge.posedge = True

            # Visit children
            for c in node.children():
                self.visit(c)

def transform(input_file, output_file, signal_name):
    # Parse AST
    ast = parse([input_file])

    # Apply visitor
    visitor = ResetVisitor(signal_name)
    visitor.visit(ast)

    # Perform text transformations
    with open(input_file, "r") as f:
        content = f.read()
    modified_content = sub(pattern, replacement, content)

    # Write output
    with open(output_file, "w") as f:
        f.write(modified_content)

    return True

def main():
    parser = ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument("-i", "--input", required=True, help="Input file")
    parser.add_argument("-o", "--output", required=True, help="Output file")
    parser.add_argument("-s", "--signal", required=True, help="Signal name to change reset condition")
    args = parser.parse_args()

    transform(args.input, args.output, args.signal)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. `import pyverilog`: This line imports the `pyverilog` module, which provides an AST parser for Verilog and SystemVerilog files.
2. `from pyverilog import ast as pya_ast`: This line imports the `pya_ast` module, which is a custom AST representation that we'll use to perform transformations on the input file.
3. `from re import sub`: This line imports the `sub` function from the `re` module, which we'll use for text transformations.
4. `from argparse import ArgumentParser`: This line imports the `ArgumentParser` class from the `argparse` module, which we'll use to create a command-line interface for the transformation.
5. `class ResetVisitor(pya_ast.Visitor):`: This line defines a new class called `ResetVisitor`, which inherits from the `pya_ast.Visitor` class. This class will contain the logic for identifying and transforming the reset signal in the input file.
6. `def __init__(self, signal_name):`: This line defines an initializer method for the `ResetVisitor` class. It takes a single argument, `signal_name`, which is the name of the reset signal we want to change.
7. `self.signal_name = signal_name`: This line assigns the `signal_name` argument to the `signal_name` attribute of the `ResetVisitor` class.
8. `self.changes_made = []: This line defines an empty list called `changes_made`, which will store the results of the transformation (e.g., "Found signal X").
9. `self.signal_found = False`: This line defines a variable called `signal_found` to keep track of whether we've found the reset signal in the input file.
10. `def visit(self, node):`: This line defines a method called `visit`, which is the main method for performing the transformation on the input AST. It takes a single argument, `node`, which is the current node being traversed in the AST.
11. `if isinstance(node, pya_ast.Decl):`: This line checks if the `node` argument is an instance of the `pya_ast.Decl` class. If it is, we know that we're dealing with a declaration, which could contain a reset signal.
12. `if isinstance(node, pya_ast.IfStmt) and "rst" in node.args:`: This line checks if the `node` argument is an instance of the `pya_ast.IfStmt` class (i.e., a conditional statement), and if the `rst` keyword is present in the arguments to the `if` statement. If both conditions are true, we know that we need to perform the transformation.
13. `self.signal_found = True`: This line sets the `signal_found` attribute to `True`, indicating that we've found the reset signal in the input file.
14. `self.changes_made.append(f"Found {self.signal_name}")` : This line adds a message to the `changes_made` list, indicating that we've found the reset signal. The message is formatted using a string formatting operation (`f"Found {self.signal_name}"`).
15. `sub(pattern, replacement, content)`: This line uses the `sub` function from the `re` module to perform a text transformation on the input file. The `pattern` argument is the regular expression pattern to match, and the `replacement` argument is the replacement text. The `content` argument is the contents of the input file.
16. `with open(input_file, "r") as f:`: This line opens the input file in read mode using the `open` function.
17. `modified_content = f.read()`: This line reads the entire contents of the input file into a string using the `f.read()` method.
18. `with open(output_file, "w") as f:`: This line opens the output file in write mode using the `open` function.
19. `f.write(modified_content)`: This line writes the transformed contents of the input file to the output file using the `f.write()` method.
20. `return True/False`: This line returns a boolean value indicating whether the transformation was successful (True) or not (False).

The `transform` function takes in three arguments: the input file, the output file, and the signal name to change the reset condition. It applies the transformation by calling the `visit` method on the `ResetVisitor` instance, then performs text transformations on the input file using the `sub` function from the `re` module. Finally, it writes the transformed contents of the input file to the output file using the `open` function.

The `main` function creates a `ArgumentParser` instance and defines command-line arguments for the input file, output file, and signal name to change the reset condition. It then calls the `transform` function with these arguments to perform the transformation.

When you run the script, it will prompt you to enter the input file, output file, and signal name to change the reset condition. It will then transform the input file and write the transformed contents to the output file.
