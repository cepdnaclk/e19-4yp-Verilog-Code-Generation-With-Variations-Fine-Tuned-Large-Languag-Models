Here is an example of a transformation module for the xform framework that renames signals in a Verilog module:
```python
import pyverilog
from pyverilog.parse import parse
from pyverilog.ast import Node, Decl, Assignment
from re import sub
from argparse import ArgumentParser

class SignalRenameVisitor(pyverilog.xform.Visitor):
    """
    Rename signals in a Verilog module.
    """
    def __init__(self, old_name, new_name):
        self.old_name = old_name
        self.new_name = new_name
        self.changes_made = []

    def visit(self, node):
        if isinstance(node, Decl):
            for item in node.list:
                if hasattr(item, "name") and item.name == self.old_name:
                    item.name = self.new_name
                    self.changes_made.append(f"Renamed {self.old_name} to {self.new_name}")
        elif isinstance(node, Assignment):
            for target in node.list:
                if hasattr(target, "name") and target.name == self.old_name:
                    target.name = self.new_name
                    self.changes_made.append(f"Renamed {self.old_name} to {self.new_name}")
        elif isinstance(node, Node):
            for c in node.children():
                self.visit(c)

def transform(input_file, output_file, old_name, new_name):
    """
    Transform the given Verilog module by renaming the signal.
    """
    # Parse AST
    ast, directives = parse([input_file])

    # Apply visitor
    visitor = SignalRenameVisitor(old_name, new_name)
    visitor.visit(ast)

    # Perform regex transformations
    with open(input_file, "r") as f:
        content = f.read()

    # Apply changes...
    modified_content = sub(old_name, new_name, content)

    # Write output
    with open(output_file, "w") as f:
        f.write(modified_content)

    return True
```
Here is an explanation of the code:

1. The `SignalRenameVisitor` class inherits from the `pyverilog.xform.Visitor` class and has a few additional attributes: `old_name`, `new_name`, and `changes_made`. These are used to keep track of the signal being renamed and the changes made during the transformation process.
2. The `visit()` method is called for each node in the AST. If the node is a `Decl`, the `SignalRenameVisitor` class checks if the signal name matches the `old_name`. If it does, it renames the signal by setting its `name` attribute to `new_name`. The changes made are added to the `changes_made` list.
3. If the node is an `Assignment`, the `SignalRenameVisitor` class checks if the target of the assignment matches the `old_name`. If it does, it renames the target by setting its `name` attribute to `new_name`. The changes made are added to the `changes_made` list.
4. If the node is a `Node`, the `SignalRenameVisitor` class calls itself recursively on each child node.
5. The `transform()` function parses the AST, applies the `SignalRenameVisitor`, and performs the actual text transformations by replacing occurrences of the old signal name with the new signal name using regular expressions.
6. Finally, the modified content is written to the output file.

To use this transformation module, you can run the following command:
```bash
python transform.py --old_name old_signal --new_name new_signal input.verilog output.verilog
```
This will rename all occurrences of `old_signal` in `input.verilog` to `new_signal` in `output.veriger`.
