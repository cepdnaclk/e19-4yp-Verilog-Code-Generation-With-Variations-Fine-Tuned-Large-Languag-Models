Transformer.py
================

This module defines a transformation for changing a signal's bit width specification in Verilog/SystemVerilog files using the xform framework. The transformation works by first parsing the AST using PyVerilog, identifying the target elements (signals) with existing width specifications, and then replacing them with new width specifications using regular expressions.

Important! This transformation does not modify the signal name or other attributes. It only changes the bit width specification.

**Module Structure:**

* `transformer.py`: Main Python file containing the transformation module.
* `visitor.py`: Sub-module containing the visitor class that identifies target elements and performs text transformations using regular expressions.
* `parse.py`: Sub-module containing the PyVerilog parser function used to analyze the AST.

**Imports:**

* `pyverilog` for parsing the Verilog/SystemVerilog files.
* `re` for performing regular expression text transformations.
* `argparse` for creating a command-line interface.

**Functions:**

* `transform_file()`: The main transformation function that takes in the input file path, output file path, and signal name to be changed. It first parses the AST using PyVerilog, then applies the visitor class to identify target elements, and finally performs text transformations using regular expressions.
* `visit()`: The visitor class function that identifies target elements (signals) with existing width specifications in the AST and replaces them with new width specifications.

**Classes:**

* `ExampleVisitor`: The visitor class that inherits from the `xform.Pattern` class and performs text transformations using regular expressions.

**Docstrings:**

* Comprehensive docstrings are provided for each function and class, explaining their purpose, parameters, return types, and examples of usage.

**Usage:**

To use the transformation module, run the following command from the terminal:
```bash
$ python transformer.py --input_file input.v --output_file output.v --signal_name signal_to_change 4
```
This will apply the transformation to the `input.v` file and produce an updated `output.v` file with the specified signal's bit width specification changed to 4.

**Error Handling:**

The transformation module includes proper error handling mechanisms to handle cases where the input file cannot be parsed or the signal name is not found in the AST. Error messages are displayed to the user, and the transformation function returns `False` in such cases.
