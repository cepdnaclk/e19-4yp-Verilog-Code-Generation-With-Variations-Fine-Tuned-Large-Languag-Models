Here is an example of a transformation module for the xform framework that performs the task of changing the bit width of multiple signals at once:

This code defines a `BitWidthTransformationVisitor` class that inherits from the existing `TransformVisitor` class in the xform framework. The `visit_Signal`, `visit_Array`, and `visit_Struct` methods are defined to handle packed and unpacked arrays, as well as structs with signals to transform.

The `main` function takes a list of signal names and the new bit width as input, and uses the `BitWidthTransformationVisitor` class to perform the transformation.

The code also includes a command-line interface using the `ArgumentParser` module, which allows users to pass in the list of signals to transform and the new bit width as arguments.

Note that this is just an example transformation, and you may need to modify it to fit your specific use case. Additionally, this transformation will only work on Verilog/SystemVerilog code, and may not work on other programming languages or formats.
