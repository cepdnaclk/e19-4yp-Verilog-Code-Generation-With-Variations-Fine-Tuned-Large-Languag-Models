Here is a possible implementation of the transformation module for the xform framework:
```python
import argparse
import re
from pyverilog import parse, Directive, Node
from xform.visitors import AbstractVisitor

class ResetTransformer(AbstractVisitor):
    """
    Transforms reset condition from active-high to active-low or vice versa.
    """
    def __init__(self, signal_name):
        self.signal_name = signal_name
        self.changes_made = []
        self.signal_found = False

    def visit(self, node):
        if isinstance(node, Directive):
            # Check for reset directive
            if node.name == "rst":
                self.signal_found = True
                self.changes_made.append(f"Found {self.signal_name}")

                # Update sensitivity lists (posedge to negedge)
                for c in node.children():
                    self.visit(c)

            # Visit children
            for c in node.children():
                self.visit(c)

        elif isinstance(node, Node):
            # Check for reset usage in if statements
            if isinstance(node.parent, Directive) and node.parent.name == "if":
                for child in node.children():
                    self.visit(child)

    def post_visit(self):
        if self.signal_found:
            # Perform text transformations
            modified_content = re.sub(r"\breset\b", r"\!reset", self.changes_made[0])
            self.changes_made.append(modified_content)

    def transform(self, input_file, output_file):
        # Parse AST
        ast, directives = parse([input_file])

        # Apply visitor
        self.visit(ast)

        # Perform text transformations
        with open(output_file, "w") as f:
            f.write(self.changes_made[0])

        return True

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
parser.add_argument("-s", "--signal", help="Name of reset signal")
args = parser.parse_args()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    if args.signal:
        signal_name = args.signal
        transformation = ResetTransformer(signal_name)
        success = transformation.transform(input_file, output_file)
        print(f"Successfully transformed {output_file}")
    else:
        print("Please provide the name of the reset signal")
```
Explanation:

1. The `ResetTransformer` class inherits from the `AbstractVisitor` class provided by xform. It defines a few attributes and methods to perform the reset transformation.
2. The `__init__` method initializes the `signal_name` attribute and sets up the visitor's state.
3. The `visit` method is overridden to handle the reset directive, sensitivity lists, and if statements. It visits each node in the AST and performs the appropriate transformations.
4. The `post_visit` method is called after the entire AST has been visited. It checks if the `signal_found` flag is set and performs text transformations if necessary.
5. The `transform` method takes an input file, output file, and a signal name as arguments. It parses the AST, applies the visitor, and performs text transformations. It returns `True` for success or `False` otherwise.
6. The main function calls the `transform` method if the input file is provided.

Note: This implementation assumes that the reset signal is used in an `if` statement. If the reset signal is used in a different context (e.g., `while`, `for`), you may need to modify the visitor accordingly. Additionally, this implementation only performs text transformations and does not handle any semantic changes required by the reset transformation.
