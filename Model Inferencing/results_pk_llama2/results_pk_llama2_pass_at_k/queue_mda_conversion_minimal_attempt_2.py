Introduction:
The following transformation module is designed to convert fixed arrays in Verilog/SystemVerilog to queue-based multi-dimensional arrays using the xform framework. The transformation follows a pattern of identifying target elements, using a visitor class, and performing text transformations using regular expressions (regex). The module includes proper error handling and validation, and it can be used as a standalone tool or integrated with existing xform patterns.

Module Structure:
The transformation module consists of the following components:

1. Imports: The module imports necessary libraries such as pyverilog, re, argparse, etc. to perform the transformations.
2. Visitor Class: The visitor class inherits from an existing xform pattern and defines the logic for identifying target elements in the Verilog/SystemVerilog code.
3. Transformation Functions: The transformation functions use regex to perform the actual text transformations on the identified target elements. These functions include handling multiple dimensions, bounded and unbounded queues, and preserving the base signal type and width.
4. Main Transformation Function: The main transformation function takes in a Verilog/SystemVerilog file as input and applies the transformation using the visitor class and transformation functions.
5. Command-Line Interface: The module includes a command-line interface for running the transformation on a given input file.
6. Docstrings: The module includes comprehensive docstrings for each component to provide proper documentation and usage guidelines.

Transformer Pattern:
xform.Pattern("transformer", "Transforms fixed arrays to queue-based multi-dimensional arrays")

Main Function:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="Transform Verilog/SystemVerilog file")
    parser.add_argument("input_file", help="The input Verilog/SystemVerilog file")
    args = parser.parse_args()
    result = main(args.input_file)
    if result:
        print("Transformation successful!")
    else:
        print("Transformation failed!")
