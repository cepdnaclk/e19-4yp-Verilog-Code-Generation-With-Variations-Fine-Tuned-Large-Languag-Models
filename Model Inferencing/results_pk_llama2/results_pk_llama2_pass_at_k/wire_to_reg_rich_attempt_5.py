To perform this transformation, we can create a visitor class that will traverse the AST of the Verilog file and replace all occurrences of 'wire' with 'reg'. Here is an example of how this could be implemented:
```python
import pyverilog
from typing import List
from re import sub

class WireToRegVisitor(pyverilog.visitors.BaseVisitor):
    def __init__(self, signal_name):
        self.signal_name = signal_name
        self.changes_made = []
        self.signal_found = False
    
    def visit(self, node):
        if isinstance(node, pyverilog.nodes.Wire):
            self.signal_found = True
            self.changes_made.append(f"Replacing 'wire' with 'reg' in {node.name}")
            node.name = f"{self.signal_name}{node.name}"
        elif isinstance(node, pyverilog.nodes.Decl):
            for item in node.list:
                if hasattr(item, "name") and item.name == self.signal_name:
                    self.signal_found = True
                    self.changes_made.append(f"Replacing 'wire' with 'reg' in {item.name}")
                    item.name = f"{self.signal_name}{item.name}"
        else:
            for c in node.children():
                self.visit(c)
    
def transform(input_file, output_file, signal_name):
    # Parse AST
    ast, directives = parse([input_file])
    
    # Apply visitor
    visitor = WireToRegVisitor(signal_name)
    visitor.visit(ast)
    
    # Perform text transformations
    with open(input_file, "r") as f:
        content = f.read()
    
    modified_content = sub(r'(\bwire\b)|(\breserve)', r'\\1reg', content)
    
    # Write output
    with open(output_file, "w") as f:
        f.write(modified_content)
    
    return True
```
This code defines a `WireToRegVisitor` class that inherits from the `BaseVisitor` class provided by the xform framework. The visitor class has a few methods:

* `__init__`: Initializes the visitor with the signal name to replace 'wire' with.
* `visit`: This is the main method of the visitor class, which is called for each node in the AST. It checks if the current node is a `Wire` or `Decl` node, and if so, it replaces the `wire` keyword with `reg`. If the current node is not either of those types, it recursively calls the `visit` method on its children.
* `changes_made`: This is a list that keeps track of the changes made by the visitor. We use this to log each replacement.
* `signal_found`: This is a boolean variable that indicates if the signal name has been found. If it has, we know that all instances of 'wire' in the file need to be replaced.

The `transform` function takes three arguments: `input_file`, `output_file`, and `signal_name`. It first parses the AST using the `parse` function provided by xform, then applies the visitor using the `visit` method. Finally, it performs text transformations on the input file using regular expressions, and writes the modified content to the output file.

To use this transformation, you can run the following command:
```bash
python -m transform_wire_to_reg input.verilog output.v
```
This will apply the transformation to the `input.verilog` file and write the modified `output.v` file.
