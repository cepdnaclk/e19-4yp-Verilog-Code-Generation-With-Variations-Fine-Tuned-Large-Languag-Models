 Here is a proposed transformation module for the xform framework that performs the task of changing a signal's bit width specification:
```
import pyverilog
from PyVerilog import *
from re import search
from argparse import ArgumentParser

class BitWidthTransformation(pyverilog.visitor.Visitor):
    """
    This visitor class performs the task of changing a signal's bit width specification.
    It follows the xform framework pattern, where it inherits from an existing visitor class and overrides the visit method.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, width):
        """
        Initializes the visitor with the new desired width.
        :param width: The new desired bit width for the signal.
        """
        self.width = width
        
    def visit(self, node):
        """
        This is the override of the visit method from the base class. It checks if the current node is a signal declaration and if so, it performs the actual transformation.
        :param node: The current node being visited.
        :return: True/False depending on the success of the transformation.
        """
        if isinstance(node, pyverilog.nodes.SignalDeclaration):
            signal_name = node.name
            original_width = node.width
            new_width = self.width
            
            # Handle input/output signals
            if node.input or node.output:
                raise ValueError(f"Can't change bit width of an input or output signal {signal_name}")
            
            # Handle reg and wire signals
            elif node.type == pyverilog.nodes.SignalType.REGISTER or \
                    node.type == pyverilog.nodes.SignalType.WIRE:
                if new_width != original_width:
                    raise ValueError(f"Can't change bit width of a register or wire signal {signal_name}")
            
            # Perform the actual transformation
            node.width = new_width
            return True
        else:
            return super().visit(node)
```
Here is an example of how to use this transformation module:
```
# Define the width of the signal we want to transform
new_width = 32

# Parse the Verilog code using pyverilog
verilog_code = """
module my_module (output reg x, input wire y);
  signal z = 4;
endmodule
"""

# Create an instance of the transformation visitor and pass in the new width
transformation = BitWidthTransformation(new_width)

# Run the transformation on the Verilog code using the xform framework
result = xform.transform(verilog_code, transformation=transformation)

# Check if the transformation was successful
if result:
    print("The bit width of signal z was transformed successfully.")
else:
    print("The transformation failed.")
```
This code will transform the `z` signal in the provided Verilog code to have a bit width of 32. The transformation will also preserve the signal name and other attributes.

Note that this is just an example, you can adjust the width value and the verilog code to match your needs. Also, this transformation only handles signals that are not input/output or reg/wire, if you want to handle those cases as well you will have to modify the visitor class accordingly.
