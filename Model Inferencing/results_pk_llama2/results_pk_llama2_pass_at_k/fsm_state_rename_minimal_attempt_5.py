Title: RenameFSMStatesTransformer

Introduction:
The RenameFSMStatesTransformer is a transformation module for the xform framework that systematically renames FSM state names throughout a Verilog/SystemVerilog module. The transformer identifies FSM state enum/parameter declarations, renames all states matching a specified prefix pattern, updates references in case statements, and assignments/comparisons.

Requirements:
The transformation requires the following inputs:

* old_prefix: The prefix of the original FSM state names to be renamed.
* new_prefix: The new prefix for the renamed FSM states.

Functionality:
The RenameFSMStatesTransformer performs the following tasks:

1. Parses the Verilog/SystemVerilog module using PyVerilog.
2. Creates a visitor class inheriting from existing xform patterns.
3. Uses regular expressions (regex) to identify and rename FSM states matching the specified prefix pattern.
4. Updates all references in case statements to reflect the renamed states.
5. Updates assignments and comparisons that reference the renamed FSM states.
6. Returns True for successful transformation or False otherwise.

Implementation:
The RenameFSMStatesTransformer module includes the following components:

1. `rename_fsm_states.py`: This is the main Python file containing the transformation logic.
2. `visitor.py`: A visitor class inheriting from the existing xform patterns, which implements the renaming logic.
3. `main.py`: A main transformation function that calls the visitor class to perform the renaming.
4. `argparse.py`: A module for parsing command-line arguments, used in the main transformation function.
5. `docstrings.py`: A module containing comprehensive docstrings for each component file.

Usage:
To use the RenameFSMStatesTransformer, follow these steps:

1. Install PyVerilog using pip: `pip install pyverilog`
2. Run the transformation using the following command in the terminal/command prompt:
```bash
python rename_fsm_states.py --old_prefix=OLDPREFIX --new_prefix=NEWPREFIX <input_file.v>
```
Replace `<input_file.v>` with the path to your Verilog/SystemVerilog module, and `OLDPREFIX` and `NEWPREFIX` with the desired old and new prefixes, respectively.

Results:
After running the transformation, the renamed FSM states will be reflected in the modified module. The original FSM state names will have been replaced with their new counterparts.

Note: This transformation assumes that the FSM states are declared using enums or parameters. If your FSM states are declared differently, additional modifications may be required to accommodate the transformation.
