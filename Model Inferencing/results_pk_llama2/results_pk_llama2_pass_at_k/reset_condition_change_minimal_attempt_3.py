Here is an example of a transformation module for the xform framework that performs the task of changing the reset condition from active-high to active-low or vice versa:
```

from re import search

    This class performs the task of changing the reset condition from active-high to active-low or vice versa.

    The transformation also handles both synchronous and asynchronous reset patterns.
