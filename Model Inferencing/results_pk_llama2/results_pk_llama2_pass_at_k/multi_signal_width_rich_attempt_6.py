Here is an example of a transformation module for the xform framework that changes the bit width of multiple signals at once:
```python
import pyverilog
from pyverilog import *
from re import sub
from argparse import ArgumentParser

class BitWidthTransformer(pyverilog.Visitor):
    """
    Transforms Verilog/SystemVerilog code by changing the bit width of multiple signals at once.
    """
    def __init__(self, signal_names, new_width):
        self.signal_names = signal_names
        self.new_width = new_width
        self.visited = set()
    
    def visit(self, node):
        if isinstance(node, Node):
            for child in node.children():
                self.visit(child)
            # Check if any of the signals to be updated are found
            for sig in self.signal_names:
                if hasattr(node, sig):
                    # Update the bit width of the signal
                    setattr(node, sig, int(getattr(node, sig) * self.new_width))
                    # Mark the signal as visited to avoid recursive updates
                    self.visited.add(sig)
        elif isinstance(node, Decl):
            # Check if the declaration is for one of the signals to be updated
            for item in node.list:
                if hasattr(item, "name") and item.name in self.signal_names:
                    # Update the bit width of the signal
                    setattr(node, item.name, int(getattr(node, item.name) * self.new_width))
                    # Mark the signal as visited to avoid recursive updates
                    self.visited.add(item.name)
    
    def transform(self, file):
        ast = pyverilog.parse(file)
        self.visit(ast)
        return ast
    
def main():
    """
    The main function for the transformation.
    """
    parser = ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument("--signal-names", help="List of signals to be updated")
    parser.add_argument("--new-width", help="New bit width for the signals")
    
    args = parser.parse_args()
    
    visitor = BitWidthTransformer(args.signal_names, args.new_width)
    ast = visitor.transform(args.file)
    
    print(ast)
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
Here is an explanation of how the code works:

1. The `BitWidthTransformer` class inherits from `pyverilog.Visitor`, which means it will visit each node in the AST and perform operations on them.
2. The `__init__` method initializes the `signal_names` and `new_width` attributes of the visitor. `signal_names` is a list of signal names to be updated, and `new_width` is the new bit width for those signals.
3. The `visit` method is where the transformation happens. It checks each node in the AST to see if it is a declaration or a node with children. For declarations, it checks if the declared signal is one of the signals to be updated, and if so, updates its bit width. For nodes with children, it recursively visits each child to update any affected signals.
4. The `transform` method takes a file path as input and parses the Verilog/SystemVerilog code using `pyverilog.parse`. It then calls the `visit` method on the resulting AST to perform the transformation.
5. The `main` function is where the user can specify the input file path and any desired options (e.g., signal names to be updated, new bit width) using the command-line interface. It then calls the `transform` method to apply the transformation to the input file.
6. The code includes comprehensive docstrings for each function and class, making it easy to understand how to use and interpret the code.

Note that this code assumes that the signals to be updated are declared as integers, and that the new bit width is a valid value for that type of signal. It also assumes that there are no circular dependencies between the signals to be updated. If any of these assumptions are not true, additional error handling and validation may be needed.
