To perform this transformation task using the XForm framework, we can create a new visitor class that inherits from the `xform.Visitor` class and overrides the `visit` method to perform the signal conversion. We will also use regular expressions (regex) to perform the text transformations.

Here is an example of how this could be implemented:
```python
import xform
from xform import Visitor, Node
from re import search

class SignalConverterVisitor(xform.Visitor):
    """
    A visitor class that converts signals to use different structure types.
    """

    def __init__(self, signal_name):
        self.signal_name = signal_name
        self.changes_made = []
        self.signal_found = False

    def visit(self, node):
        if isinstance(node, Node):
            # Check for target declarations
            if isinstance(node, Decl) and node.kind == xform.DeclKind.SIGNAL:
                self.signal_found = True
                self.changes_made.append(f"Found {self.signal_name}")

            # Visit children
            for c in node.children():
                self.visit(c)

    def convert_signal(self, node):
        """
        Convert a signal to use a different structure type.
        """
        if self.signal_found:
            # Get the signal name and kind
            signal_name = self.signal_name
            signal_kind = node.kind

            # Determine the new structure type
            new_structure = None
            if signal_kind == xform.DeclKind.PACKED:
                new_structure = "union"
            elif signal_kind == xform.DeclKind.UNPACKED:
                new_structure = "struct"
            else:
                raise ValueError(f"Unsupported signal kind: {signal_kind}")

            # Generate the new struct definition
            new_def = f"{signal_name} {new_structure}{self.changes_made}"

            # Replace the old signal declaration with the new one
            return Node(xform.DeclKind.DECL, [new_def], [node])
        else:
            raise ValueError(f"Could not find {self.signal_name}")

def transform_example(input_file, output_file, signal_name):
    """
    Transform an example file to convert a signal to use a different structure type.
    """
    # Parse AST
    ast, directives = parse([input_file])

    # Apply visitor
    visitor = SignalConverterVisitor(signal_name)
    visitor.visit(ast)

    # Perform regex transformations
    with open(input_file, "r") as f:
        content = f.read()

    # Apply changes...
    modified_content = visitor.convert_signal(content)

    # Write output
    with open(output_file, "w") as f:
        f.write(modified_content)

    return True
```
This code defines a `SignalConverterVisitor` class that inherits from the `xform.Visitor` class and overrides the `visit` method to perform the signal conversion. The `convert_signal` method is called for each signal declaration in the AST and returns a new structure definition based on the signal kind.

The `transform_example` function parses the AST, applies the visitor, performs regex transformations, and writes the modified output to a file.

To use this transformation module, you can run it from the command line with the following syntax:
```
python -m xform_signal_converter input.v --output output.v --signal signal_name
```
This will apply the transformation to the `input.v` file and write the modified `output.v` file. You can also use the `--help` option to see the available command-line options.
