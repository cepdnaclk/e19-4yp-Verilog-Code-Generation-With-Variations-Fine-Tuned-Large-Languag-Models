## Submission

Submit a zip file containing:
- Your Python module(s) and test script(s).
- A README.md that contains:
    - The name of your module(s),
    - How to run the module,
    - Any assumptions you made about the input/output files (e.g., what kind of Verilog/SystemVerilog files are supported?),
    - Any limitations or caveats in the implementation.
- A test script that runs the module on a small set of test cases and compares the output to the expected results.
