**Task 2: Xform Module Template**

Generate a template Python module that can be used to generate transformation modules for the xform framework.

- Create a new PyVerilog file that contains a fixed array definition and an internal signal declaration with the same dimensions as the fixed array (i.e., [size_1][size_2])
- Use the `PyVerilog.ast_tools` module to parse, print, and traverse the AST in order to find fixed arrays and internal signals that match the array/signal size
- Create a template transformation module that contains the xform framework pattern for converting fixed arrays to multi-dimensional queues with 2 or more dimensions (i.e., [$:size_1][:$:size_2]) wherever possible
- Use a regex search and replace to find the target elements from the fixed array definition and internal signal declaration, and add the appropriate queue syntax to convert them into queues
