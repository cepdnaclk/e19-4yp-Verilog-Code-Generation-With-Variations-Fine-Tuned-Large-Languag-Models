# Problem 3: Verilog to VHDL

You are an expert in Verilog/SystemVerilog and HDLs. Generate a transformation 
module for the xform framework that performs the following task:

TASK: Change reset condition from active-high to active-low or vice versa

REQUIREMENTS:
- Find reset signal usage in if statements
- Change if(rst) to if(!rst) or vice versa
- Update sensitivity lists (posedge to negedge)
- Handle both synchronous and asynchronous reset patterns

The transformation should follow this pattern:
1. Use PyVerilog to parse and analyze the AST
2. Create a visitor class to identify target elements  
- A visitor class that inherits the pattern from existing xforms
3. Use regex to perform the actual text transformations
4. Include proper error handling and validation
5. Return True/False for success/failure

Generate a complete Python module with:
- Proper imports (pyverilog, re, argparse, etc.)
- A visitor class that inherits the pattern from existing xforms
- A main transformation function
- A command-line interface
- Comprehensive docstrings
