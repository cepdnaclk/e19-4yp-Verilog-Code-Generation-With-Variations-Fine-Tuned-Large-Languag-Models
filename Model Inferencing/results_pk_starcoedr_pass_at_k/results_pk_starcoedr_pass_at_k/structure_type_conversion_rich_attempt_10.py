This problem is a variation on the previous problem. In this case, you are asked to 
convert structs from one format (e.g., packed) into another (e.g., unpacked).  You'll need 
to generate member definitions for each struct.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Find target declarations that convert from one type to another
- Generate appropriate struct member definitions based on the old and new types
- Support blasted structure representations
  - AKA unions that have multiple elements

The transformation should follow this pattern:
1. Use PyVerilog to parse and analyze the AST
2. Create a visitor class to identify target elements

```python
class ExampleVisitor(StructureVisitor):
    def __init__(self, signal_name):
        self.signal_name = signal_name
        self.changes_made  = []

    def visit(self, node):
         # Check for target declarations
           if isinstance(node, Decl):
               for item in node.list:
                   # Skip non-StructDecls
                   if not isinstance(item, StructDecl):
                       continue

                   # Check for signal name
                   if hasattr(item, "name") and \
                      item.name == self.signal_name:
                       self.changes_made  = []
                       for member in item.members():
                           # Create struct member definitions
                           self._get_member_defs(self.changes_made, member)

            # Visit children
            for c in node.children():
                self.visit(c)

    def _get_member_defs(self, changes_made, member):
        # Get old and new structs
        old_struct = member["old"]
        new_struct = member["new"]

        # Skip non-StructDecls
        if not isinstance(old_struct, StructDecl):
            return

        # Create new StructDecl for each member of the old struct
        for item in old_struct.members():
             # Create new StructDecl for each member of the new struct
             if isinstance(item, StructMember) and \
                item["type"].name == "StructDecl":
                 new_struct.members().append(item["old"])
```

3. Include proper error handling and validation
4. Return True/False for success/failure
