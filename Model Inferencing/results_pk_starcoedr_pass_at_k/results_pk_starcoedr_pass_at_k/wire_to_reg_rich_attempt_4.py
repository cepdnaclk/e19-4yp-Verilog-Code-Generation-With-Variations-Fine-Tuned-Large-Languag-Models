## Part 2: Generate a complete Python module

You are an expert in Verilog/SystemVerilog and Python. Make a complete Python module that performs the following task:

1. Transform wire variables to reg variables. 
2. Find all wire declarations in the Verilog file. 
3. Replace 'wire' keyword with 'reg' keyword. 
4. Preserve bit widths and signal names.
5. Handle both single and multiple wire declarations.  
6. Include proper error handling and validation.
7. Return True/False for success/failure.
8. Use PyVerilog to parse and analyze the AST.
9. Create a visitor class that inherits the pattern from existing xforms. 
10. Use regex to perform the actual text transformations.  
11. Include a command-line interface that takes the input file path as an argument, and optionally, the output file name (defaults to 'output.txt') as well. 

The module should follow this pattern:

1. Import statements (pyverilog, re, argparse)
    1. Use pyverilog, since it offers a much easier interface than the native one, and also includes many built-in visitors for common tasks.  
    2. Use re to perform text transformations.  
    3. Use argparse to define command line options.
2. Visitor class that inherits the pattern from existing xforms
    1. It should take the signal name as an argument when initialized. 
    2. It should have a list of changes made, and a flag for whether or not it found any relevant elements in the AST. 
    3. It must implement a visitor method `visit` to visit each node in the AST.  
    4. This method must check the target elements using the signal name provided when the class was initialized.  
    5. If the signal is found, append its name and value to changes made list. 
    6. Finally call `self.visit(c)` on each of its children.
3. Transformation function that takes in input file path (string), output file path (optional string) and signal name
    1. Try to parse and analyze the AST from the input file using pyverilog's parser method `.parse()`. 
    2. Create a visitor class object with the desired signal name, and call its `visit` method on root of the AST tree.  
    3. Check if the signal was found by checking for the flag in the visitor instance.
    4. If not found, raise a warning that the signal is not used. 
    5. Apply transformations to the file contents using regex methods.  
    6. Write output from the modified content back to file.
4. Command line interface that takes input and optionally output file paths as arguments
    1. Try to parse and analyze the AST from the input file using pyverilog's parser method `.parse()`. 
    2. Create a visitor class object with the desired signal name, and call its `visit` method on root of the AST tree.  
    3. Check if the signal was found by checking for the flag in the visitor instance.
    4. If not found, raise a warning that the signal is not used. 
    5. Apply transformations to the file contents using regex methods.  
    6. Write output from the modified content back to file.
5. A main function that takes arguments and performs the transformation operation on the input file based on the command line interface.  
    1. Call the command-line interface if no argument is provided. 
    2. Otherwise call the transformation function with the arguments provided as inputs.  
6. Finally, include a proper docstring for your module.  

Make sure to import all necessary modules and classes from the framework so that it can be used in another project or reused as a part of the existing xform framework.
