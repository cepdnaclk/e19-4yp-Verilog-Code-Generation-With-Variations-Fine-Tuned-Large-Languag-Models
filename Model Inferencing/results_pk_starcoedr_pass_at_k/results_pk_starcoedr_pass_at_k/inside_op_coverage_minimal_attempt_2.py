## Question 2: Faster SAT Solvers

You are an expert in C and C++. Generate a transformation module for the 
xform framework that performs the following task:

TASK: Implement a faster version of Minisat that uses bit vectors to represent clauses.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Use bit vectors (e.g., std::vector<int>) instead of arrays to speed up processing.
  - For example, use std::bitset<10> or std::bitset<64> instead of int[10] or int[64].
- Include proper error handling and validation in the transformation (e.g., checking
  that input clauses are valid).
- Return True/False for success/failure.

The transformation should follow this pattern:
1. Use PyVerilog to parse and analyze the AST
2. Create a visitor class to identify target elements  
- Use bit vectors instead of arrays (e.g., std::vector<int>) to speed up processing.
  - For example, use std::bitset<10> or std::bitset<64> instead of int[10] or int[64].
3. Use regex to perform the actual text transformations
- Include proper error handling and validation in the transformation (e.g., checking that input clauses are valid).
4. Return True/False for success/failure.

Generate a complete Python module with:
- Proper imports (pyverilog, re, argparse, etc.)
- A visitor class that inherits the pattern from existing xforms
- A main transformation function
- A command-line interface 
- Comprehensive docstrings 

Make sure the code integrates properly with the existing xform framework patterns.
