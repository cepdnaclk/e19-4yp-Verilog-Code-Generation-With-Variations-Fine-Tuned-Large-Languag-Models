You are an expert in Verilog/SystemVerilog and Python. Generate a transformation 
module for the xform framework that performs the following task:

TASK: Rename any signal throughout a Verilog module

REQUIREMENTS:
- Take old_name and new_name as parameters
- Find all occurrences of the signal
- Replace in declarations, assignments, and references
- Ensure only whole word matches (not partial)

The transformation should follow this pattern:
1. Use PyVerilog to parse and analyze the AST
2. Create a visitor class to identify target elements  
3. Use regex to perform the actual text transformations
4. Include proper error handling and validation
5. Return True/False for success/failure

Generate a complete Python module with:
- Proper imports (pyverilog, re, argparse, etc.)
- A visitor class that inherits the pattern from existing xforms 
- A main transformation function
- A command-line interface
- Comprehensive docstrings

Make sure the code integrates properly with the existing xform framework patterns.
