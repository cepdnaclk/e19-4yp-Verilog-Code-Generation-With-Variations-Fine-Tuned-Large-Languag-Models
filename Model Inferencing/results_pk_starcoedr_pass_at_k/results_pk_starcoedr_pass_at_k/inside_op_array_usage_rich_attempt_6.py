## Design and Implementation

Describe how you will implement this task.  Use pseudocode or high level descriptions as much as possible.
This section should provide enough detail to implement a reasonable solution for this task.

### Algorithm

The algorithm involves the following steps:

1. Parse Verilog/SystemVerilog file(s) using pyverilog module (pyverilog.vparser) and extract the AST in the form of Node objects
2. Build a visitor class that identifies target elements based on their attributes
3. Use Python regular expressions to perform text transformations, as mentioned above.
4. Write output file with modifications made during this step.
5. Error handling and validation (e.g., syntax, type checking) should be implemented for the transformation module.

### Sample code

Provide a sample implementation of a transform module.  This will include imports, class definition, main method, and command line interface.  
<|begin_of_code|>
```python
import pyverilog.vparser as parser
from pyverilog import verilogast as ast
from pyverilog.vast import *


class ArrayVisitor(ast.NodeVisitor):
    def __init__(self, signalname):
        self._signalname = signalname
        self._found_signals = []
        self._found_index = 0

    # Check for declarations that match a signal name of interest 
    def visit_Decl(self, node: Decl) -> None:
        if isinstance(node.datatype, Array):
            dim = node.datatype
            self._found_signal = True

        for item in node.list:
            if hasattr(item, "name") and item.name == self._signalname:
                self._found_signals.append(f"Found {self._signalname}")
                self._found_index += 1

    # Check for declarations that match a signal name of interest 
    def visit_Assign(self, node):
        if isinstance(node.value, ast.BitSelect):
            self._found_signal = True

        for item in node.children():
            self.visit(item)


def xform_array_inside_operator(filename: str, outputname :str, signalname: str) -> bool:
    # Parse Verilog file
    verilogasts, directives  = parser.parse([filename])
    ast = verilogasts[0]

    # Create a visitor to find the signal name of interest 
    visitor = ArrayVisitor(signalname)
    for node in ast.children():
        visitor.visit(node)

    # Check if signal was found in the AST, otherwise return
    if not visitor._found_signals:
        return False
    
    # Modify the file's text content using regular expressions (re module).
    # You can use pyverilog.vparser.dump_json() to print out the Verilog AST 
    # that is built from the source code
    with open(filename, "r") as f:
        content  = f.read()

    # Apply transformations and write output file
    modifiedcontent = re.sub(pattern, replacement, content)

    with open(outputname, 'w') as f:
        f.write(modifiedcontent)

    return True
```

## Evaluation

Your implementation will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

1. The algorithm/implementation is correct and implemented in accordance to the standards of the xform framework.
2. Code quality (efficiency, robustness) of the algorithm implementation
3. Implementation of the test suite and document the procedures for running these tests.
4. Documentation of implementation
5. Documentation of design
6. Completeness/correctness of the test cases that are included in this task.  You can assume the target signal is present in all test cases.
7. Code quality of the implementation (efficiency, robustness)
8. Documentation of testing procedures and document any special considerations taken when running these tests.
