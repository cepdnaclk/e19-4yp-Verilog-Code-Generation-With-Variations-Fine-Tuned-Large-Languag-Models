## <a name="fixed_dynamic"></a>Fixed Array to Dynamic Array Conversion: 2pts

You are an expert in Verilog/SystemVerilog and Python. Generate a transformation module for the xform framework that performs the following task:

TASK: Convert fixed arrays to dynamic multi-dimensional arrays

REQUIREMENTS:
- Find fixed array declarations
- Convert to dynamic array syntax with [] dimensions
- Handle multiple dimensions as specified
- Preserve base signal type and width
- Generate proper initialization code

The transformation should follow this pattern:
1. Use PyVerilog to parse and analyze the AST
2. Create a visitor class to identify target elements  
- Convert fixed array declarations to dynamic array syntax with [] dimensions
- Handle multiple dimensions as specified (ie. 3D or 4D) - must be flexible enough to handle any array dimensionality in the input signal file.
- Preserve base signal type and width
- Generate proper initialization code for each signal that was transformed

3. Include proper error handling and validation
4. Return True/False for success/failure


5. Generate a complete Python module with:
    - Proper imports (pyverilog, re, argparse, etc.)
    - A visitor class that inherits the pattern from existing xforms
    - A main transformation function
    - A command-line interface
    - Comprehensive docstrings

Make sure the code integrates properly with the existing xform framework patterns.
