Hints:
- Use PyVerilog to parse and analyze the AST of the Verilog file being transformed
- Try using pyverilog.ast.top module to find all wire declarations in the AST
- You should use pyverilog.ast.Wire instead of pyverilog.ast.declaration.Wire to identify wires since a wire declaration can be either a single or multiple wires 
- PyVerilog also has a visitor pattern that could help you here
