## [Optional] Advanced Task: Create a custom transformer

Task 5 is not required to complete the course, but would be an excellent learning exercise. 

For reference, here are the requirements for a custom transformer (from the original xform framework):

1. Find signal declarations and record their names in a list/set
2. Convert all signal types to int
3. Replace integer constants with 0s
4. Remove any signal assignments that were modified by this transformer 
5. Return True/False for success/failure
