You are an expert in Verilog/SystemVerilog and Python. Generate a transformation 
module for the xform framework that performs the following task:

TASK: Change a signal name throughout the file

REQUIREMENTS:
- Find signal declaration with old name
- Replace signal name in declaration
- Update any references to signal name in comments, module name, etc.
- Preserve all signal contents and port lists
  
The transformation should follow this pattern:
1. Use PyVerilog to parse and analyze the AST 
2. Create a visitor class to identify target elements  
3. Use regex to perform the actual text transformations
4. Include proper error handling and validation   
5. Return True/False for success/failure

Generate a complete Python module with:
- Proper imports (pyverilog, re, argparse, etc.)  
- A visitor class that inherits the pattern from existing xforms 
- A main transformation function 
- A command-line interface   
- Comprehensive docstrings
