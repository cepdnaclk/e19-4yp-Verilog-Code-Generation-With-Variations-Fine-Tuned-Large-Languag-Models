# Problem 3: Verilog/SystemVerilog syntax parser

You are an expert in Verilog and SystemVerilog and Python. Generate a transformation module for the xform framework that performs the following task:

TASK: Convert fixed-size arrays to dynamic arrays

REQUIREMENTS:
- Recognize fixed array declarations using "integer" indexing (e.g., "a[i] is 10")
- Create a new variable of the same name/dimensionality but dynamic size and declare it in place of original declaration
- Add a function call to initialize the array with 0s before use
- Update references to the fixed array that were indexed by constant numbers (e.g., "a[i]")
  - If the index is not constant, convert it to an associative array reference (e.g., "a[{i}]")
- If the fixed array was used in an arithmetic expression, convert the indices to associative array references as well (e.g., "a[i+1] + 2")
- Remove all instances of "integer" indexing from the new dynamic array variable declaration. It should be left as "dyn_array[i]" with no additional index notation.
- Generate proper mixed syntax for associative and fixed arrays (e.g., "dyn[{i}]") instead of "dyn[i]"
  - Use regular expressions to parse the array references to extract the indices
- If the fixed array was used in an arithmetic expression, convert the indices to associative array references as well (e.g., "a[{i}+1] + 2")
- Update all instances of indexing to associative array syntax where possible (e.g., a[i][j][k] -> a[{i}][{j}][{k}])
  - For example, the following statements should be converted:
    - "if (a[i][j] == 1)" --> "if (a[{i}][{j}] == 1)"
    - "a[i][j] = 2" --> "a[{i}][{j}] = 2"
- Update all references to associative arrays using regular expressions. It should be left as "a[{i}][{j}]" instead of "a[i][j]"
  - For example, the following statements should be converted:
    - "if (a == 1)" --> "if ({a} == 1)"
    - "a = a + b" --> "{a} = {a} + {b}"
- The fixed array name/index references must not be modified. It should only be replaced by associative array syntax where possible, and the new array name must remain as "a" (e.g., "a[i][j]" -> a[{i}][{j}]")

The transformation should follow this pattern:
1. Use PyVerilog to parse and analyze the AST
2. Create a visitor class to identify target elements  
- Visit all instances of fixed array indexing (e.g., "a[i]")
  - If the fixed array is in an arithmetic expression, convert the indices as well (e.g., "(a[i] + 1)")
3. Use regex to perform the actual text transformations
4. Include proper error handling and validation
5. Return True/False for success/failure
