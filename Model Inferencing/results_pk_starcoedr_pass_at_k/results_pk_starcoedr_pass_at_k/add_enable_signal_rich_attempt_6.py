## Explanation

The module contains 4 classes:
- `Transform` - Contains the main transformation function (also called `transformer`) that uses the Visitor pattern to modify Verilog/SystemVerilog source code. The class also includes a method for performing error checks and validation.
- `CounterIncVisitor` - A visitor class that identifies target elements in the AST by their name. It then iterates through all instances of the identified name, adds an enable signal as new input port to each increment statement, and wraps each increment with an enable condition. In addition, it preserves existing sensitivity lists and reset logic by appending a new `posedge` sensitivity list at the top-level module.
- `TransformCLIArgumentParser` - A class that extends the built-in argparse module to add a positional argument for input/output files. It also includes a method `check_file` to check whether each file exists and is readable. This method is used by the main transformation function (see above).
- `CounterIncTransformer` - A class that contains a main method (`run`) that calls the Transform class's transformer method with appropriate arguments based on command line input, performs error checks/validation, and returns True if successful. It also includes methods for setting default values to certain arguments in case they are not provided by the user via CLI. 

The transform CLI looks like this:
```
usage: xform.py [-h] [-i INPUT_FILE] [-o OUTPUT_FILE] [signal_name]

Transformer for adding an enable signal and wrapping counter increments

positional arguments:
  signal_name        signal name to add as input port (default: 'enable')

optional arguments:
  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
  -i INPUT_FILE      input file containing Verilog/SystemVerilog code (default:
                     'input.sv')
  -o OUTPUT_FILE     output file for modified Verilog/SystemVerilog code
                     (default: 'output.sv')
```
