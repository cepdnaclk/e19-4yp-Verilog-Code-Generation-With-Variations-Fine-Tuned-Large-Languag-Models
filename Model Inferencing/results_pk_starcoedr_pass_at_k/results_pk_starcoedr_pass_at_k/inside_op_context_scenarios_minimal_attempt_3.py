HINTS:
- The inside operator is an unfortunate keyword that is not available in python
- Use pyverilog to parse and analyze the AST
- Create a visitor class to identify target elements
    - Identify the appropriate syntax elements
        - if statements (if, else, else_if)
        - loops (while/for/case)
    - Identify the proper cases to handle for each element type in the target list above. 
- Use regex to perform text transformations 
    - Replace a string with a new one or add text at appropriate positions
        - This is not as simple as it looks because there may be many of these elements
    - Consider how to use backreferences so that you can reuse the same regular expressions over and over again
        - https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html#back-references
- Use a visitor class with pattern from existing xforms as a starting point
- Include proper error handling (use exceptions)
    - In the case of syntax errors, raise an exception that includes the appropriate line and column number 
    - In the case of semantic errors or other validation problems, raise an exception that reports it to the user 
- Return True/False for success/failure
