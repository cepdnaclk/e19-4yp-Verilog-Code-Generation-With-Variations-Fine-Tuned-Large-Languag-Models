    This visitor pattern will be used to find signal declarations that need 
    updating and modify their bit widths. The pattern will match on:
    - Unpacked signals
    - Packed signals
    - Signals with multiple unpacked arrays
    - Signals with packed array components that need updating

    Patterns are defined using Python regular expressions (re). They can be 
    combined into larger patterns to make more powerful searches. 

    Matching will occur in a greedy fashion, where the first match is always used. 
    If there are multiple matches, the first one found is used.
