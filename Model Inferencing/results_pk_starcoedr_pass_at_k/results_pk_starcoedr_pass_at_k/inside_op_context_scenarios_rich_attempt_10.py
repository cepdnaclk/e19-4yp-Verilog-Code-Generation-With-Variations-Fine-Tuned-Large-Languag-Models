    pass #TODO: Implement!
```

### 14.2: Create test cases for inside operator in different contexts

To add this functionality to the transform framework we need to first create a 
visitor class that will identify and track target declarations as they are encountered. 
In the case of an inside operator, we want to ensure the visitor finds declarations by 
name, not index.

The following pattern can be used as reference:
```python
class ExampleVisitor(TransformVisitor):
    def __init__(self):
        self.signal_name = None

    # Target declarations
    def visit_Decl(self, node):
        for item in node.list:
            if hasattr(item, "name"):
                self.visit(item)

    # Visit children
    def visit(self, node):
        for c in node.children():
            self.visit(c)
```

Now that we have a visitor class, we need to implement the logic in 
the `inside_xform` function using our visitor pattern:

1. Parse input Verilog/SystemVerilog file into an AST by calling the `parse` module from PyVerilog
    - This will return a tuple of the parsed AST and directives that were encountered during parsing 
    ```python
    # Parse input Verilog source code
    ast, directives = pyverilog.parser.parse(filename)

    # Return tuple of (ast, directives) 
    return (ast, directives)
    ```
2. Create an instance of your visitor class
    - This will populate the `self.signal_name` attribute with a name for the inside operator you are testing 
3. Call the `visit` method on that instance to initiate the search of the target declarations in the parsed AST 
    - This will call the `visit` method for each node encountered in the AST
    ```python
    # Create visitor instance and populate self.signal_name with a name for the inside operator you want to test
    visitor = ExampleVisitor(signal_name)

    # Initialize visitor by calling visit on top-level node of parsed AST 
    visitor.visit(ast)
    ```
4. Iterate through each instance of target declarations in the parsed AST and compare the name attribute against your target inside operator name.
    - For every matched declaration, you should add a change to `self.changes_made`
    ```python
    # Find target decls by iterating AST
    for node in ast:
        if isinstance(node, pyverilog.ast.Decl):
            for item in node.list:
                # Check for target decls 
                if hasattr(item, "name") and item.name == signal_name
                    self.changes_made.append(f"Found {signal_name}")
    ```
5. Repeat the above steps to test your new inside operator in a procedural context 
    - Use the `pyverilog.ast` module instead of the `pyverilog.transform` module for procedural contexts 
```python
# Parse input Verilog source code into an AST using pyverilog.ast.parse() and directives
# Do not use pyverilog.parser.parse() because pyverilog.ast.parse() will return a tuple of (ast, directives)
ast = pyverilog.ast.parse(filename)

# Create instance of your visitor class 
visitor = ExampleVisitor(signal_name) 

# Initialize the visitor by calling visit on top-level node of parsed AST. 
visitor.visit(ast)
```
6. Return True if the inside operator was found in the target declarations, otherwise return False
    - This will allow the test to pass/fail based upon the results populated in `self.changes_made` 
    ```python
    # Return True or False depending on self.changes_made is empty of not
    return len(self.changes_made) > 0
    ```
7. Create a new function called `inside_xform()` that contains the logic for applying the xform to the input file and performing text replacements 
    - This should follow the `xform` module pattern. You will need to use `pyverilog.transform.text` to perform the text transformations 
8. Add a test case using your `inside_xform()` function
    - Use the `assert` module for error handling. You can use `assert len(self.changes_made) > 0, "Inside operator not found"` 
    ```python
    # Test: inside_xform() should find the correct inside operator in target declarations and procedural contexts
    assert inside_xform(input_file, output_file), f"Found {self.signal_name}"
    ```
9. Add a test case for your new inside operator transformation to `test_inside_operator()` 
    - Use a custom regex pattern to match the inside operator and capture the signal name at its location in the text 
    ```python
    # Test: inside_xform() should find the correct inside operator in target declarations and procedural contexts
    assert inside_xform(input_file, output_file), f"Found {self.signal_name}"
    ```
10. Add a test case for your new inside operator transformation to `test_inside_operator()` 
    - Use a custom regex pattern to match the inside operator and capture the signal name at its location in the text

    # Test: inside_xform() should find the correct inside operator in target declarations and procedural contexts
    assert inside_xform(input_file, output_file), f"Found {self.signal_name}"
    ```
