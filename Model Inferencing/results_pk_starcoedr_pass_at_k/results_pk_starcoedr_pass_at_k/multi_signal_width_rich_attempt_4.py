## Part 2: Generate a transformer

Generate a Python module that inherits from `pyverilog.ast.verilog.transforms.Transform` and defines a method called `apply`. The method takes one argument, which is an instance of `pyverilog.ast.verilog.nodes.Node`. This argument represents the root node in the Verilog/SystemVerilog AST that we want to modify.

Write a new transformer class using the existing pattern from Part 1. In the `apply` method you will implement your transformation logic here. The transformed output should be returned to be used by the framework.

## Part 3: Generate a command-line utility

Generate a Python script that takes as input a Verilog/SystemVerilog file and writes a transformed version of it out. It should accept two arguments, the input filename and the output filename. You can assume the target signal is always the first signal in an array (e.g., `sig[3]`). 

The command-line interface should support: 
- A `-n` flag that takes a signal name argument to perform the transformation on. This must be the first positional argument.
- A `-w` flag that takes a new width as an integer input. The width must be between `0` and `32`.
- An optional `-o` flag that accepts a file path for output filename, using the filename from the `-n` flag if omitted.

## Part 4: Generate unit tests

Generate a set of unit tests that validates your transformer class in various scenarios with inputs/outputs provided by the project. Your unit test should include at least these sections:
- Validates that the transformer can find and update the bit width of a signal declaration (without changing any other element)
- Validates that the transformer handles packed and unpacked array declarations correctly
- Validates that the transformer raises an error if the new bit width is not syntactically correct
