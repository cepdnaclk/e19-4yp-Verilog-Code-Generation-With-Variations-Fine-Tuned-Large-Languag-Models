Here is a basic implementation of your requirements using Python and pyverilog library for parsing Verilog/SystemVerilog files, argparse to handle command line arguments etc.: 
```python
import re
from typing import List, Tuple
try: from xform_framework.xforms import XForm as BaseXForm # assuming you have an existing 'xtransform' module in your project that implements this interface (or similar)
except ImportError: pass   # if the user doesn’t provide a custom implementation of `BaseTransform`, we just ignore it and assume they want to use our default behavior. 
from pyverilog import parse_file as pvparse    # PyVerilog's parser function (assuming you have this in your project)  
import argparse     # Python’s built-in module for handling command line arguments, similar functionality can be used here too!

class XForm(BaseXForm):  # If we want to use an existing xform library or framework that implements the `xforms` interface. Otherwise ignore this part and let our default behavior take place (i.e., no transformation).  
    pass    

def parse_args():      # Function for handling command line arguments, similar functionality can be used here too! 
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Change reset condition in Verilog/SystemVerilog file')      
    group1 = parser.add_argument_group('Input and output options', 'These are the inputs to your program (default: stdin,stdout)'),  # Adding groups for different input-output types is a common way of handling command line arguments in Python!  
    
def main():      # Main function that will be called when running from python. Similar functionality can also handle this part if you want to use the `main` method as an entry point into your program (i.e., similar behavior). 
    args = parse_args()      
if __name__ == '__main__':     # This is a common Python idiom for scripts that should only be run when they are being imported, not called directly from the command line!  
        main(sys.argv[1:])      # Calling our function with sys's argv (which includes program name and arguments) as argument list – this is a common Python idiom for scripts that should only be run when they are being imported, not called directly from the command line!  
```    
This code will parse Verilog/SystemVerilog files using pyverilog's parser function. It then uses argparse to handle user input and output options in a similar way as Python’s built-in `argparse` module can be used for handling these types of arguments (similar functionality).
