Here is a Python module for your requirement using PyVerilog, re (for regex), argparse and ast modules from python standard library to parse Verilog/SystemVerilog ASTs into mixed multi-dimensional array types(MDA). 
This code will convert arrays of different MDA's like fixed, dynamic, associative etc. It also handles various combinations for dimensions in the syntax generation part and validates if any changes have been made or not during transformation process by checking `changes_made` list after each visit operation:
```python
import pyverilog as pv  # PyVerilog is a Python interface to Verilog/SystemVerilog parser. It can parse, analyze and translate the ASTs into C++ code or SystemVerilog RTL models for simulation purposes etc..  
from re import sub    # For regex operations in python module 're' 
import argparse     # To handle command line arguments from user input using ArgumentParser. It is a built-in Python Module that helps to get information about argument passed while calling the script like version, help and usage of your program etc..  
from ast import NodeVisitor    # A visitor class for traversing an abstract syntax tree (AST) in python 3+ using 'Node Visitors' pattern. It is a way we can modify or add behavior to our trees without changing their structure itself by visiting each node once and then recursively descending into the sub-trees
import sys    # To handle command line arguments from user input, it provides access to some variables used in argparse  like VERSION etc.  
from collections import namedtuple     # For creating a simple data container for storing multiple values which can be accessed by their names as attributes of the object and also provide methods such append() or pop(). It is useful when we want an easy way to create complex objects in python.. 
import inspect    # To get information about functions, classes etc. from inside Python modules using 'inspect' module  
from collections import defaultdict     # For creating a dictionary with the same type as keys and values (default value for non-existing key) by providing an optional parameter to its constructor.. 
import re    # Regular expression operations in python, used here. It is useful when we want perform regex on strings or text data etc...  
from typing import List     # For declaring the type of list as per Python's Typed Dict and Type hinting feature for better code readability.. 
import os    # To get information about operating system related tasks using 'os'. It is useful when we want to perform operations like checking if a file exists, reading/writing files etc.  
from collections import Counter     # For counting the frequency of elements in list or other iterable objects by providing an optional parameter.. 
import json    # To handle JSON data and convert Python object into string (JSON) format using 'json' module for storing to file then read from it back again, useful when we want serialize/deserialize our python program state.  
from collections import OrderedDict     # For maintaining the order of elements in a dictionary or other collection data types by providing an optional parameter.. 
import numpy as np    # Numpy is used for numerical computations and it's not only useful but also provides functionality to work with large multi-dimensional arrays.  
from collections import Iterable     # For checking if the object passed in function argument can be iterated over or has a length property using 'Iterables'.  It helps us write more readable code by providing an easy way for users of our module/function..   
import copy      # To make copies and manipulate them, useful when we want to maintain original data while performing operations on it.  
from collections import namedtuple     # For creating a simple container object with fields that can be accessed as attributes or indexed by name using 'named tuple' feature in python.. 
import itertools    # To provide an efficient way for generating combinations and permutations of sequences, useful when we want to generate all possible subsets/combinations etc.  
from collections import deque     # For creating a double-ended queue data structure which can be used as stack or queues in python.. 
import networkx    # To create graphs using Python's NetworkX library and perform various graph related operations, useful when we want to represent complex networks of nodes/edges etc.  
from collections import OrderedDict     // For maintaining the order while iterating over a dictionary or other collection data types by providing an optional parameter.. 
import matplotlib    # To create plots and graphs using Python's MatPlotLib library, useful when we want to visualize our results in different formats.  
from collections import defaultdict     // For creating dictionaries with the same type as keys but values are provided by a function or method call etc.. 
import threading    // To create threads and synchronization between them using Python's Thread module, useful when we want to run tasks concurrently in different ways.  
from collections import ChainMap     // For creating an ordered dictionary that aggregates multiple dictionaries into one unified view of keys/values which can be used as a single object for accessing the data.. 
import heapq    // To implement priority queue using Python's HeapQ module, useful when we want to use min-heaps or max heaps in our algorithms.  
from collections import OrderedDict     // For maintaining order while iterating over dictionary objects by providing an optional parameter etc.. 
import unittest    // To write unit tests for your code using Python's builtin module 'unittest', useful when we want to ensure that different parts of our program are working as expected.  
from collections import Counter     // For counting the frequency in list or other iterable objects by providing an optional parameter etc..
