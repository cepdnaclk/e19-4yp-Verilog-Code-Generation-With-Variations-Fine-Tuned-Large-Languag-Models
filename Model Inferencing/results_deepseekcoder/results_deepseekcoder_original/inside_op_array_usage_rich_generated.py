Here is a Python module for your requirement using PyVerilog and re (for regex operations). This script will parse Verilog source files, apply transformations to them based on certain rules defined in an `ExampleVisitor` class that you provided earlier. 

```python
import pyverilog as pv
from example_visitor import ExampleVisitor   # Your custom visitor pattern here!
import re    # For regex operations (sub, findall etc.)
import argparse     # To handle command line arguments in Python scripting language

def transform(inputfile: str , outputfile :str): 
        """Main transformation function"""     
         with open(output_path,'w') as fout:   # Open the file for writing. Use 'with' to ensure it gets closed properly at end of block    
             p = ExampleVisitor()    # Instantiate your custom visitor pattern here!  (You need a constructor in this class)     
              with open(inputfile, "r") as f:   # Open the file for reading. Use 'with' to ensure it gets closed properly at end of block    
                   content =f.read()    # Read all contents from input_path into string variable named `content`  (use your custom visitor pattern here!)     
              p.visit(pv.parse(inputfile))   # Parse the AST using pyverilog and apply visit method on it with content    
               matches = re.findall('\$write', content)    # Find all occurrences of '$write' in `content` (use your custom visitor pattern here!)     
              for match in matches:   # Loop over each found occurrence  and apply regex transformations on it using the same method as above    
                   new_match = re.sub('\s*(\w+)\(', '[\\1]={0} ', match)    # Replace occurrences of `$write` with a function call index test case (use your custom visitor pattern here!)     
               fout.writelines([new_match])   # Write the transformed string to output file    
         return True  # Return true if no errors occurred, false otherwise   
```       
This script will parse Verilog source files and apply transformations based on certain rules defined in an `ExampleVisitor` class that you provided earlier. The transformation is done using PyVerilog's AST parsing capabilities to identify target elements (in this case: '$write') within the code, then use regex operations for text substitutions of these occurrences with test cases based on your custom visitor pattern.
