Here is a basic example of how you could structure your Python module to meet these requirements using PyVerilog for parsing and analysis, regex for text transformations, argparse for command-line interface handling etc.: 

```python
import pyverilog as pv
from re import search
import sys
sys.path.append('./xform') # Add the directory where your xforms are located to Python's path
# Import all necessary modules from 'xform'. This is a placeholder, replace it with actual module names and functions 
try:  
    from my_module import *    
except Exception as e:      
    print(f"Error occurred while trying to load xforms. Error message was {str(e)}")     
# End of try-catch block for error handling in the 'my_module' file 
try:  
    from myxform import *     # Replace with actual module name and function names      
except Exception as e:         
    print("Error occurred while trying to load xforms. Error message was {str(e)}")     
# End of try-catch block for error handling in the 'my_module' file 
try:  
    from myxform2 import *     # Replace with actual module name and function names      
except Exception as e:         
    print("Error occurred while trying to load xforms. Error message was {str(e)}")     
# End of try-catch block for error handling in the 'my_module' file 
```  
The above code imports all necessary modules from your project and checks if they are accessible or not, then it tries executing them with a catch statement to handle any exceptions that might occur. The xform functions should be defined within these try-catch blocks as well for error handling in case of failure during execution. 
  
The command line interface is handled by argparse module which allows you pass arguments from the terminal when running your script, and it's used to parse those inputs into variables that can then use inside xform functions or methods:   
```python
# Command-line Interface using ArgumentParser in Python 3.x  
if __name__ == "__main__":     # Check if the file is being run directly, not imported as a module     
        parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()      
        args = parser.parse_args()   
```        
The xform functions are defined in separate modules (myxforms and myotherxs) which can be used inside your main script:  
 ```python  # Example of a simple transformation function using PyVerilog's AST    
def transform(ast):      
        visitor = MyVisitor()    // Replace with actual class name     
         return ast.accept_visitor(visitor)         
```          
The docstrings are used to provide information about the purpose of each function, argument and variable in your code:  
 ```python  # Example for a simple transformation    
def transform1():       // Replace with actual method name     
    """Transform one thing"""        return True if successful else False.         If not all tests pass then it returns false otherwise true."""          def __call__(self, ast):           self._ast = ast            # Call the visitor's visit_<AST> function and store result in _result:             ...
```  
This is a very basic example of how you could structure your Python module to meet these requirements. You would need more complex code for each xform task, error handling etc., but this should give you an idea on the way forward with PyVerilog's AST and argparse in python:  https://pyverilog-asttools/
