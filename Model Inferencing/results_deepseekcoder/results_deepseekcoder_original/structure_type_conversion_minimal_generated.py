Here is a basic example of how you could structure your Python module to meet these requirements using PyVerilog for parsing and analysis, regex for text transformations, argparse for command-line interface handling etc.: 

```python
import pyverilog as pv
from re import search
import sys
sys.path.append('./xform') # Add the directory where your xforms module is located to Python's path so it can find our custom visitor class and transformation functions
# Importing necessary modules from 'argparse', which allows you create command-line interfaces 
from argparse import ArgumentParser, RawDescriptionHelpFormatter  
import inspect    # For getting the caller function name for error handling.    

class SignalVisitor(pv.XformModule):     
# Your visitor class should inherit from pv.XformBase and implement your custom methods here 
        pass        
      
def x_convert():  
    # Implement the transformation logic in this function, using PyVerilog's AST to find signal declarations    
    parser = ArgumentParser(description="Convert signals", formatter_class=RawDescriptionHelpFormatter) 
# Adding command-line arguments here. This will be used for error handling and validation  
parser.add_argument('file', type=str, help='Verilog file to convert')     # File argument   
args = parser.parse_args()     
try:       
with open(args.file) as fp :        
line = fp.readlines () 
# Your code here that uses Pyverilog AST and regexes for signal conversion, error handling etc...  
except Exception as e:     # Catching any exceptions raised by the try block   
print ("Error in file {}, line {}: {}".format(inspect.getfile(e.__traceback__), inspect.getsourcelines(e.__traceback__)[1], str(e))) 
# Prints error message with source code location and exception details  
sys.exit() # Exit the program if there is an issue in file reading or parsing   
```    
This script reads a Verilog module from command line arguments, then uses PyVerilog to parse it into its abstract syntax tree (AST). The visitor class `SignalVisitor` should be implemented according to your specific requirements.  It's also worth noting that this is just an example and may need adjustments based on the actual use case of xform framework in a real project, as well as PyVerilog itself or its capabilities (e.g., handling more complex structures).
