Here is a Python module for your requirements using PyVerilog, re (for regex), argparse and unittest modules in combination to create debugging tools specific test cases as well as tool-specific tests scenarios like trace driver/load functionality or scountdriver scenario etc., along with comprehensive docstrings. 

```python
import pyverilog
from typing import List, Tuple
import re
import argparse
import unittest

class ExampleVisitor:
    def __init__(self):
        self._changes_made = []
    
    @property
    def changes(self) -> List[str]:  # type hint for return value is a list of strings. This makes it easier to read the test cases in unittest module later on when creating tests case methods like `test_signal` etc..  
        """Return all change made by visitor."""        
        changes = self._changes_made[:]  # copy internal state so that we can't modify its value from outside. This is a common Python idiom for this purpose, called "mutation" in functional programming terms (i.e., side effects are not allowed).  
        return changes   
    
    def visit(self, node):        
        if hasattr(node,'name') and 'signal_name' == str(node['name']):  # type hint for parameter is a Node object which should have attribute name. This makes it easier to read the test cases in unittest module later on when creating tests case methods like `test_signal` etc..  
            self._changes_made.append('Found signal')            
        
        if hasattr(node, 'children'):  # type hint for parameter is a Node object which should have attribute children (which are all nodes that node can reach). This makes it easier to read the test cases in unittest module later on when creating tests case methods like `test_signal` etc..  
            [self.visit(child) for child in list(node['children'])]  # recursive visit of children, type hint is a List[Node] which should be iterable (i.e., it can loop over all its elements). This makes it easier to read the test cases in unittest module later on when creating tests case methods like `test
