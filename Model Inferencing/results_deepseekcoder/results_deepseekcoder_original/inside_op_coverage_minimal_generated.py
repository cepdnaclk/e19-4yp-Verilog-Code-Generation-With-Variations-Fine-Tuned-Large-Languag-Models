Here is a Python module for your requirement using PyVerilog, argparse and re (for regex operations). This example assumes that you have already defined an AST parser in Verilog/SystemVerilog syntax which can be used to parse input files into Abstract Syntax Trees. 

```python
import pyverilog as pv
from verilog import ast, transforms
import re
import argparse

# PyVerilog AST parser for Verilog/SystemVerilog syntax definition can be defined here:
def parse_file(filename):  # Define your own parsing function based on the input file type. For example in this case we use pyverilog's built-in functions to load and analyze a verilog source code module (AST). This is just an abstract representation of how you can define such parser
    with open(filename, 'r') as f:  # Open the input file for reading. You should replace this part based on your actual use case or where it's coming from in real project scenario. For example if we are using pyverilog to parse a verilog source code module into an AST
        return pv.parse_file(f)  # Parse the file and generate Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). This is just abstract representation of how you can define such parser based on your actual use case or where it's coming from in real project scenario, for example using pyverilog to parse a verilog source code module into an AST
        
def visit_node(n):  # Define the visitor function. This is just abstract representation of how you can define such visitors based on your actual use case or where it's coming from in real project scenario, for example using pyverilog to traverse and modify nodes inside a verilog AST
    if type(n) == ast.Inside:  # If the node is an Inside operator (for instance), do something with n... For now we just print its name as placeholder but you should replace this part based on your actual use case or where it's coming from in real project scenario, for example using pyverilog to traverse and modify nodes inside a verilog AST
        return 'Inside: {}'.format(n.name)  # Return the result of visiting node n... For now we just print its name as placeholder but you should replace this part based on your actual use case or where it's coming from in real project scenario, for example using pyverilog to traverse and modify nodes inside a verilog AST
    else:  # If the current node is not an Inside operator (for instance), do something with n... For now we just print its name as placeholder but you should replace this part based on your actual use case or where it's coming from in real project scenario, for example using pyverilog to traverse and modify nodes inside a verilog AST
        return 'Node: {}'.format(n.name)  # Return the result of visiting node n... For now we just print its name as placeholder but you should replace this part based on your actual use case or where it's coming from in real project scenario, for example using pyverilog to traverse and modify nodes inside a verilog AST
        
def main():  # Define the command-line interface. This is just abstract representation of how you can define such interfaces based on your actual use case or where it's coming from in real project scenario, for example using pyverilog to parse input files into an AST and then traverse them with visitors
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="PyVerilog Coverage Testing Module")  # Create a command-line interface (argparser) based on your actual use case or where it's coming from in real project scenario, for example using pyverilog to parse input files into an AST and then traverse them with visitors
    parser.add_argument('files', metavar='FILES', nargs='+')  # Add arguments (input file names) based on your actual use case or where it's coming from in real project scenario, for example using pyverilog to parse input files into an AST and then traverse them with visitors
    args = parser.parse_args()  # Parse the command-line interface arguments (input file names) based on your actual use case or where it's coming from in real project scenario, for example using pyverilog to parse input files into an AST and then traverse them with visitors
    
    success = True  
        
    # Iterate over all the provided inputs (Verilog source code modules)... For now we just print its name as placeholder but you should replace this part based on your actual use case or where it's coming from in real project scenario, for example using pyverilog to parse input files into an AST and then traverse them with visitors
    # You can also add more code here if needed... For now we just print its name as placeholder but you should replace this part based on your actual use case or where it's coming from in real project scenario, for example using pyverilog to parse input files into an AST and then traverse them with visitors
        
    return success  # Return the result of executing main function... For now we just print its name as placeholder but you should replace this part based on your actual use case or where it's coming from in real project scenario, for example using pyverilog to parse input files into an AST and then traverse them with visitors
        
if __name__ == '__main__':  # Define the main function. This is just abstract representation of how you can define such functions based on your actual use case or where it's coming from in real project scenario, for example using pyverilog to parse input files into an AST and then traverse them with visitors
    import sys  
        
sys.exit(main())  # Call the main function (if any)... For now we just print its name as placeholder but you should replace this part based on your actual use case or where it's coming from in real project scenario, for example using pyverilog to parse input files into an AST and then traverse them with visitors
``` 
This is a very basic implementation of the requirement. You will need more complex code if you want coverage test cases generation based on random values or different scenarios (like boundary conditions). Also error handling, validation etc are not included in this example for simplicity but can be added as per your requirements using appropriate Python features like try/except blocks and return statements to handle errors appropriately within the main function.
