Here is a basic implementation of your requirements using Python and PyVerilog's API, assuming you have already installed pyverilog library in python environment (`pip install pyverilog-python3`). 
Please note that this code does not cover all the edge cases. You may need to adjust it according to specific use case or requirements of your project:
```Python
import argparse
from typing import List, Union
try: # PyVerilog's API is available in Python version >= 3.8 
    from pyverilog_python3 import VerilogModule as VG
except ImportError:  
     print("Please install the required library using pip.")
