Here is a Python module for your requirement using pyverilog, re (for regex), argparse and ast modules to parse Verilog files into an Abstract Syntax Tree(AST).  This will not be complete solution but it should give you some idea of how the code can look like. The transformation function `transform_wire` is implemented in a way that all 'reg' declarations are replaced by their corresponding wire counterparts, preserving bit widths and signal names:
```python
import pyverilog as pv  # PyVerilog library for parsing Verilog files into AST.
from ast import NodeTransformer   # Python built-in module to transform an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
import re    # Regular expressions in python, used here for replacing 'wire' with reg keyword and preserving signal names/bit widths 

class WireToRegVisitor(NodeTransformer):     // A visitor class that identifies target elements.  
        def visit_Assign(self, node: pv.ast.Module) -> None :    # Visit Assignment statement in the module (Verilog file). 
            if isinstance(node.targets[0],pv.ast.Id):     // If target of assignment is a variable id...  
                new_id = re.sub('wire', 'reg', node.targets[0].name)    // Replace wire with reg and preserve signal names/bit widths 
                 if not self._isValidReg(new_id):     /// Check for valid register name (not already in use).  
                     raise ValueError("Invalid Register Name: " + new_id )     
                node.targets[0].name = new_id    // Update variable id with the updated one 
            self.generic_visit(node)     /// Visit all other nodes recursively (if any).  
        def _isValidReg(self, name: str):       // Check if a register is already in use or not by verifying its existence using PyVerilog AST operations and return True/False. 
            # TODO : Implement this function to check for the existing registers (not implemented here as it would be too complex).  
             ...   
        def visit_FunctionDef(self, node: pv.ast.Module) -> None :     // Visit Function definition in module also if any... 
            self._isValidRegsInFunc = {}      /// A dictionary to store the valid registers used within a function (not implemented here).  
             ...    # Continue with other visit methods as per requirement, handle all nodes.      
        def transform_wire(self):     // Main transformation method that will replace 'reg' declarations by their corresponding wire counterparts... 
            self._isValidRegsInFunc = {}      /// Reset the dictionary to store valid registers used within a function (not implemented here).  
             ...    # Continue with other transformations, handle all nodes.      
        def run(self):     // Main driver method that will parse Verilog file and apply transformation... 
            parser = pv.Parser()      /// Create an instance of PyVerilog Parser to read the verilog source code from a string or filename (not implemented here).  
             ...    # Continue with other methods as per requirement, handle all nodes/errors in file and return True if successful else False...      
```  This is just one possible implementation. You would need more work on error handling for the PyVerilog library to parse Verilog files into an AST correctly (e.g., check whether a variable id exists before assigning it), handle all nodes in your file, and return True/False if successful or not respectively when running `run` method from driver code:
```python
def main():     // Main function that will parse Verilog source files... 
    parser = pv.Parser()      /// Create an instance of PyVerilog Parser to read the verilog file (not implemented here).  
             ...       # Continue with other methods as per requirement, handle all nodes/errors in file and return True if successful else False otherwise... 
```    This is a very basic example.

        parser = pv.Parser()       # Create an instance of PyVerilog Parser to read verilog file (not implemented here).  
             .....  // Continue with other methods as per requirement handling all nodes/errors in the Verilog source and return True if successful else False otherwise ...
