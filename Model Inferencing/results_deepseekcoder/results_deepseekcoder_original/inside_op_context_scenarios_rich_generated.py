Here is a Python module for your requirement using PyVerilog, re (for regex), argparse and ast modules from python standard library to parse Verilog/SystemVerilog ASTs in if statements or loops etc., along with error handling mechanisms as per the requirements mentioned. 

```python
import pyverilog
from collections import namedtuple
import re
import sys
import argparse
import ast

class ExampleVisitor(ast.NodeVisitor):   # Inheriting from Node Visitor in Python's AST module to perform transformations on the nodes of Verilog/SystemVerilog code
