Here is a basic implementation of your requirements using Python and PyVerilog (a python library for parsing Verilog). This example does not include error handling or validation, as these are more complex tasks that would require additional logic in each transformation function to handle them correctly. 

```python
import pyverilog
from xform import XFormBaseVisitor

class FixedArrayToDynamicMultiDimensionXForm(XFormBaseVisitor):
    def __init__(self, fixed_array: str) -> None:
        self._fixed_array = eval('[' + fixed_array.replace(" ", "], [")+ ']') # Convert string to list of lists for dynamic array syntax 
    
    @property
    def result(self): return pyverilog.parse((str)(pyverilog))  
      
class FixedArrayToDynamicMultiDimensionVisitor (FixedArrayToDynamicMultiDimensionXForm, XFormBaseVisitor.__visitor__): # Inherit visitor from xform base class 
    pass    
```     
This is a very basic implementation and does not handle all the requirements you mentioned. For example it doesn't preserve signal type or width in dynamic arrays but only handles fixed-size multi dimensional array conversion to be done by PyVerilog library which supports this functionality out of box, as well error handling for complex cases like uneven dimensions etc is left upto user who wants the codebase and logic.
  
To use it you would need a Verilog source file (or string) that needs transformation into dynamic multi-dimensional array syntax using PyVerilog library: 
```python   
verilog_source = """    
module test(input [31:0] inp, output reg out);  
always @* begin : main     
        if (inp[2])      
            out <= 8'hFF;         else         
                out <= {6{~inp}} ;  end   
endmodule """    
xform = FixedArrayToDynamicMultiDimensionXForm(verilog_source)   # Create instance of xformer with source code as input.     
print (pyverilog.parse((str)(PyVerilogVisitor().visit_(xform))).show())  # Print the transformed Verilog in PyVerilog's AST format for visualization and debugging purposes  ```    This is a very basic example of how you can use this library to convert fixed arrays into dynamic multi-dimensional ones.
