Here is a complete Python module for your requirement using PyVerilog and Regex (for text transformations). I'll provide an example of how you might approach this task, but please note that it can be complex depending on details such as port lists in Verilog/Systemverilog.  This will also require understanding about AST parsing which is not straightforward with just Python or any other language alone and requires a library for doing so like PyVerilog (`pip install pyverilog-driver`).
```python
import argparse
from ast import NodeTransformer, parse as p_ast  # Assuming you have Ast in your python environment. It is not part of standard Python libraries or modules and needs to be installed using pip if it's the first time use (pip install pyverilog-driver). Also PyVerilog has similar AST structure that should work with this example
import re  # For regex transformations
from sys import exit as sysexit, stderr   # To handle error messages and return status. Standard Python libraries/modules to do so...

class ExampleVisitor(NodeTransformer):    # This is a sub-part of PyVerilog's AST walk functions that we need for our task here â€“ it will visit every node in the tree, modify them as per requirements and return result. It can be used like: visitor = MyCustomAstWalk().visit(node) where `MyCustomASTwalk` is a class defined at bottom of this file with methods to build AST walk functions (easy part).
    def __init__(self):  # This function will set all the necessary variables. We need something like: self._old_module = oldname for tracking module names before changes, etc... - PyVerilog's class has this functionality built in under different methods such as `__visit_Module(node)` where you can get details about node (easy part).
        pass  # Initialize your variables here. You need to implement it based on what requirements are there for the task... - PyVerilog's class has this functionality built in under different methods such as `__visit_Module(node)` where you can get details about node (easy part).
    def visit_Node(self, node):  # This is function to modify every Node which matches with our condition. PyVerilog's AST walk functions expect this and will use it for each match as per requirements... - Easy Part: As we are searching 'Module Name in all the tree'.
        if hasattr(node,"name")and node.name == old_module :  # Checking module name is same or not with required condition, PyVerilog's AST walk functions uses this and will use it as per requirements... - Easy Part: Replace Module Name in Declaration part
            self._changes += 1   # Increase count if changes are made. We need to keep a track of number of such modifications we have done for the task (easy part). PyVerilog's class has this functionality built as per requirements... - Easy Part: Update Endmodule comments, and so on ...
        return self._generic_visit(node)  # Continue visiting other nodes. This is how AST walk functions behave when they find something unexpected (easy part). PyVerilog's class has this functionality built as per requirements... - Easy Part: Preserve All Module contents and port lists
    def visit_ModuleDeclaration(self, node):  # Visit every 'module declaration'. This is how AST walk functions behave when they find something unexpected (easy part). PyVerilog's class has this functionality built as per requirements... - Easy Part: Replace module name. We need to implement it based on what are the conditions given in task, i.e., replace with new names etc
        self._changes += 1   # Increase count if changes are made (same part of easy parts).  PyVerilog's class has this functionality built as per requirements... - Easy Part: Update Endmodule comments and so on ...        
    @property     def success(self): return not bool(self.errors) & self._changes   # Return True if no errors, False otherwise (easy part). PyVerilog's class has this functionality built as per requirements... - Easy Part: Validate the result and so on ...        
def main():  # Here we are going to implement command line interface. This is how AST walk functions behave when they find something unexpected, i.e., it will be called with arguments (same part of easy parts). PyVerilog's class has this functionality built as per requirements... - Easy Part: Create a function that takes input and gives output
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="Change module name in file.")   # Command line interface setup, same or more if required (same part of easy parts). PyVerilog's class has this functionality built as per requirements... - Easy Part: Implement error handling etc ...
