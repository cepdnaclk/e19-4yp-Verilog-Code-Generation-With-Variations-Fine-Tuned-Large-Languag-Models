Given your requirements, we can implement a Python module using PyVerilog and regex to perform transformations on Verilog/SystemVerilog files. The implementation will include error handling for invalid input or issues during file processing such as permissions errors etc., along with proper docstrings explaining the functionality of each part in our codebase:

```python
import pyverilog  # import PyVerilog library to parse and analyze ASTs (Abstract Syntax Trees)  
from re import sub, IGNORECASE    # Import regex for text transformations. 'sub' is used here instead of the built-in Python substitution function because we need case insensitive pattern matching  ('replacement', not just a string). This will be more efficient than using python str replace method
import argparse   # import argument parser to handle command line arguments in our main program   
from os.path import exists, isfile     # Import file and directory checking functions from the 'os' module which are used for different operations such as existence check of a path etc 

class ExampleVisitor(pyverilog.utils_pb2.__visitable__):   # Create visitor class that inherits pattern from existing xforms, using pyVerilog utils to visit nodes and perform transformations on them (using PyVerilog's built-in functionality) 
    def __init__(self, signal_name: str):     # Initialize our new attributes for the node visitor. 'signal name', list of changes made so far ('changes done'), whether a target was found or not flagged as True/False   (__visitable__) to be able at visit() method 
        self._node = None    # Declare private instance attribute '_Node' which will hold the current node being visited by this visitor. This is necessary because we can only access our own attributes from within a __method__(self, ...) decorated function (__visit__)  
         super().__init__()  # Call pyVerilog utils visit method using 'super', Pyverilgo's built-in functionality to perform transformations on the current node being visited by this visitor. We need it because we want every operation performed here, be a part of our new class (ExampleVisitor), and accessible within all __visit__() methods  
        self._changes_made = []  # Declare private instance attribute '_Changes made', list to hold any changes or updates that will occur during the visit process. Initialize it with an empty array in this case   
         self.__signalName  = signal_name     # Define a __variable__ 'Signal Name' which is used for target element identification (in our visitor class). It can only be accessed within its own method, not directly accessible from outside   ,  using double underscores '_ExampleVisitor'. This way we prevent direct access and usage of the variable in any other parts or methods.
        self.__signalFound = False    # Declare private instance attribute 'Signal Found', flag that indicates whether a target was found during visit process (Initialize it with false)  , using double underscores '_ExampleVisitor'.   This way we prevent direct access and usage of the variable in any other parts or methods.
        self._targetNode = None    # Declare private instance attribute 'Target Node', will hold target node that is being visited by this visitor, initialized to none at first  , using double underscores '_ExampleVisitor'.   This way we prevent direct access and usage of the variable in any other parts or methods.
         self._content = None    # Declare private instance attribute 'Content', will hold content from file (initialize with null), used for regex transformations, initialized to none at first  , using double underscores '_ExampleVisitor'.   This way we prevent direct access and usage of the variable in any other parts or methods.
         self._portLists = None    # Declare private instance attribute 'Port Lists', will hold port lists from file (initialize with null), used for replacing module name, initialized to none at first  , using double underscores '_ExampleVisitor'.   This way we prevent direct access and usage of the variable in any other parts or methods.
         self._newContent = None    # Declare private instance attribute 'New Content', will hold content after transformations (initialize with null), used for writing back to file, initialized to none at first  , using double underscores '_ExampleVisitor'.   This way we prevent direct access and usage of the variable in any other parts or methods.
         
    def visit_Node(self):     # Define a method 'visit' that will be called for each node visited by this visitor, performing necessary operations on it (using pyVerilog utils).  This is where we define what happens at every point during the visiting process   , using double underscores '_ExampleVisitor'.
        if self._node:     # If a target has been found previously...    . Using 'if' here to ensure that only one signal name can be targeted and replaced. It does not work with multiple targets as we are looking for cases where all nodes will have the same module declaration (with different names).  
            if isinstance(self._node, pyverilog.ast_pb2.__decl__):     # If current node type's name matches our target...    . We only want to handle declarations here and not other types of AST nodes such as functions or ports etc., so it uses 'is instance'.
                for item in self._node.list:  # For each declaration we found, perform the following operations   ...      , using double underscores '_ExampleVisitor' at _Node method to access these methods within our visitor class (pyVerilog utils) . This is where all changes will be made and updates added into list of 'changes done'.
                    if hasattr(item, "name") and item.name == self.__signalName:     # If the name in declaration matches with target signal...    ... we perform necessary operations here (replace module names).  We use Python's built-in functionality to check for attributes on an object like 'has attr', then access their values using dot notation '.
                        self.Signal_Found = True   # Set flag '_signal found' as true, indicating that a target has been identified during visit process .      .....    This line can only be reached if previous conditions are met and thus all operations performed inside this method will have effects on 'changes done', list of changes made so far.
                         self._Changes_made += [f"Found {self.__signalName}"]  # Append the change to our '_Change Done' array (list) . This line can only be reached if all previous conditions are met and thus we will have 'changes done', list of changes made so far.
                         self._content = sub(r'(?i)'+self.__signalName + r'.*$','#\1_ChangedByPyVerilog' ,  # Perform the regex substitution to replace module name with '_changed by pyverilgo.' in content . This line can only be reached if previous conditions are met and thus we will have 'content', list of changes made so far.
                          self._portLists = [x for x in self.__ports__ ]  # Assign port lists from _node to '_Port Lists' , using double underscores '_ExampleVisitor'. This line can only be reached if previous conditions are met and thus we will have 'changes done', list of changes made so far.
                           return True    # After all operations, returning true as a signal that transformation has been completed successfully .   .....      All lines in this method should end with an returns statement to make sure our visitor class is correctly implemented  (__visit__) for PyVerilog ASTs and it can be used by the xform framework.
                self._targetNode = None    # If we are not replacing target, set '_Target Node' as none at first . This line should only reach if previous conditions were met but this case was unreachable code due to current state of our visitor class (pyVerilog utils).   .....      All lines in the method 'visit_Node()' are not indented and hence it is considered a part of pyverilgo.utils functionality, which should be implemented by all users who want this visibility module for PyVerilog AST visitors .
        self._node = None    # After visiting an individual node (done in visit method), setting '_Node' as none at first  , using double underscores '_ExampleVisitor'.   This line can only reach if previous conditions are met and thus we will have 'changes done', list of changes made so far.
        self._content = content    # Assign original file contents to our private attribute _Content . All lines in this method should end with a return statement (either True or False) indicating whether the process completed successfully  , using double underscores '_ExampleVisitor'.   This line can only reach if previous conditions are met and thus we will have 'changes done', list of changes made so far.
        self._portLists = [x for x in node_utils.__ports__ ]    # Assign port lists from the file to our private attribute '_Port Lists' . This line can only reach if previous conditions are met and thus we will have 'changes done', list of changes made so far.
