Here's a basic example of how you could structure your Python module to meet these requirements using PyVerilog for parsing and visitors (which are essentially classes that process nodes in an AST) as part of XForm Framework approach, along with argparse handling the command-line interface.  This is just pseudo code since there's no actual implementation available but it should give you a good starting point to work from:
```python
# Required Libraries/Modules Importation Section  
import pyverilog as pv # PyVerilog module providing Python bindings for Verilog and VHDL code generation. 
from visitor import Visitor    # Existing xform framework's customised visitors (visitors based on the AST)
# Importing re to handle regular expressions in python string manipulation methods  
import re                  
    
class MyVisitor(Visitor):      # Customized Visitorers which inherit from XForm Framework pattern 
    pass                     # You'll need a custom implementation here. This is just basic skeleton code for your reference .      
                                                      
def start_visit(node, visitor:MyVisitor)->bool :     # Starts visit method to traverse the AST tree     
   if not node or "someCondition" in re.findall('<conditionInNodeTypeHere', str(type(node))):  return False    # Condition should be replaced by actual condition based on your requirements       
                                                                                                         
   visitor._handle_mda = lambda m: visit (isinstance, [m]) if not issubclass else _handler.setdefault(_makekey([str(id)]), []).append((visit,(lambda sf=self ,*args : callfn(*sf .split('.' ), * args )) )
   return True                                     # Calling visit method on child nodes and handling them appropriately     
    
def main():       // Command-line Interface section    defs, etc. are here to handle command line arguments for now...       
# argparse setup ...                                                 pass         
if __name__ == '__main__': 
   parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Process some integers.')           # Setup the argument parsing section     return main()      // Main function of your module, you can call it here if needed...    defs         pass       endif         ^Cdef           $endfile        exit!
```  This is a very basic example and will not work as expected until more detailed requirements are understood. You'll need to define the `MyVisitor` class that inherits from Visitors, implement all methods required by PyVerilog AST visitor pattern (e.g., visit_ArrayExp for arrays), handle command line arguments etc.. And also complete error handling and validation according your requirements based on these guidelines: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern
