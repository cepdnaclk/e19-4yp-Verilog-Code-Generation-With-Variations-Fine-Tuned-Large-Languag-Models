Sure, I can provide a basic skeleton of how you might structure your Python module to accomplish this task using PyVerilog for parsing and analysis ASTs, regex for text transformations, error handling etc.:

```python
import pyverilog as pv  # import the parser library from 'pyverilog' package. You may need to install it via pip: `pip install pyverilog` if not installed already. PyVerilog is a Python module that can parse and analyze Verilog code for its Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs).
import re  # Import the regular expression library in python which we will use herefor pattern matching operation on strings. For example, searching or replacing text with regex patterns etc..
from argparse import ArgumentParser  # This is a module to handle command line arguments so you can call your program from terminal like: `python filename.py inputfile output_prefix` where 'input' and 'output' are file names which should be processed by the script, while "out\_pref" will give an option for pre-processing (if necessary).
import os  # Import OS module to get rid of absolute paths/URLs in filenames. For example: `os.path.basename('/home//user@host:/verilog')` would return just 'file' not '/home/.bash_history'. You can use it for error handling and logging purposes as well or simply ignore this if you do not need such functionalities within your module
import sys  # Import the system library to get rid of `py verilog: command not found...` message. In case pyverilod is missing, Python will throw an exception which we can catch by using try-catch block in our code and print a useful error Message or stop execution.. For example with this line : sys.exit("PyVerilow module couldnot be imported.")
import xform  # Assuming you have already created your own `xtransform` package where it contains the visitor class to handle AST transformations, make sure import is correct here! This should include all necessary modules and classes for handling this task which are needed. Make a PR if required with PyVerilog's documentation
    
def main():  # Main function that will contain your command-line interface where you can call the python file via terminal or use scripts as input/output files etc.. Here it should be called after parsing all arguments from argparse module. It is recommended to put this code into a separate Python File and then import only required modules for better clarity
    pass  # Add your implementation here, maybe you would call other functions like xform_visitor or error handling function inside main() depending on requirement    
        
if __name__ == '__main__':  
      parser = ArgumentParser(description="Process Verilog files")  # create a command line interface for the program. PyVerilod's arguments will be added here as well using argparse module      
                              args, unknown_args =  pv .argparser().parse()    # parse all given cmdline options to `vars` object inside main function     
                                                      ...  continue from where you left off if required.   Finally call your implemented 'main' method with provided arguments and exit status of the script based on what it returns (0 means success, anything else is error).     sys .exit(args)    # This will invoke pyverilod command line interface which PyVerilog can process
``` 
This code gives a basic idea about how your Python module should look. You may need to modify or extend this according to the exact requirements of your project and also add necessary error handling, logging etc.. depending on what you want in it for actual use case scenarios/projects . It'll be helpful if someone can provide more specific details as per requirement about how exactly pyverilod should behave when errors occur.
