Here's a basic example of how you could structure your Python module to accomplish this task using PyVerilog and argparse for CLI interaction, although it is important that pyverilog does not handle debugging or tool-specific tests in its own modules (as the requirements are pretty complex). 

```python
import sys
from functools import reduce
sys.path.insert(1,'/usr/local/lib') # assuming you have added a 'xform' folder to your PYTHONPATH or similar setup for pyverilog and argparse modules  
    
try: 
    from PyVerilogParser import VerilogFile as vgf, ParseError       
except ImportError as e:      # handle error when the user has not installed libxml2 (pylibxslt) or similar module to parse .v files.  
     print(e,"\nPlease install a parser library that supports Verilog.") 
    sys.exit()                  # exit program if we can't import 'PyVerilogParser'.     
from xform_visitor import XFormVisitor            
import argparse        
          
def main():                     
   """Main function"""         
    
 parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="This is a Pyverig module for verilog transformations")    # Create an argument parser 
      
parser.add_argument('-f', '--file', required=True, help='Verilog file to be parsed')  
args =  vars(parser.parse_args())                      # get arguments from arg parse     
    
try:                                                    # try parsing .v files with Pyverig   
  ast = next((x for x in map(lambda f : list(map(str, filter(None , [s for s in vgf.parse_file('../' + args['file']))])) if isinstance (next ((filter (lambdasort by length: lambda a b:(len(a)> len(b)), x)))), Exception )  
except StopIteration as e : print ('The file could not be parsed', str(e)); sys.exit() # handle exception   
    
ast = reduce((lambda f, g: list (map ((list , map )) + [f]*g ), ast)        if isinstance('_xform__' in x else False for ysftpintre 'y')   false or True          except Exception as e : print ('There was an error processing the file', str(e)); sys.exit() # handle exception   
     try:                                                     assert (isinstance  not issubclass )       if any([x in dir(__builtins__).keys () for x in ['list','dict']]) else True   false or False, TypeError as e : print('Type error found', str(e))                sys.exit() # handle type errors   
except Exception: pass                                  try:  from argparse import Namespace      except ImportError as ioe:     raise ValueError("Import Error occurred" +str (ioe));   else:#else statement is not required now, but it's still there for completeness.        finally : print ("End of Program")
```         # end main function and command-line interface  }}}         ```    """       A complete set should be written here to cover all the requirements mentioned above... However this will require a lot more work than can actually fit into one script due to complexity involved. It's beyond scope for such as in simple scripts, but hopefully it gives you an idea of how your Python module would look like and where some parts are going (i.e., structure).
