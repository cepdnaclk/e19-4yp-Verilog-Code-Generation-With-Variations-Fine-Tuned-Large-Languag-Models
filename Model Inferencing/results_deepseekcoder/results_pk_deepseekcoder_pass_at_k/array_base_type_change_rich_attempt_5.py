In order to perform this task, we will need a couple of modules in Python that are not built into PyVerilog or standard library (re and argparse), but which can be easily added by importing them using pip install as follows: 
- `pyverilog` for parsing Verilog/SystemVerilog code. You may need to use an alternative method if you want this functionality in a standalone module, such as lxml or ast (Python's builtin AST). The argparse can be used when invoking the script from command line arguments like input file and output directory etc
- `ast` is Pythonâ€™s standard library for working with abstract syntax trees. We will use it to parse Verilog/SystemVerilog code into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) which we'll then traverse using our visitor pattern in order not only find array declarations but also replace their base types and handle width specifications appropriately
- `re` for performing regular expressions on the text string content of a file. 
    We will use it to substitute all occurances of an old type with new one, effectively changing them into equivalent Verilog/SystemVerilog code structures that are compatible between different languages in our case Python and C++ (or vice versa). This is done by searching for the target signal name inside each file content.
- `os` to handle I/O operations like creating or writing files, etc.,  if required during execution of transformation module itself can be handled using this as well considering use cases where we need a way out from it (like deleting output directories after successful completion). This is not built into Python but standard library in python
- `copy` to copy the input file and its contents over to new locations for writing back changes.  Again, if these operations are handled inside our script then this can be considered as external module or part of it (depending on use case) . But argparse should handle most cases where we would need a way out from transformation process itself
- `numpy` and/or pandas: If you want to support changing array dimensions, signal names etc. Can also take care this in Python as well by using numpy or dataframe which can be used for manipulating arrays with their dimension changes directly (if required). This is not built into python but standard library
- `pdb` and/or other debuggers: If any part of the transformation process fails, we may want to stop execution at that point so this could also take care in case if our script gets interrupted by some error. Can be handled using pdb or similar as well for interactive troubleshooting  (depends on use cases)
- `shutil`: Handle I/O operations like deleting directories etc., which are built into Python but not standard library and can't handle delete operation out from script itself, just argparse could take care of this. This is also needed if we need to leave a directory after successful transformation at some point 
- `json` for handling JSON input/output as it may be necessary in dealing with array dimensions etc., If not used then can use other methods or replace by pandas and numpy where required but will add complexity upfront. This is also built into Python, standard library method so no need to import here 
- `sys` for capturing command line arguments if needed during script execution itself when invoking from terminal/command prompt etc., Can handle this in argparse as well or using sys module directly where necessary but not recommended since we are dealing with CLI which can't be controlled through Python. It is better to use os and re modules for such cases
- `unittest`: For unit testing if required, built into python standard library so no need of external package like unittests or pytest etc., Can handle this in case where we have written our visitor pattern tests itself (based on requirement)  . But not as part the argparse usage but when needed.
- `logging`: If any error/exception happens during execution, then logging can be used to log that into a file for debugging purpose or even sending it over mail if required in future based upon use case and built into python standard library so no need of external module like streamlit etc.,  Can handle this.
- `xml`: Used when an alternative AST parser is needed, such as lxml from the Python Standard Library's xml/etree (which can be used to parse a XML file in conjunction with ast) or if required then other alternatives could include ElementTree for simpler use cases and built into python standard library.
- `csv`: If CSV data needs handling this module is useful, it provides functions like DictReader that are handy when dealing arrays of objects/records (like pandas does). It's a part from the Python Standard Library but can be imported as an external package if required or added in argparse and used directly.
- `pandas`: If dataframes with dimensions need handling, then this is useful which would help to manipulate these into Verilog/SystemVerilog compatible code structures (like changing base types). This module can be imported as an external package if required or added in argparse and used directly.
- `matplotlib`: For plotting graphs when needed for visualization, it's useful but not built intopython standard library so we will use third party libraries to add this functionality (like seaborn). This module can be imported as an external package if required or added in argparse and used directly.
- `plotly`: For more complex data analysis/visualization, it's useful but not built into python standard library so we will use third party libraries to add this functionality (like plotly) . This module can be imported as an external package if required or added in argparse and used directly.
