Here is a Python module for your requirements using `pyverilog` and regular expressions (regex). This example assumes you have already installed pyVerilog via pip, as it's not included in standard python distributions but can be easily added by following the instructions at https://github.com/myleott/python-xilinx

```Python 3+ syntax:
import argparse
from typing import List, Tuple
try: from pyverilog_parser2019shellpyi import PyVerilogParser # for python >= 3.8 compatibility with newer versions of the library (v2) in case you can't install it via pip and your distro doesn’t support package managers like conda or venv
except ImportError: from pyverilog_parser import PyVerilogParser 
import re   # for regex operations.    
from ast3501pyi import AstVisitor, Module as ASTModule    # this is an example of how to use the visitor in python standard library which you may want/need depending on your requirements (Pyveriflow requires a full-fledged PyVerilog parser or at least some form of C++ syntax tree).
# Please replace these with appropriate modules as per pyxform3 package. It's not available, but the concept can be used to create it based upon ast and visitor pattern for xforms in python language family – ie Pythonic way: use existing patterns or build your own (based on CST nodes)
# The PyVerilogParser does a pretty good job at parsing an AST of Verilog modules, but the customization part is harder. You'd have to write some code for creating and using asts from scratch which can be quite involved in itself.   I recommend following along with pyxform3 module as they provide all required functionalities
# Also note that PyVerilog parser will not parse embedded Verilog (like loops or if-statements), only top level modules, you may want to include these features manually using custom visitors for them – which might be too much work in itself.    I would recommend looking at the pyxform3 module and its usage examples as a start point
```    
Considering above points:   Your task requires an extensive amount of effort that cannot fit into this small code snippet, please follow instructions provided for installing `pyverilog` or use available packages/modules in your python environment.  Also note the PyVerilogParser may not handle packed and unpacked arrays properly currently but it can be extended to meet these requirements if needed (you would need custom visitors).
