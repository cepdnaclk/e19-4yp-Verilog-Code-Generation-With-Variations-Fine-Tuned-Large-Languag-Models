Here is a simplified version of how you could structure your Python module to accomplish this task using PyVerilog and argparse for CLI, re (for regular expressions) modules if needed in case there are multiple arrays declarations or different key types support etc.: 

```python
import pyverilog as pv
from collections import defaultdict    # To handle associative array dimensions.  
                                      # We use a dictionary for each dimension to map keys and values across them later on if needed by the xform function itself    
                                                                          
class XFormVisitor(pv.XFormBase):      # Define your visitor class here  inheriting from pv's base transformer which you can modify as per requirement   
                                         
                                 def visit_arraydeclaration_(self, node: pv.ArrayDeclaration) -> bool :   // Implement the actual visiting function by using PyVerilog AST nodes to identify and transform your target elements  # The returning value indicates if transformation was successful or not    
                                                                                   
def main():                            # Define a Main Function for CLI interface here   
                                           argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Convert Arrays To Associative Multi-Dimensional Array')      // Create an Argument Parser to handle user input  
                                          parse = parser.add_argument('verilogfile', type=str, help="Input Verilog file")     // Adding argument for verilog files  # Parse the CLI arguments   
                                                                          
if __name__ == "__main__":       // Call Main Function  
                                 main()     
```                             
This is a basic outline and may need adjustments as per your specific requirements. The PyVerilog library's AST nodes can be used to identify the target elements (in this case, array declarations) for transformation in Verilog codebase which also provides methods like `get_identifier`(returns identifier name), etc., You have more details on how you should define your visitor class and its visiting function.
