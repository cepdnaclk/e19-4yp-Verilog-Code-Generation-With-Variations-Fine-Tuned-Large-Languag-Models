Here's a simple implementation of your requirements using Python and PyVerilog, assuming that you have already implemented an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parser in another part of your system or library for parsing Verilog source files into AST nodes which can be traversed by visitors. This is also assumed to exist:

```python
import pyverilog as pv
from collections import defaultdict  # Used when you want a dictionary with defaults and support int keys, etc., unlike dict in Python3+ using None for non-existing items which makes the code easier but not necessary. The requirement here is to have key types that can be compared (string) so this functionality would also make sense unless we define our own data type compatible with it
import re  # For regex operations, you could use a library like `regex` instead of built-in Python libraries if needed for more complex patterns e.g., lookaheads or backreferences etc. PyVerilog does not support Regex out the box but can be used through pv_re module
import argparse  # For command line parsing, you could use a library like `argparse` to build an interactive menu from commands if needed for more complex patterns e.g., mutiple file operations etc or allow user input as well using getopt() function in Python3+ (requires python version > 2)
import sys  # For error handling and system exit, it's very important not just print statements but also use these functions to handle errors gracefully such that if an exception occurs then the program can terminate or continue running. This is a standard way of using Python for this purpose (like C++/Java)
import ast  # For AST related operations e,g., parsing Verilog files into Abstract Syntax Tree nodes which could be traversed by visitors we are going to use in our code as it simplifies the process further. It's part of Python Standard Library and provides an interface for creating abstract syntax trees (AST)
import inspect  # For checking if a function is called from inside another, this can help us find where things like array conversion should happen e.g., not all functions are being used in our codebase but only through visitors so we need to use it here as well otherwise the visitor will never be instantiated and thus would always fail when trying to convert an item
import itertools  # For generating combinations of keys (when converting arrays into associative multi-dimensional array) if not already included by default. This is used because Python's built in dictionary type does support only single key but we need the capability for multiple keys e,g., list or tuple etc to convert an item
from xform import XForm  # Your existing 'xform framework', this should be a python module that includes your custom transformations and visitors. This is used as parent class of all our transformation classes in my code below: TransformationVisitor(XForm) (also known nowadays under PyVerilog's new name pyverilog_visitors).
