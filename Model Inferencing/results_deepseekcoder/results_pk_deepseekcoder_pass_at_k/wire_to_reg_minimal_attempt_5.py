Sure! Here is a basic implementation of your request using Python and pyverilog library for Verilog parsing, argparse to handle CLI inputs etc.: 
```python
import os
from collections import namedtuple
import re
try: # PyVerilog requires setuptools or distutils.core module in python package (like pyyaml) not pip installed directly from source files so trying the following method first before failing to install via pyverilog and argparse  if it's fails then try installing using above line of code
    import yaml # used for parsing configuration file, you might need to add more dependencies in setup.py or use `pip` with command like: pip install -r requirements_dev.txt --no-cache-dir (if exists) and rename it into pyverilog/requirements_dev.txt if doesn't exist
except ImportError as e:  # pragma: no cover; setuptools requirement not satisfied, fallback to distutils approach using pip install via command line or use above imports lines instead of the below ones then fail with appropriate message in case it fails due any other reason too. (`pip` installed directly from source files)
    try: # trying if yaml module is available else installing setuptools and pyyaml which are required for parsing configuration file using pip install command line  or use above imports lines instead of the below ones then fail with appropriate message in case it fails due any other reason too. (`pip` installed directly from source files)
        # if PyVerilog module is not available, fallback to distutils approach: add `pyverilog=yaml; python_version<"3": import io` at the top of your setup file then use pip install -r requirements.txt --no-cache-dir command line or comment out this section
        pass  # pragma: no cover (fallback to distutils approach using yaml module via PyVerilog's requirement and argparse)
    else:    
      raise e   # if `yaml` is not available, throw error. It will be caught at setup time by pyverilog or pip install command line then fail with appropriate message in case it fails due any other reason too (fallback to distutils approach using PyVerilog's requirement and argparse)
    
from xform import XFormBase  # Replace `xform` accordingly. The module that implements the visitor pattern is assumed already present as per your request for transformation of wire variables into reg vars in Verilog/Systemverilog codebase but if it's not there, please provide a suitable implementation
import argparse   # Argument parsing library  to handle command line inputs. Assuming you have one or more CLI args as per your requirement otherwise add `parser=None` at the end of function call in main() method like: parser = None (default value) if not present then fail with appropriate message
import pyverilog   # PyVerilog module which is used for parsing and analyzing Verilog codebase, you can use pip install command line or just import from the source file. If it's already installed via setuptools/distutils in python package installation method then `pass` at beginning of this section otherwise comment out with below lines: pass
```  (your class name) and fill up their details according to your requirement, ie., XFormBase should be replaced by the appropriate module implementing visitor pattern. argparse is used for handling command line arguments if any such are required else it can stay as `None` or comment out at end of function call in main().
