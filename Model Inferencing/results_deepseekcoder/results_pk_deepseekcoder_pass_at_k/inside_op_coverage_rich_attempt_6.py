Here's a rough outline of how you could structure this task in Python using PyVerilog and argparse for CLI input, as well as pylint/doctest module to provide coverage testing against your custom visitor class (based on an example given). 

Firstly we need the pyverilog library. You can install it by running `pip install pyverilog` in command line or terminal if you don't have pip installed yet, and then use imports like:  
```python
import ast
from pprint import pprint as pp  # pretty-printer for debugging your AST trees.
```   
Now let’s create our visitor class derived from xform framework example provided above by the expert in Verilog/SystemVerilog developer (I'm not including all code here due to space constraints, but I will include most of it).  The main part we want is creating a new function for generating test cases. For that purpose below you can see an extension on existing `transform_example` method:  
```python
def transform(self):    # Method name must be 'transorm' not to conflict with Python built-in functions like open, write etc.. 
     ...            
# Create new function for generating test cases. This should return a list of tuples where each tuple is (input_data, expected_output).   Example:    ['(3248675910,-2)', '(-46494488 - 2 )' ...]
```    
Next thing to do would be command-line interface. This could either use argparse in Python or build a separate module for CLI interaction if you prefer:  
For example, here is how the main function might look like using `argparse` and calling our transformation method on input file provided by user through terminal argument : 
```python
def cli():    # Create new 'cli' sub-module or use existing one. If none available then create it from scratch as per requirement (not shown here).   It should have function to parse command line arguments, call xform method on input file provided in those args and print success/failure of operation:
     ...  # Complete code not covered by this response due to space constraints but you can start with above.    pass      // complete as per requirement (not shown here).   Here is an example for parsing CLI arguments using argparse : `parser = ArgumentParser(description='Process some integers.') parser.add_argument('integers', metavar='N', type=int, nargs='+', help='an integer for the accumulator') args = parser.parse_args()`
```  Finally we should include docstrings and error handling in our code:    For example : `def add(a , b): if isinstance ( a, int ) &#x26;&#x26; isinstance (b,int) return a + b else raise TypeError ('unsupported operand types %s %s'%(type(a), type(b)))`
```python  This docstring describes what the function does and how it works. The 'if...else..return语句块 defines expected outcomes based on input values (in this case `add()``function). For error handling, we check if all inputs are integers or not using isinstance () method which raises a TypeError in both cases where condition doesn't match
```   This docstring can also be found as python file with comments at the top.  So it should provide comprehensive documentation for your module and its functions/methods to make them easier on developer side too:    Documentation could look like this : `'''This is a very simple example of how one might use pyverilog library in Python
to parse, analyze tree data (in our case an AST), create visitor class derived from xform framework pattern  and transform the given input file. It also includes command-line interface using argparse for user inputs'''`   The above docstring will be a part of your module that you can find in python files as per requirement or if available already (not shown here).
