Here's a simplified version of how you could structure such module in Python, using pyverilog for parsing and ast manipulation tasks as well as argparse to handle command line arguments within your program execution flow (you may need more sophisticated handling than this): 
```python
import re
from abc import ABCMeta, abstractmethod
# Import all necessary modules from PyVerilog library here. For example: pyverilog.ast_nodes as vn; ... etc...  
                                                  # The point is to add the correct namespace for your module's classes and functions 
                            
class XForm(metaclass=ABCMeta):                                     # Defines a base class with abstract methods (as required by Python Abstract Base Classes)    
    @abstractmethod                                        
    def transform_xform(self, node: vn.ModuleDecl) -> bool : pass   # Define an interface for child classes to implement this method 
                                                  # The purpose is so you can't instantiate a base class and expect any of its methods defined here in the future    
                            
class MyXForm(XForm):                                        # Defines your specific transformation module. Inherits from Xform   
   def transform_xform(self, node: vn.ModuleDecl) -> bool : 
       pass                                                  # You'll implement this method here with the logic of you want to apply    
                                          # For example if x or z values were passed as command line argument then use them in your transformation process  
                            
def main():                                           
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()                           
                                            
parser.add_argument('x', type=int, help='Input for X')          # Command-line arguments are added here 
                                         
args = vars(parser.parse_args())                                                    # The parsed command line argument is stored in args dictionary  
                                                                    
if __name__ == '__main__':                                        
    xform  = MyXForm()                                           
                              
def test():                                            
# You should have tests for all the cases mentioned above here, you may use assert statements or similar to check your results.  For example:                 # Tests will be added in this section as well  
                                                                            pass    
```         
This is a basic skeleton of how such module can start with pyverilog parsing and AST traversal while accepting command line arguments for transformation specifics using argparse library.  The `argparse` function allows users to specify options via the terminal/command-line interface, which are then parsed into Python datatypes (here int).
In order to integrate this module with xform framework you would need a deep understanding of pyverilog's AST and argparsing. Also note that error handling for command line arguments is not included in the provided code but it should be added as per your requirement, e.g., if invalid types/values are passed or no values were given etc..
