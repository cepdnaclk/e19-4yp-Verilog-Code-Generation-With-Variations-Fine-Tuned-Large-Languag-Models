Here is a Python module for your requirements using `pyverilog` and regular expressions (regex). This example assumes you have already installed pyVerilog via pip, which allows parsing of Verilog files into an Abstract Syntax Tree that can be traversed with visitors/visitors. 

```python
import argparse
from ast import NodeTransformer, parse
from re import search as regex_search
try: from verilog_ast import ModuleNode   # PyVerilog's version of the AST library used in this example; replace with your actual lib if necessary. 
except ImportError: pass                  # If you don’t have a Python Verilog parser, use an equivalent (e.g., PLY or antlr4-python) here instead to parse files and build up the AST manually for simplicity's sake in this example script; replace with your actual lib if necessary
import sys   # For command line arguments – add more as needed based on what you want from users, e.g., -b (bit), etc... 
from typing import List    # Enable type checking and autocomplete features for better Pythonic style code in future versions of the language with types specified here via pyverilog's AST nodes structure is assumed to be compatible; if not you may need another lib. For example, `ast` contains more specific Node classes (e.g., AssignNode) that can exist within a Module or Array declaration
# You might also want an exception handler for things like failed importing necessary libraries and so on…  as needed based upon use case of your script; replace with suitable exceptions handling in this example code snippet too...  
    
def find_and_replace(ast: 'ModuleNode', oldtype, newbase):    # Defines the target elements’ finding method to be used later by a visitor. Replace `'xform` and its children calls according on your requirement (e.g., xfm that changes array base type).
     for child in ast.children:  # For each sub-node within AST...  
         if isinstance(child, 'ArrayDecalNode') :    # If the node contains an Array Deceleration….. then do following steps according to requirement; replace `bit` and others with your actual types you want it done for. Then continue as per requirements (e.g., change base type by changing its name).
             if oldtype in child.children:    # If the node contains an Array Declaration...   …then do following steps according to requirement; replace `bit` and others with your actual types you want it done for, then continue as per requirements (e.g., change base type by changing its name).
                 if isinstance(child['base'], 'NameNode') :    # If the Array Declaration contains a Base Type…..   ……then replace `bit` and others with your actual types you want it done for, then continue as per requirements (e.g., change base type by changing its name).
                     child['base'].name = newbase     # Replace oldtype’s Array Deceleration Name to New Base Type in AST here...  Then do the rest steps according requirement of your task; replace bit, etc with actual types you want it done for.   After all modifications are completed from above step then return True else False
                     break    # Break out loop once replacement is complete (i.e., Array Declaration has been replaced). You can continue this in other lines too based on requirement…..  replace `bit` and others with your actual types you want it done for, etc...   After all nodes have being processed by visitor then return True else False
     if not any(isinstance(child, oldtype)for child in ast.children):    # If no Array Deceleration that matches the target type exists…..  Return false; otherwise continue as per requirements (e.g., change base types).   replace `bit` and others with your actual types you want it done for
     return False       # No changes were made, so this node is not a match any more -> no further processing needed here because the AST has been fully traversed – Return false if none of above conditions are fulfilled.   replace `bit` and others with your actual types you want it done for
     return True        # If we get to end without returning False, then all changes were made successfully -> no further processing needed here because the AST has been fully traversed – Return true if none of above conditions are fulfilled.   replace `bit` and others with your actual types you want it done for
