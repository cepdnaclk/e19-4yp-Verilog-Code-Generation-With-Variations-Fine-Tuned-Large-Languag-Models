Here is a basic implementation of your requirement using Python and pyverilog library for parsing Verilog syntax trees, re module to use regular expressions in transformations etc.: 
```python
import argparse
from typing import List, Dict
try: from verilog_parser.astnodes import *
except ImportError as e1 : try: from pyverilog2019xformtools3dsprfgenlibpythontestmodulejsonpyserializationxmlserializerpythoncppbackendutilsmemorymanagementutilsconversionsbitmanipulations importerror re, sys imports.from_imported(XForm): pass
except ImportError as e2:  # pyverilog library not found or version is incorrect; fall back to default method (which doesn't support renaming signals in Verilog)   try/ except block will be added below with the correct imports and methods. Also, this part needs more work for a complete implementation
    sys.exit('Error: pyverilog library not found or version is incorrect.'+str(e2))  # fall back to default method (which doesn't support renaming signals in Verilog)   try/ except block will be added below with the correct imports and methods. Also, this part needs more work for a complete implementation
     pass#fallbackmethod not implemented yet       sys.exit('Error: FallBackMethodNotImplemented')  # fall back to default method (which doesn't support renaming signals in Verilog)   try/ except block will be added below with the correct imports and methods.
