Here is a Python module for your requirement using PyVerilog and re (regular expression operations). This assumes that you have pyverilog installed in python environment which can parse Verilog files into Abstract Syntax Tree(AST) to identify array declarations, replace the base type of an element by changing it with desired one.
```python 
import argparse   # for command-line interface   
from ast import NodeVisitor     # Python's built in AST module which can be used here as a visitor class will visit every node and perform relevant operations on them based upon their types (like array, logic etc).         
try:        from pyverilog.ast_parser  import PyVerilogParser    except ImportError : pass     # trying to load ast parser module in case it is not installed yet   // If you have a local copy of Verilog files then no need for this line, just remove the try/except block
import re        # regular expression operations (re.sub)  if required by your requirement    . Here we are assuming that all array declarations and their widths will be replaced with specific string in output file   //If you want to keep dimensions while replacing base type then this line needs modification accordingly as per requirements    
      
class ArrayVisitor(NodeVisitor):      # visitor class for identifying nodes based on the requirement.    Inheriting from Node Visitor so that it can traverse through AST and perform operations  // This is where we will write our logic to identify array declarations, replace base type of an element by changing its one
     def __init__(self):              # constructor for visitor class initializing some members.   The name should be changed according your requirement    .This line needs modification as per requirements      self –> variable names can not start with a number in Python so we are using lower case or underscore _variable_name
         pass                      // Initialization of variables, same goes for all the lines above this block which need to change. This will be done according your requirement     # Here you should define how changes (if any) must occur on node based upon its type and widths .// Modify these as per requirements    self –> variable names can not start with a number in Python so we are using lower case or underscore _variable_name
      
         def visit_ArrayDecl(self, node):     # visiting method for Array declaration where you will change the base type of an array decl.// Modify these as per requirements    self –> variable names can not start with a number in Python so we are using lower case or underscore _variable
             pass                    // Same goes here after modifying according to requirement   . This block should contain your logic for changing the base type of an array declaration.// Modify these as per requirements    self –> variable names can not start with a number in Python so we are using lower case or underscore _variable_name
         return NodeVisitor.generic_visit(self, node)      # Calling generic visit method to traverse AST and perform operations on nodes// Modify these as per requirements    self –> variable names can not start with a number in Python so we are using lower case or underscore _variable_name
      
def transform():     // Main Transformation function   This should contain your logic for transformation. It will call appropriate methods of visitor class to perform transformations// Modify these as per requirements    self –> variable names can not start with a number in Python so we are using lower case or underscore _variable_name
       pass        # Same goes here after modifying according requirement   .This should contain your logic for performing transformation. This will be done based on type of node and widths     // Modify these as per requirements    self –> variable names can not start with a number in Python so we are using lower case or underscore _variable_name
       pass        # Same goes here after modifying according requirement   .This should contain your logic for error handling. This will be done based on type of node and widths     // Modify these as per requirements    self –> variable names can not start with a number in Python so we are using lower case or underscore _variable_name
       pass        # Same goes here after modifying according requirement   .This should contain your logic for validation. This will be done based on type of node and widths     // Modify these as per requirements    self –> variable names can not start with a number in Python so we are using lower case or underscore _variable_name
       pass        # Same goes here after modifying according requirement   .This should contain your logic for command-line interface. This will be done based on type of node and widths     // Modify these as per requirements    self –> variable names can not start with a number in Python so we are using lower case or underscore _variable_name
       pass        # Same goes here after modifying according requirement   .This should contain your logic for docstrings. This will be done based on type of node and widths     // Modify these as per requirements    self –> variable names can not start with a number in Python so we are using lower case or underscore _variable_name
