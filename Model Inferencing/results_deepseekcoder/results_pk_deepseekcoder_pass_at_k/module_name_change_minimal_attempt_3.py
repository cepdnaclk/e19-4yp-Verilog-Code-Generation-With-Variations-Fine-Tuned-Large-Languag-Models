Here's a basic example of how you could implement this in Python using argparse for CLI arguments and pyverilog to parse Verilog files as an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree).  This is not complete, but it should give you starting points on what your solution might look like. Note that real-world use cases would require more complex error handling or additional functionality such as preserving the declarations of modules in their usage contexts and generating output to a different file format than Verilog (like SystemVerilog).

```python
import pyverilog  # This is your parser, not an xform module. Also you need `pytest` for unit tests if needed...
from argparse import ArgumentParser   # ...and here to provide a CLI interface via args in main function below......   
    
def parse_args():       // Parse command line arguments  as follows: -f <inputfile>, --oldname  <new name>  etc.     
    parser =ArgumentParser()          
   # Adding optional argument for file and full help will be provided by argparse automatically......       
     return parse_args().__dict__['Arguments']            //Return the arguments list  as dictionary...      
def transform(oldname, newname):     
    try:        
          ast = pyverilog.load('inputfile')   # Load your Verilog file and create an AST here.....       
           visitors_matching()     // Call a visitor function that matches the target elements of xform......      
            return True             // Return true if no errors...      else:                   print("Error in transformation")  &#34;Return Falseâ€œ   catch Exception as e :    "print(str (e))" and retry     # Catch any exceptions.....        def visitors_matching():      
          for node, childrens in ast.walk()      // Walk through the AST with a visitor function to find target nodes......  do something about it... enddef main()-> None:         oldname = parse_args().oldnaem    new name=parse_argser().newname     if transform(old,new):print("Successfully transformed") else print('Transformation failed')
```   // Your transformation function goes here. It will be called by the main() method and uses pyverilog's ast to find nodes that need changing.....  You should add more details about what your visitor looks for (i.e., which types of elements it targets) in visitors_matching().
