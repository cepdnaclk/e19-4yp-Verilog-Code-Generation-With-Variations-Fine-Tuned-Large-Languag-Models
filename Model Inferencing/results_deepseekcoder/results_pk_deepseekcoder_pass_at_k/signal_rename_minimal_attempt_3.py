Here's a basic implementation of your request using PyVerilog, argparse for CLI and re module to handle regex transformations in Python. This is just an example you can adapt it according to specific requirements like error handling or better use cases overhaul the existing xform framework patterns as this does not actually exist yet:
```python
import pyverilog as pv  # PyVerilog AST parser and transformation library for Verilog. It's more of a tool, you would need to implement your own visitor pattern from scratch using it if necessary. Also includes error handling part in the code above which could be added according requirements
import re   // Python built-in module with regular expressions functionality
import argparse  // For command line arguments parsing and usage information generation for user help option/s (e.g., python filename -h)

# Create a visitor class to identify target elements using pyverilog's AST pattern matching feature, it could be extended from this base if necessary:    
class RenameSignalVisitor(pv.ast_visitors.AstVisitor):  # PyVerilog specific syntax for extending AstNode classes which are visited by the visitor based on their class name and file names in pyverilog library's AST structure, e.g., pv.nodes...
    pass   # You can define methods here to match target nodes or implement custom transformation logic when necessary using PyVerilog features like 'replace_child', etc..  you could use this base as a starting point and extend it according your requirements for all signals in the Verilog module, not just whole word matches.
    
def rename(old: str, new:str) -> bool : # Main function to perform transformations on verilog file  
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()  // Create a command line argument object for usage information and handling options in python script by using the 'add_argument' method with appropriate parameters such as help (optional), default etc.., e.g., add_argument('-f', action="store", dest=“file”)
    parser.add_argument("verilogFile")   // Argument for input verilog file path  which is required by user and also set in command line arguments via 'parse' method when call the python script, e., add argument('-f', action = "store", dest="file”)
    args =  parser.parse_args()     # Parse CLI parameters to object   , parse returns namespace obj which can be accessed by using .(property name), for example argobj ‘’s file attribute contains the value passed through command line when calling python script, e., like print('filename:',argobj.)
    try :                           // Python's exception handling mechanism. It will catch any errors and provide a meaningful error message to be displayed if an issue arises during execution of code block in 'try'.  You can add more specific exceptions as needed based on your needs, e., except Exception (e) when you want the script not just general purpose catching for all possible runtime exception or use custom messages.
        ast = pv.parse(args.verilogFile).as_module() // parse verilog file and convert it into a Python module object using PyVerilog's AST parser, e., else: print('Provided File is not Verilog Module') ,  you could use 'else if', elif for more specific error cases as needed.
        visitor = RenameSignalVisitor(old_name= old) // Create a new instance of your custom Visitor using the provided parameters, e., else: print('Error while setting up ast transformer'), re.sub() or similar function to replace signals in AST module and apply transformations based on this logic inside visitor class defined above as per requirement
    except Exception (e):  // Catch all exceptions that can occur during execution of the 'try' block, e., print('Error occurred:', str(sys.exc_info()[0])) or similar function to provide a custom error message when an exception occurs in python script by printing out specific details about raised type and value
        return False  // Return false if any errors occur during execution of code within 'try' block, e., print('Error occurred:', str(sys.exc_info()[0])) or similar function to provide a custom error message when an exception occurs in python script by printing out specific details about raised type and value
    return True  // Return true if no errors occur during execution of code within 'try' block, e., print('Success') followed with the resultant module object after successful transformation. If any exceptions are encountered then it should be handled according to its nature in this part for a better user experience or proper error handling mechanism as required by your project requirements
```  
This is just an example and does not cover all possible scenarios of PyVerilog's AST structure, so you need further development based on actual needs. You may also want rename signal function to handle partial matches if necessary (e., e.g.: old_signal = 'oldSignalName') or more complex logic when multiple signals are found matching the pattern in a way that suits your requirements and project design guidelines such as how you'd like errors/exceptions be handled etc.. 
In addition, PyVerilog is still an experimental library with many features not yet fully implemented. You may want to consider using it under more restrictive conditions or for projects where high-performance criticality over the smaller ones might pose a problem (i.e., in production environments). It's also important that you handle potential issues and errors properly so your program behaves correctly even if they occur unexpectedly, which can be done by adding suitable error handling mechanisms to this code as required based on project requirements or for specific parts of the task where appropriate exception/error logging should take place.
