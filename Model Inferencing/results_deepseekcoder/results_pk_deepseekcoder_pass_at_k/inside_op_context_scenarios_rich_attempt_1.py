Sure, I can provide you a basic structure for your Python module and class definitions that will implement an inside operator visitor in Verilog/SystemVerilog AST traversal using Pyverilog library from Google's C++ Style Checker (pygcov).  Note this is just the core functionality. You need to add additional logic according to actual requirements for error handling and validation, command-line interface design etc., in order implement all functionalities mentioned above:
```python
from pyverilog import parse_file
import re
import argparse
class IncludeOperatorVisitor(object):  # Define the visitor class.
    def __init__(self, signal_name=None) -> None:  
        self._signal = '' if not signal_name else '`'+sigal_name+'{'
        
    @staticmethod    
    async def _visit(node):  # Define a static visit method. This is where all the transformation logic will be placed... e.g., rewriting inside operator usage in code, etc..  
        pass                 
         
def main():                  
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()                   
     ...                       
if __name__ == "__main__":                                 
                          await run(parser)  # Call the asynchronous function to start command-line parsing...      
```              
You need more specifics regarding your requirements such regex transformations, error handling and validation etc., in order for me generate a full Python module that meets all of them. However I can give you an idea about how it should look: 
1) Import necessary libraries (pyverilog).  2) Define the visitor class with methods to identify target elements based on AST patterns as described above within your task requirements in PyVerilog's pyquil library/Google C++ Style Checker.   3) Implement a main method for command-line parsing and use it accordingly while executing code that uses this module from the xform framework, if required by its functionality (like providing error handling).
