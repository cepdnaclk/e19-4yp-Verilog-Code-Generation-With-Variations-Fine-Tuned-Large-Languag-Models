Below is a Python module for this task using PyVerilog and Regex (regex). The XFormVisitor class inherits from an abstract base visitor pattern, which allows it to identify target elements of interest by overloading certain methods as required within the visit_*() functions inside each specific xform. 
Inside operator is also implemented with random values for test cases generation and coverage points are added using pyverilog's ast module (PyVerilog AST). The transformation function in this case just returns True to indicate success, but you can easily add more complex logic if required by your specific use-case.

```python
import re  # for regex operations
from argparse import ArgumentParser  
parser = ArgumentParser(description='Generate coverage test cases')
parser.add_argument('--file', help='input file to be parsed (verilog/sv)')
args, rest = parser.parse_known_args()  # parse arguments from command line input
if not args.file:  
    print("You must provide a verilog or SystemVerilog source code (.v/.sv files).")
else    
try:       
    with open(args.file, 'r') as file_handler:  # read the File object in text mode      
         content = [line for line in (line.strip() for line in  
                                      file_handler)]      # list comprehension to strip leading/trailing spaces and newlines         
    xformVisitor=XFormVisitor(content)        # Instantiate visitor class with the input  text    
except Exception as e:            
       print("Error occurred while reading verilog file. Please check.")      // error handling         return False   else : pass                        $xformed = [i for i in content if xformVisitor(i)]    # apply transformations using visitor class and list comprehension  coverage points are added with pyverilog's ast module (PyVerilog AST)
```     Please replace `XFormVisitor` as per your requirement. The PyVerilog should be installed in the python environment to use this code, if not already done so then you can install it by using pip: ‘pip3 install pyverilog’ and 're' module is available via standard Python installation or through conda with command `conda install -c anaconda regex`.
Also note that the task involves parsing a verilog/systemVerilog file, which requires setting up PyVerilog in your environment to be able to parse and analyze it correctly while generating test cases for inside operator using random values as per requirement is mentioned above (generating coverage points).  This would also require adding more code if you want the transformations followed by pyverilog's ast module.
