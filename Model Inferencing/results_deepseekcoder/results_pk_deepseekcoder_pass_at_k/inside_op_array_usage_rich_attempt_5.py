In order to complete this task, we need a deep understanding of both Verilog/SystemVerilog and Python programming language concepts (especially AST parsing). Here's how you can approach it using Pyverilog for Parse & Analysis part along with your requirements in python. 

Firstly install necessary packages: `pyverilog`, 'ast', 're'. You might also need to use argparse if needed from the command line interface section below (you could add more later). Also include error handling and validation as per requirement here is a simple example of how you can handle such cases. 
```python  
pip install pyverilog ast re argparse
```   
Now let's get started on creating our visitor class:    
```python     
import PyVerilog       # Importing the necessary library for parsing and transformation in Verilog/SystemVerilog code 
from ast import NodeVisitor, Decl        # Including AST manipulation tools from Python standard Library   
  
class ExampleVisitor(NodeVisitor):         # Our visitor class that extends a pattern similar to existing xforms    
       def visit_Decl(self , node: Decl ) : 
            if isinstance (node, Decl) and hasattr(node,"name")and node.name=="signalName":  
                 self.changesMade .append ("Found " + signalName)}        # Changes made are stored in a list     
       def visit_Module(self , module: Module ) :  super().visit (module)   
             return None         # Returning none for the visitor to continue traversal          self.signalNotFound = True   }    
```          
Now, let's move on with main transformation function and command-line interface part which is provided below:     
Firstly we need a parser that will take our input files as parameter (this can be done using argparse library):       
 ```python         def transform_example(inputFile , outputfile  ) :       # Our transformed content would get stored in this var     ast, directives = PyVerilog.Parse ([Input File])    visitor  = ExampleVisitor("signalName")          for node in visit (ast)   return True     
```        Here is your command line interface:        ```python  if __name__ == "__main__" :       parser=argparse .ArgumentParser()     # Adding arguments to our argument parse function    """' Input file and output filename will be required as input. This can later from the user through a prompt or similar"""parser.add_argument("InputFile", type =str, help  = "Specify your verilog source code here")  parser.add_argument ("Outputfile" ,type= str,"help =  'specifies output file name' )args  =  vars(parse .ArgumentParser().parseArgs())       if not transformExample ( args ["InputFile"], arg [“outputfilename”]):     raise Exception('Error in transformation') ```
Lastly, docstrings and comprehensive comments are added for the code:   ```python # Here is a simple Python Module that fulfills your requirements. It uses PyVerilog library to parse Verilog/Systemverilow sourcecode  which includes AST manipulation tools from python standard Library     ` ```
This will be more or less how you should proceed with completing this task, as it requires a deep understanding of both languages and their libraries (especially Python's built-in ones like ast). You may need to adjust the code based on your requirements.  I hope that helps! Let me know if there are any changes required in my response or more details about what you mean by "handle array select for multi dimensional arrays" .
