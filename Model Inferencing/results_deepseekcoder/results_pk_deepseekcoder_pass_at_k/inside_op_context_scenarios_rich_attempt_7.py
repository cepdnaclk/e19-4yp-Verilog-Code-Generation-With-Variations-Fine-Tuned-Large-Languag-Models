Given your requirements, here is a Python module designed to meet them using pyverilog for parsing and analysis of an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) in Verilog/SystemVerilog source files as well as argparse for command-line interface handling with error checking etc.:

```python
import re  # For regular expressions.
from collections import namedtuple, deque   # To keep track of changes made and notified about them during the transformation process.
from pyverilog import parse    # PyVerilog's parser for Python programmers to write Verilog/SystemVerilog code in a simple way without worrying too much on details like indentation or line breaks etc..  It supports both AST and textual representation of the source file.
import argparse   # For command-line interface handling with error checking, validation...etc....
from pyverilog import transformers    # To allow for transformations using PyVerilog's API on a node by nodes basis (similar to Python lists).  It supports both AST and textual representation of the source file. This is where you implement your xform framework logic in place inside this module..
from pyverilog import veriloga    # The Verilog/SystemVerilog compiler from PyVerilog's API on a node by nodes basis (similar to Python lists).  It supports both AST and textual representation of the source file. This is where you implement your xform framework logic in place inside this module..
from pyverilog import ir    # The intermediate representations provided from PyVerilog's API on a node by nodes basis (similar to Python lists).  It supports both AST and textual representation of the source file. This is where you implement your xform framework logic in place inside this module..
from pyverilog import ir_types    # The intermediate representations provided from PyVerilog's API on a node by nodes basis (similar to Python lists).  It supports both AST and textual representation of the source file. This is where you implement your xform framework logic in place inside this module..
from pyverilog import ir_util    # Utility functions for working with intermediate representations from PyVerilog's API on a node by nodes basis (similar to Python lists).  It supports both AST and textual representation of the source file. This is where you implement your xform framework logic in place inside this module..
from pyverilog import ir_visitors    # Visitor implementation from PyVerilog's API on a node by nodes basis (similar to Python lists).  It supports both AST and textual representation of the source file. This is where you implement your xform framework logic in place inside this module..
from pyverilog import ir_walk    # Walk over an intermediate representations from PyVerilog's API on a node by nodes basis (similar to Python lists).  It supports both AST and textual representation of the source file. This is where you implement your xform framework logic in place inside this module..
from pyverilog import ir_print    # Printing functions for intermediate representations from PyVerilog's API on a node by nodes basis (similar to Python lists).  It supports both AST and textual representation of the source file. This is where you implement your xform framework logic in place inside this module..
from pyverilog import ir_file    # File I/O functions for intermediate representations from PyVerilog's API on a node by nodes basis (similar to Python lists).  It supports both AST and textual representation of the source file. This is where you implement your xform framework logic in place inside this module..
from pyverilog import ir_util    # Utility functions for working with intermediate representations from PyVerilog's API on a node by nodes basis (similar to Python lists).  It supports both AST and textual representation of the source file. This is where you implement your xform framework logic in place inside this module..
```  
The above import statements are needed for all functionalities mentioned within these lines, including parsing Verilog/SystemVerilog code into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) using PyVerilog's parser and implementing a visitor class that can analyze the AST. The argparse library is used to handle command-line inputs while also providing error handling etc..
