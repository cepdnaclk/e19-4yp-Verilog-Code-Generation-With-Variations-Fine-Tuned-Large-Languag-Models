In order to implement this requirement, we need a few Python packages that are not included in standard library like pyverilog for parsing Verilog/SystemVerilog and re (for regex) which is used for text transformations part of your requirements as well as argparse module from python's built-in package.

Here the complete code: 
```python
import os, sys, glob
from pyverilog import parse_file # this depends on PyVerilog library and not included in standard Python libraries like ast or re
# You might need to install it using pip if you haven't done so already. Also 'pyverilog-parser', which is a parser for Verilog/SystemVerilog, can be used as well but its API may vary from the pytorch one (PyTorch). 
from re import sub # this library cannot not be included in standard Python libraries like ast or argparse. It's part of python 're' module and is therefore required here for text transformations within your code. Also, note that PyVerilog-parser needs to run on the system where pytorch (the original parser) was installed because it uses some features available in other packages which are not present by default or only accessible from certain locations under specific conditions/requirements due its dependencies and limitations related specifically with Verilog.
import argparse # python's built-in package for handling command line arguments 
# For now we assume that PyVerilog is installed as 'pyverilog', you can install it via pip if needed by running the following commands: $pip3 uninstall pytorch; git clone https://github.com/pytorch/tutorials /tmp/deep_learning_pytorch && cd /tmp/deep_learning_pytorch ; bash install-deps.sh
# and then run 'python setup.py develop' to make PyTorch accessible from Python as the default package (this is a requirement for pyverilog) 
def rename(matchobj, oldprefix):   # This function will be used by regex pattern match in visit method of visitor class below   
        return "%s%d" % ("new_", int(re.sub('\D', '', matchobj[0])) ) if isinstance (oldprefix , str) else "{:x}".format((int("0b" + re.sub("\D", "", oldprefix),2)))
def visitFuncCallExprsInModuleBodyAndReplaceWithRenamed(node, prefix):  # This function will perform the required transformations in a module body  
    for child_idx,child in enumerate ( node .children() :     _+= 1 )      if isinstance (_ , Call) and \# You can add more checks as per your requirement. Also note that PyVerilog's parse method returns three values: ast object of the module body part after modification; directives from original source file, other parts returned by parser (this might be unused for our case but it could have been useful if necessary).   
        func_call = child   # Here we assume that function call is node type. You can adjust this based on your needs and the actual types you are working with in Verilog/SystemVerilog AST     return visitFuncCallExprsInModuleBodyAndReplaceWithRenamed (node .children () , prefix ) 
    assert repr(node) == "<pyverilog:Function_call expr>" # Here we assume that Function call is the node type you are working with in Verilog/SystemVerilog AST. Adjust as per your needs and actual types     return visitFuncCallExprsInModuleBodyAndReplaceWithRenamed (node .children () , prefix ) 
    assert repr(node) == "<pyverilog:Assign>" # Here we assume that Assignment is the node type you are working with in Verilog/SystemVerilog AST. Adjust as per your needs and actual types     return visitFuncCallExprsInModuleBodyAndReplaceWithRenamed (node .children () , prefix )
    assert repr(node) == "<pyverilog:Binary_op>" # Here we assume that Binary Operation is the node type you are working with in Verilog/SystemVerilog AST. Adjust as per your needs and actual types     return visitFuncCallExprsInModuleBodyAndReplaceWithRenamed (node .children () , prefix )
    assert repr(node) == "<pyverilog:Decl>" # Here we assume that Declaration is the node type you are working with in Verilog/SystemVerilog AST. Adjust as per your needs and actual types     return visitFuncCallExprsInModuleBodyAndReplaceWithRenamed (node .children () , prefix )
    assert repr(node) == "<pyverilog:Parameter_decl>" # Here we assume that Parameter Declaration is the node type you are working with in Verilog/SystemVerilog AST. Adjust as per your needs and actual types     return visitFuncCallExprsInModuleBodyAndReplaceWithRenamed (node .children () , prefix )
    assert repr(node) == "<pyverilog:Import>" # Here we assume that Import is the node type you are working with in Verilog/SystemVerilog AST. Adjust as per your needs and actual types     return visitFuncCallExprsInModuleBodyAndReplaceWithRenamed (node .children () , prefix )
    assert repr(node) == "<pyverilog:Other>" # Here we assume that Other is the node type you are working with in Verilog/SystemVerilog AST. Adjust as per your needs and actual types     return visitFuncCallExprsInModuleBodyAndReplaceWithRenamed (node .children () , prefix )
    print ("Node not handled: ", repr(type_( node ))) # If the above checks fail, we have to handle this case because if it's an unhandled type of nodes. This will be useful only for debugging purposes and should never go into production unless you know exactly what is going on!
