Here's a Python module for your requirement using pyverilog, re (for regex operations), and argparse to handle CLI arguments.  Note that this is an advanced task which requires some knowledge of Verilog AST parsing in python as well the use of visitor pattern on modules/files level:

```python
import sys
from collections import namedtuple, defaultdict
import pyveriloglib2pyrexpr.api  # replace with your actual API module (you may have to modify this part)
sys.path.append('./your_other_libs')   # append the directory where you've put 'argparse', etc., modules in python path
import argparse    # importing necessary libraries via command line arguments – these are imported at end of script so they can handle incorrect usage and show help if called without proper parameters.
