Here's a sample Python module for your requirement based on pyverilog and re (regex). This is quite complex, so I will break it down into multiple modules to make everything easier understandable : 

Firstly import necessary libraries/modules at the top of file as follows. You need `pyverilog` library that can parse Verilog code for conversion task:  ```import pyVerilog from verilog_parser`` you also use regex module because we want to change base type via regular expressions, and argparse is used in command-line interface
