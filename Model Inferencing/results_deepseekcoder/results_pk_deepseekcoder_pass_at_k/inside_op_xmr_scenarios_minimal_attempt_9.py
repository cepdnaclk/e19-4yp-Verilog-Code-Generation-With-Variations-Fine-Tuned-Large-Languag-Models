Here is a basic skeleton of how you might structure this task in Python using PyVerilog and argparse for CLI, re to handle regular expressions etc.: 
```python
# Required Libraries/Modules  
import pyverilog as pv    # For parsing Verilog code.
from veripy import Simulator      # To simulate the design using XMR simulators like Vivado or ModelSim for synthesis and simulation of hardware designs in C++, Python scripting language etc.. 
  
import re      
import argparse    # For command line argument parsing (optional)    
        
# Visitor pattern from existing xforms can be implemented using a base visitor class. This will give you the ability to identify and process different parts of your design in various ways, like structural or package references etc.. 
class XformVisitor(object):   # Base Class for all visitors (optional)   
     pass                   # Add more methods as required by Visitors based on Design elements.     
        
# Main Transformation Function      
def xfm_function():        # Implementation of main transformation function         
  parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Xform Testing Module')   # Command line argument parsing (optional)   
    
  return True             # Return true if all tests pass, otherwise false     
        
# Main Function      
def test_main():           # Implementation of main function         
  parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Xform Testing Module')   # Command line argument parsing (optional)   
    
  args = parser.parse_args()                         
            
if __name__ == "__main__":      # Main Function to run the script when executed directly      
 test_main();             
```       
Please note that this is a quite high level and abstracted description of how you might implement such task in Python using PyVerilog, re for regular expressions etc., as well argparse module.  You will need additional details like XMR simulators setup/configuration (in terms similar to Vivado or ModelSim) where the design should be synthesized and simulated respectively from your Verilog code before running tests on it against existing xform framework patterns which are not included in this script due their complexity.
