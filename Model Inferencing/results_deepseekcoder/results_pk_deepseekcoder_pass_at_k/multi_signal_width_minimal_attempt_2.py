Given your requirements, here's a basic implementation of how you could structure this in Python using argparse to handle CLI input and PyVerilog for AST manipulation (although I must stress that it is not complete due to lack of Verilog support). This example assumes the use case where we just want to change signal bit width without handling packed/unpacked arrays:
```python
import argparse  # Python's built-in module used for command line argument parsing.
from pyverilog import parse_expr, Module, verilogify   # PyVerilog is a parser and code generator that supports Verilog syntax only (no SV or SystemVerilog). Here we are using it to extract information from the AST of our design file(s)
import re  # Python's built-in module for regular expressions. Used in regex pattern matching, etc..
from typing import List   # Typing is a standard library that can be used at compile time with classes and functions so they are checked by static type checkers (like pytype). Here we define types using pythonic ones to make our code more readable/self-documented. 
import ast    # Python's built in module for manipulating 'ast'. It is a standard library used at runtime with classes and functions that can be checked by static type checkers (like pytype). Here we are parsing the AST of design file(s) using PyVerilog to find signals.
import xform  # This might not exist, but assuming you've defined an existing module for this purpose in your project named 'xtransform'. If it does then use that instead as per below code snippet which is a basic implementation of the task described above (changing bit width and handling packed/unpacked arrays).
import xform_framework  # Assuming you have already defined an existing framework for this purpose in your project named 'xfrm'. If it does then use that instead. This might not exist yet, so be prepared to implement the missing parts as per requirement or provide a complete implementation of such task if required by other modules like pyverilog etc
    
def change_bitwidth(signal: str , newWidth : int) -> bool:  # Defines function for changing bit width. Returns True/False based on success status to be used in return statement accordingly..   
pass   # Implementing the task of finding each signal's declaration and updating its bit-width specification would go here as per requirement...    
return False;   # This line should never execute, but is required by Python script. If no error has occurred this will be returned to caller (like main method), otherwise it exits with a non-zero status code meaning an issue exists and the function returns accordingly..   
 
def find_targets(module: Module) -> List[ast.Name]:   # Defines visitor for traversing AST tree of module using PyVerilog to extract target signals...    
pass;      # Implement this according based on requirement, might be a case where you want signal's declarations and their bit-width specifications updated..   
return [];  // This line should never execute because we are returning an empty list. But if there is any error in our code then it will return accordingly...   }    
}```      # Defines the end of Python module, this file won't be executed as a standalone script but can act more like library/component for use by other modules or programs..  You would need to expand on these components according your requirements. For example you might want an error handling and validation part in each function based upon requirement that needs it (like validating new width is syntactically correct).
