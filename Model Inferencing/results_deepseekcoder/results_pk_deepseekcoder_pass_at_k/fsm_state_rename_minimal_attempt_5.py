To implement this, we will use a library called `pyverilog` to parse and analyze Verilog files using Abstract Syntax Trees (AST). We'll then create our visitor class that implements transformations based on your requirements by inheriting from the existing xform framework patterns. 

Here is an example of how you might start implementing this:
```python
import pyverilog as pv
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
import re
argparse = __import__('argparse')   # replace with your own argparse if necessary...
parser=argparse.ArgumentParser()     # Create parser  for command line arguments..
parser.add_argument("-i", "--inputfile", dest="inpfiles", required=True, help ='Input Verilog file')   # Add argument --help or -h and define function to handle it...
args = parser.parse_args()  # parse the arguments..    Replace with your own command line implementation if necessary....
```
This part will be replaced by an actual code, where you read a Verilog file using `pyverilog`'s AST parsing capabilities and then implement various transformations based on user-specified prefixes.  For example:
```python
class Visitor(pv.XFormVisitor):   # Define your visitor class... Replace 'abc', if necessary.. Also replace with actual implementation as needed....    Then define the transformation functions for each state/prefix in this new visitor's methods..... The main function will be responsible to call these transformations and handle command line arguments when required.
``` 
This is just a skeleton of how you could structure your code, but it should give an idea about what kind of functionality might need adding depending on the specific requirements (e.g., handling different file formats or extensions). Also make sure all imports are correct and that there's error-handling included for situations where required files/modules aren't found as expected etc...
