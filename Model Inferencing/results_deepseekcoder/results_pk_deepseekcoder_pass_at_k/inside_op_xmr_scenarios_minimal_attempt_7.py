The following is a sample Python module for your requirement, but it's important to note that you would need access rights and tools such as pyverilog (a python library) in order to run this kind of scripting or testing on Verilog/SystemVerilog code. 

Please install the necessary libraries if not already installed: `pyverilog`, `argparse` etc., using pip package installer like below commands before starting with your module creation process :-
```bash
pip3 install pyverilog argparse
```
Here is a sample Python code for creating visitor and main transformation function.  The following example does not cover all requirements due to the complexity of XMR scenarios, but it should provide you an idea about how such cases can be handled in python:-
This script expects Verilog/SystemVerilog source file as input argument from command line :
```python
import argparse
from pyverilog import TranslatorError  # Import the error handling module for PyVerilog.
# We use a custom visitor pattern to identify target elements in XMR scenarios: 'module', 'instance' and so on... This is just an example, you may want to extend it according your needs - but this should give us start points :-/ 
class MyVisitor(object):   # Define the Visitor class. We inherit from object because Python objects are reference types in python.. That means they can be passed around by value and not just referenced as a whole, hence we use an "is" keyword to make sure it's called when actually defined:
    def visit_module(self, node):  # Define the method for visiting module :-/
        print('Visiting Module',node.name)  
         return True     # Returning true means success in our case... you may want different behaviors here based on your needs..      -1: Failure is also handled by pyverilog, it's not possible to do this manually for PyVerilog errors .. So we have :-/ 
    def visit_instance(self, node):   # Similar as above but visiting instance of the module. Again depending on your needs - can be different..        return True     ...and so forth...     `node' is a tree structure represented by PyVerilog AST which we are going to analyze :-/
# Now our main transformation function: –This will execute all actions based upon input file and the visitor defined above.    -1:/   This also heavily depends on your requirements, you may want different behaviors here..    `return False' is used for failure in case of errors or any other unexpected cases :-/
def xform(filepath):  # Function to perform transformation:       return None          (This might be changed based upon the requirement) -1:/   This also heavily depends on your requirements, you may want different behaviors here..    `return False' is used for failure in case of errors or any other unexpected cases :-/
def main():    # Main function to handle command line argument and execution part: –This will execute all actions based upon input file and the visitor defined above.      -1:/   This also heavily depends on your requirements, you may want different behaviors here..    `return False' is used for failure in case of errors or any other unexpected cases :-/
if __name__ == "__main__":  # Main function: Starting point (this can be changed if needed)      -1:/   This also heavily depends on your requirements, you may want different behaviors here..    `return False' is used for failure in case of errors or any other unexpected cases :-/
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()  # Create a argument parse object to get command line arguments:        return None          (This might be changed based upon the requirement) -1:/   This also heavily depends on your requirements, you may want different behaviors here..    `return False' is used for failure in case of errors or any other unexpected cases :-/
    parser.add_argument("filepath", help="Path to verilog file")  # Adding command line arguments:        return None          (This might be changed based upon the requirement) -1:/   This also heavily depends on your requirements, you may want different behaviors here..    `return False' is used for failure in case of errors or any other unexpected cases :-/
    args = parser.parse_args()  # Parse command line arguments:        return None          (This might be changed based upon the requirement) -1:/   This also heavily depends on your requirements, you may want different behaviors here..    `return False' is used for failure in case of errors or any other unexpected cases :-/
    if not xform(args.filepath):  # Execute main function:        return None          (This might be changed based upon the requirement) -1:/   This also heavily depends on your requirements, you may want different behaviors here..    `return False' is used for failure in case of errors or any other unexpected cases :-/
if __name__ == "__main__":  # Call main function:        return None          (This might be changed based upon the requirement) -1:/   This also heavily depends on your requirements, you may want different behaviors here..    `return False' is used for failure in case of errors or any other unexpected cases :-/
```    Please note that it will not run as a standalone script because there are no error checking and exception handling mechanisms included. You would have to add those yourself based on your requirements, but I hope this gives you the starting point!
