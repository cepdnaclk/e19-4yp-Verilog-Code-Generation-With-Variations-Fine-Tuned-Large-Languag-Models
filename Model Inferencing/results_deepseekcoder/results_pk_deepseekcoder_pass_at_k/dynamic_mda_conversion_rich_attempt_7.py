I'm sorry but your request is a bit complex and it seems like you need to implement two separate transformations, one for fixed arrays (using PyVerilog) and another from dynamic multi-dimensional array declarations in Python scripting language using regular expressions or similar techniques. This will require some knowledge of both Verilog/SystemVerilog syntax as well as the use of a programming paradigm such as Object Oriented Programming with classes, methods, etc., which is not directly supported by PyVerilog at this time (as far I know).

Here's an example on how you might approach each part: 
- For fixed arrays in Verilog/Systemverilog using Python. We can use `pyverilog` for parsing and analyzing the AST, as it is a tool to parse SystemVerilog files (in fact its main target file extension is .sv). But you will need additional tools like PyBV or similar which are not directly available in this library:
```python
import pyverilog.corelib  # Contains basic functionality of the language, such as parsing and verifying modules etc...  
from collections import defaultdict    
def convert_fixed(file):   
        ast = parser([input])      // Use PyVerilog's AST module to parse Verilog/Systemverilog file.  The result is a tree of the abstract syntax (AST) represented as an ordered sequence, where each node in this list represents one construct element present at that location within source code or input data stream
        changes = defaultdict(list[str])   // A dictionary to store textual change reports for every found fixed array.  Each key is a 'fixed' identifier and value should be the set of all transformations made on it (e.g., dynamic multi-dimensional arrays).         pd_changes["array1"] += ["Found {0}", "Changed type from int to float".format(item)]
        def visit_(node):  // Create a visitor function that will recursively traverse the abstract syntax tree and apply necessary transformations on 'fixed' array declarations. This is where you would implement your logic for finding fixed arrays, converting them into dynamic multi-dimensional ones etc...     if node_is(Decl)
        visit_(ast))  // Apply this visitor to our AST   return changes    // Return the set of all change reports made by transformations on found 'fixed' declarations. This can be used in other parts/modules where you need a report about transformation results etc...      def transform_example(input, output):
            pd = parser([output]) 
        if isinstance_(pd[0], NodeMod) and hasattr (node_, "name") ...   // Check whether the parsed file content represents modifications to systemverilog files. This will be `True` only when we find a SystemVerilog module that was modified from an original one, so this part can also check if input is indeed Verilog/Systemveerlom source code
```  (Note: You should replace the placeholders with your actual logic)   and it's worth noting you need to use `pyverilog.utils` for parsing AST from file paths etc... It may be helpful in understanding how PyVerilog works under this context.)    Finally, I would recommend looking into using a more modern language like C++ or Rust if performance is an issue and/or you're not already familiar with them (as they have better support for these types of transformations). 
   If the requirement isnâ€™t too complex so that it can be handled in one go, I would suggest refining your design to avoid unnecessary computations. For example: You could use a `Set` or similar data structure instead/instead of using an array when possible and store all changes within this set rather than storing them separately as list for each fixed identifier etc...
