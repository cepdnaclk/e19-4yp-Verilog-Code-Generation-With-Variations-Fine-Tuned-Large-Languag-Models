Here's a basic example of how you could implement this in Python using argparse for CLI, PyVerilog to parse and analyze AST (Abstract Syntax Trees), re for regular expressions handling text transformations etc.: 
```python
import pyverilog as pv
from abc import ABCMeta, abstractmethod
import inspect
import re
try: # Python >= 3.5
    from collections.abc import Callable
except ImportError:   # < 3.5 only need the `Callable` class explicitly defined in newer versions (2.7+) 
    pass
from typing import Any, Union, List, Tuple
import argparse
parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Parse and analyze Verilog code')   # Creating an argument parser to accept user input command line arguments for verilog file path etc., via CLI 
group1 = parser.add_argument_group('arguments related to the verification task or xform module itself ')   
parser.add_argument("--file", type=str, help="Path of Verilog source code")   # Adding a command line argument for input file path (mandatory in order not just optional). 
args = parser.parse_args()     # Parses arguments from the cmdline and stores them into args object which can be accessed later on using vars(args) statement, like: print("file name is ",vars().get('__name__'))   for getting file's current running state (this script).
# Now we have a parser to parse command line arguments – here begins the program. As per your requirements this part can be further divided into smaller sub-parts and methods in order to make it more manageable, but let’s start with that!:   # Beginning of main code segment related task specification
def xform_main():    """Main function for transformation module"""  def parse(file):     p = pyverilog.parseFile(pyverilog.fromPathNameOrSourceCodeString('', file))       return p      @abstractmethod         # Decorator to denote abstract method which must be implemented in subclasses of XForm
class Verifier:    """Base class for verifying xform modules"""     def verify_ast():        pass — Abstract Method   try/except block as per your requirement and write proper error handling. The implementation should call the parse() function with file argument, then run visitor method on parsed AST tree using a visit pattern defined in XForm base class
class InsideVisitor(Xform):    """Specialized Visitor for testing inside operator"""     def __init__(self)        self._inside_counts = {} — Counter to record how many times `x` is 'outside' of block or procedural context. You can use this counter as your verification result
class MainTransform:    """Main Transform Class for handling transformation task"""      @staticmethod     def transform(file):        p=parse('--args') if not args.__getattr__("help"): pass  # Checking help argument, then exit. If there is a command line input file name and it exists or the user wants to see how does pyverilog parse this verilog source code string
```   Please note that you need PyVerilog library for parsing Verilog syntax trees in Python from your requirement description above; You can use pip install as below: ‘pyverilog’. This is a very basic implementation and might require more sophisticated handling of the AST, error checking etc., depending on requirements but should serve to give you an idea about how it could be structured.
