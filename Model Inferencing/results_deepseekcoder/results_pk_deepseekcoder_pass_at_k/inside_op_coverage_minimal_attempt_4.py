Here's a Python module for your requirement using PyVerilog and argparse to create CLI interaction, which may be further enhanced by adding more sophisticated coverage points in this case as it requires complex logic of identifying inside operator based on AST nodes pattern matching etc., rather than regex.  Also note that error handling is not included here but should ideally include for production-level code:
```python
import pyverilog
from argparse import ArgumentParser, FileType   # Python's builtin arguments parsing module

# Define a visitor class following the xform pattern. This may require more detailed work based on your requirement (matching AST nodes etc.) 
class XFormVisitor(object):   
     def visit_node_(self, node: pyverilog._ast_.Module) -> bool:# define as per existing visitor's logic... Here we assume the target is a module and return True/False on success. Replace with your specific requirement based AST nodes visiting pattern.. 
        pass   # Placeholder for later implementation, depends upon what you want to do at each node visitation point    
     
# Define main transformation function which will use visitor class:   
def transform(verilog_file):      
    parser = pyverilog.parse('test' if __name__ == 'main' else FileType(), verilog_file)  # Parse the AST from file or directly content based on `if` statement condition.. Here we assume you have a function to get input as per your requirement
    visitor = XFormVisitor()  
     for node in parser:        visited=visitor.visit(node))      return not any_failed  # Return True if no nodes failed, False otherwise (in case of error).. Replace with actual logic here... Here we assume `any_failed` is the list which stores all failure points
     raise ValueError("No valid Verilog file provided.")  
      
# Set up command-line interface:   
def main():     
  parser = ArgumentParser(description="PyVerilog based transformation module") # Create argument parsing object.. Here we assume you have a function to get input as per your requirement        pyverilog_file =  ...   # Get CLI inputs, replace with actual logic here...    transform(pyverilog_file) 
                                                                                if __name__ == 'main' and not transformed: raise SystemExit("No valid Verilog file provided.")# If we didnt get any transformations then exit the program.. Replace as per requirement.   # Provide error handling for CLI inputs here...    main(pyverilog_file)
```  This is a general idea and may need modification based on your specific requirements like how you want to match AST nodes, where inside operator should come from etc., also the logic of generating random values or test cases will depend upon what kind of transformations are required. Make sure that argparse module in Python has been imported successfully at top section as well make any other necessary imports accordingly based on your requirements like sys for handling exceptions and so forth,
