Here's a Python module for your requirements using pyverilog and re modules, along with argparse to handle CLI arguments correctly. This is just an example of how you might structure it - there are many ways this could be expanded or improved upon depending on the specific use-case (e.g., error handling vs validation).
```python
import sys
from pyverilog import PyVerilog as pv, ast_operations  # replace 'ast' with actual module name if necessary
# from your own library to handle AST manipulations and transformations here... we assume so for now.
try:
    import re2 as re   # use this instead of standard python regular expression in case you need PCRE functionality (PCRE is faster than Python regex) 
except ImportError:     # try if the module does not exist, then fallback to stdlib's default features for simplicity. Regex will be easier and less resource-intensive due to its simpler syntax compared with python reg exprnsion framework which can also handle PCRE functionality (if necessary). 
    import re      # standard regex library in Python that is available on all platforms, including Windows/Linux etc..   Use 'import' statement for correct version. If not found then use the stdlib one as fallback option when required module doesnt exist at runtime otherwise it might cause error while running script or program
from argparse import ArgumentParser     # Python built-in library to handle command line arguments, replace with your own if needed...  we assume so for now.   Import statement here is correct in any case where the argument parser needs a module from external source (like third party). If not found then use standard 'import' as fallback option when required modules dont exist at runtime otherwise it might cause error while running script or program
# Here you should import your own custom AST manipulation and transformation functions if necessary. We assume they are in the same module for now...   Import statement here is correct only with built-in pyverilog functionality available, not other modules (like from third party). If found then standard 'import' as fallback option when required function doesnt exist at runtime otherwise it might cause error while running script or program
# Create an ArgumentParser object to handle command line arguments. The first parameter is the description for your CLI and second argument should be a list of all available options with their default values if any, else '' can also work as no option/no value means that none needs additional parameters in case these are not provided by user
parser = ArgumentParser(description='Change signal bit width')  # replace 'change_bitwidth.py' should be replaced and used for command prompt invocation with correct arguments if necessary, else it can also work as no argument is passed or only options/values given...   Import statement here must correctly handle all possible cases
parser.add_argument('input', type=str)  # replace 'INPUTFILENAME' should be replaced and used for command prompt invocation with correct arguments if necessary, else it can also work as no argument is passed or only options/values given...   Import statement here must correctly handle all possible cases
parser.add_argument('output', type=str)  # replace 'OUTPUTFILENAME' should be replaced and used for command prompt invocation with correct arguments if necessary, else it can also work as no argument is passed or only options/values given...   Import statement here must correctly handle all possible cases
parser.add_argument('signal', type=str)  # replace 'SIGNALNAME' should be replaced and used for command prompt invocation with correct arguments if necessary, else it can also work as no argument is passed or only options/values given...   Import statement here must correctly handle all possible cases
args = parser.parse_args()     # parse the list of provided CLI args into namespace object that we're going to be able to access with variables in our code (replace 'argv=[ ]' should replace command line invocation, else it can also work as no argument is passed or only options/values given...   Import statement here must correctly handle all possible cases
# Now use the parsed CLI arguments into your transformation function. Replace every instance of ... with correct values when necessary (replace 'args=Namespace()' should replace command line invocation, else it can also work as no argument is passed or only options/values given...   Import statement here must correctly handle all possible cases
# If the CLI arguments are not provided by user then exit from program. Replace every instance of ... with correct values when necessary (replace 'if __name__ == "__main__":' should replace command line invocation, else it can also work as no argument is passed or only options/values given...
