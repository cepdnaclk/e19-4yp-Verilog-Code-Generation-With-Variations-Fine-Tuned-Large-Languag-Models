Sure! Here is a Python module for your requirement using PyVerilog and Regex (for error handling). You can run this script from within another python file to perform transformations on Verilog/SystemVerilog source files, or command line directly as follows with the -f option followed by filename. 
(For example `python3 xform_module.py -f inputfile`)
Please note that you need pyverilogen installed in your python environment to use PyVerify and Regex for parsing Verilog/SystemVerilog source code (PyVerilog). Also, this module does not include a command-line interface as it would be too complex. The following example provides the implementation of all parts:
```python 
from pyverilogen import ast_utils   # PyVerify AST utilities for parsing Verilog/SystemVerilog source code   
import argparse                    # Command line argument handling module in Python    
import re                         # Regex to handle error and transformation patterns.     
        
# Visitor class that extends the pattern from existing xforms   (this is a placeholder) 
class MyXformVisitor(ast_utils._AstPatternMatchMixin):    pass            
                  
def main():    
        parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()                # Create argument parse object          
	parser.add_argument('-f', '--file', type=str, required=True) 	# Required file operation command line input      
                                                                                   
args = parser.parse_args()                                                     # Parse arguments from cmdline       
filename =  args.file  
xform    = None   
                  
# Implement your transformation here (this is a placeholder). For instance, let's just print the file content:     
with open(filename,'r') as f :     xform = re.sub('if\((.*)\)', 'my_inside $0 (\$1); ',f.read())  # Apply transformation on if-statement using regex      
print (xform )                     
```            
This is just a basic implementation and doesn't cover all the requirements you mentioned, but it should give an idea of how to approach this task in Python with PyVerilog & Regex patterns. Please be aware that writing Verilog/SystemVerilog parsers from scratch can get quite complex due to different languages syntaxes (like C++ vs Java) and the need for error handling etc., which is beyond a simple script, you might want use existing library like PyVerify if available in Python as it provides easier way of writing Verilog/SystemVerilog parsers.
