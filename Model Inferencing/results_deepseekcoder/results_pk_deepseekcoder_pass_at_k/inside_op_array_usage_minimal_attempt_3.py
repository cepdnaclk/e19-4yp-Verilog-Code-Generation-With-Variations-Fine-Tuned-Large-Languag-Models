Here's a basic example of how you could implement this in Python using argparse for CLI, PyVerilog to parse and analyze Verilog AST etc.: 

```python
import pyverilog as pv
from verilog import ast as v_ast
import re
import sys
import inspect
sys.path.insert(0,'/usr/local/lib') # Add your lib directory to python path, for XMR and function call index test cases 
                                     # Assuming the xform library is in this folder or similar location with PyVerilog libraries available   
from my_xform import MyXFormVisitor   // Implement visitor pattern here based on existing transformers provided by your framework (e.g., pyverilog)
import argparse 
parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='PyVerilog XMR Example')
parser.add_argument('-v', '--file', type=str, help="The verilog file to process")   // Add argument for your files here   
args = parser.parse_args() 
if __name__ == "__main__":    
        with open(args.file) as f:       // Open and read the provided Verilog code in python, similar functionality of PyVerilog's parse method     
            src=f.read().decode('utf-8') 
            
    ast = v_ast.parse(src).body   // Parse verilog AST from source    
visitor = MyXFormVisitor()           // Instantiate visitor class with your custom xform pattern in it     
result, success  = pv.analyze(ast , visitor)  // Run analysis on the parsed ast using defined visit method (your code here as per PyVerilog's analyze function), and return result     if successful or not    else print an error message  
if __name__ == "__main___" :     
        sys.exit(not success )       // Exit with non-zero status on failure, similar functionality of the above line in PyVerilog's analyze function         
``` 
This is a very basic example and may need to be adapted based upon your exact requirements or constraints. Also note that you will have to implement `MyXFormVisitor` according to existing transformers provided by pyverilog, as per the requirement given in task description above which involves using arrays inside operator etc., for XMR function call index test cases and handling multi-dimensional array selects scenarios of constant or variable indices. 
In Python's argparse module you can define command line arguments with `add_argument` method that will be accessible from python script via the sys argument passed to it as an input in CLI mode (like using -v --file=myFile option). For XMR and function call index test cases, we are assuming your xform library is available at a directory specified by path. Replace '/usr/local/lib' with actual location of where the libraries for PyVerilog exist to handle these scenarios in Python script if it changes elsewhere or not present. 
The ast module from verilog provides functionality similar as pyverilog and we are using this parser method that is used here by parsing source code given into a string format, which can be read line-wise for large files etc., to get the AST of your Verilog Code in Python. 
In `MyXFormVisitor` class you need implementation based on how transformations will occur using PyVerilog's methods and functionality as per existing transformers available from pyverilog library, which is similar like a visitor pattern that identifies target elements to perform the actual text transformation etc., in this case. 
Please note: This code may not work for every single use-case or could be too complex due lack of specifics about what you want your transformations and how they should behave with arrays inside operator, XMR function call index test cases scenarios within multi dimensional array select scenario constant/variable indices etc., as these are quite non typical uses in a general Python scripting language.
