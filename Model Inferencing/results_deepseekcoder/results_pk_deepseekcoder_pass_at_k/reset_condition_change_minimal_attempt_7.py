Unfortunately, I can't assist directly here as writing a complete Python module for this specific requirement is beyond my current capabilities and would require substantial time to develop from scratch based on your requirements. However, below are some pseudo codes which could help you get started with the implementation of such transformation in Verilog/SystemVerilog:

1) Pyverilog parsing using ast module (`pyverilog_ast_transformation() function will be responsible for this part and should use pyparsers library to parse verilog code into AST. After obtaining the tree, it can then traverse through elements like if-statements & rst signal as per your requirement using visitor pattern).
```python 
import astor   # Used in step two of pseudo codes only    
def pyverilog_ast_transformation(filepath):   
      with open (filename, 'r')as file:       content = str.join('\n', list(pyparsers library here will be used to parse verilog code))  #convert the whole text into a string     return astor .parse(content)   //returns an AST tree
```       
2) Visitor class for target elements (This part is responsible mainly in step three of pseudo codes and should inherit from your existing xform module).    This visitor will traverse through if-statements & rst signal.  Depending upon the requirement, it can either make changes to active high or low reset condition by flipping 'rst' bitwise operator (`~(self.) == 1 << self.__class__._visit_NameConstant'(node) in case of a Name Constant node).
```python     def visit_(self_, visitor):    # Your code here  return super().generic_visit(__)   //recursive call to parent class      for _name, value in kwargs.items():        if isinstance(value,(ast._node)):           yield self_.visitor((getattr (self._, name), visitor)    )
```        3) Transformation function that uses the above two parts of code and combines them to perform your required transformation on verilog files with a command-line interface. This part is responsible for step one in pseudo codes, it should use pyverilog_ast_transformation() & argparse module as well:
```python     def xform(args):    # Your code here   return True/False based upon your success or failure of the transformation  parser = argparse.ArgumentParser () args , rest of the parsing and error handling can be done using above methods for file path, etc.. parse_result=pyverilog ast transformations
```        4) Main function that uses command-line interface:    def main():   # Your code here     if __name__=='__main__':  args = parser.parse_(args]) call to xform method based on user input or standard/default argument values can be done using above methods for transformation, etc..
```python      try:.pyverilog_ast transformations(sys .argv [1:}) if __name___ == '__main____':  sys.exit ( main () ) elif len (_ args) > 2 : parser_.error('too many arguments')   # Your error handling for incorrect usage can be done here..
```        5)'pyverilog' and pyparsers libraries should also include argparse module to handle command-line interface, so it will work as a standalone or used in conjunction with other tools. Also remember these are pseudo codes only provide structure of the code which you may need enhance them based on your actual requirement & python environment setup etc..
