Here is an example of how you can create a Python module for your requirement, using PyVerilog to parse and analyze Verilog/SystemVerilog ASTs. This includes creating a visitor class that identifies target elements based on certain signal names in the codebase (in this case `signals`), implementing regex transformations as required by you task specification(using python's re module for pattern matching, replacing etc.), and handling errors properly with appropriate return codes:
```python
import argparse  # command-line interface
from pyverilog import parse_expr   # parser library to interpret Verilog/SystemVerilog code into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) structure. Can be used for both C++, Python and SystemV programs using ASTs as the primary data structures that are handled by PyVerilog
import re  # regex module in python which is responsible of performing text transformations on input files containing Verilog/Systemverig code to match specific patterns or perform operations. For instance: replacing certain signals, adding new ones etc..  
from random import randrange as rr    # for generating different values randomly from an array 
import ast     # python's built-in AST module that can be used by visitors and traversers in Python to build abstract syntax trees. In the context of your task, it will help us understand how nodes are visited during parsing process  
from inspect import getmembers    # for getting methods from a class or an object 
import os       # python's built-in module that can be used by our test cases to check if files exist and/or directories exists. It is generally useful in writing tests with file I/O, directory handling etc..  
from unittest import TestCase    # Python’s standard library for unit testing – a type of "test case" - which you can use by subclassing the built-in 'TestCase' class and adding your test cases into it. Each method within this will be treated as an independent set of tests in itself
from string import Template   # python module that allows us to create strings using placeholders ($variable) – these variables are replaced with values from our data structures at runtime, e.g., the 'randrange' function is used here for generating different random numbers each time a test case runs and thus it will give you an independent set of tests

class ExampleVisitor(ast.NodeVisitor):   # visitor class inheritance pattern to understand how nodes are visited in Verilog/SystemVerilog ASTs during parsing process – for example, we can use Python's built-in 'isinstance', and other utility methods available on Node instances (to check if a node has specific attributes or children)
    def __init__(self):   # constructor method that initializes the signals to be searched in codebase. It is called when our visitor instance gets created, e.g., every time we create an 'ExampleVisitor' object and call its visit() function – it can also accept command-line arguments from user
        self.signals = ['signal1', 'signal2']   # list of signal names to search in codebase for matches with our visitor instance’s signals parameter: e.g., if a match is found, we will call the visit() method on this node object and its children – it can be used as an example
        self.changes_made = []    # keeps track of changes made while visiting nodes in AST (e.g.: signal name matches)  
        ~/ ~$ python3 -m unittest xformTestModuleNameHereYourUnitTestsGoThere  --capture=no     //this command is used to execute the unit tests with coverage, if you have not installed 'coverage' then install it first and run this in your terminal. It will give a report about code quality based on test cases
