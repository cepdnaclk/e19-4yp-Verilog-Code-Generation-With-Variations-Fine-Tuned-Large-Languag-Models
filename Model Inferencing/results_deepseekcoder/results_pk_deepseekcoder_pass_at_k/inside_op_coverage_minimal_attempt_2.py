Your task is complex and requires a deep understanding of Python, Verilog/SystemVerilog programming languages as well as their syntaxes including AST (Abstract Syntax Trees), visitors design pattern for identifying elements in an abstract syntactic tree or any other data structure like array etc., regex patterns to perform transformations on the test cases.
Below is a simplified version of how you might approach this task:
```python
import pyverilog  # PyVerilog library used here only as example, actual implementation can be different based upon your requirement and setup  
from verilog_ast import NodeVisitor    # AST visitor for xform framework pattern    
import re                       # Regex module to perform transformations on test cases.     
import argparse               # Command line argument parser 

class XForm(NodeVisitor):       # Visiting Class inherits from existing patterns  
        def visit_module(self, node: Node) -> None :    ...          # Fill this with your xform logic here.    
        
def main():                   # Main Function 
      parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()      
      parser.add_argument('file', type=str , help=  'Verilog file to be transformed')  
                                                                                                                 
if __name__ == "__main__":   
     args = parser.parse_args()                            # Parsing command line arguments 
                              
with open(args.file, mode = 'r', encoding="utf8") as f:      # Reading Verilog file  
         pyverilogAST  = pyverilog.parseFile (f)     ...    # Fill this with actual implementation based on your requirement and setup 
                                                                                                                  
xform = XForm()                            # Instantiate the visitor class                 
res =  xform .visit(pyverilogAst )          # Performing transformation  
```     
This is a very basic example of how you might approach this task. The actual implementation can vary greatly based on your specific requirements and setup, but hopefully it gives you an idea about the structure that needs to be followed in order for such tasks (like generating test cases with random values or any other xform functionality).
