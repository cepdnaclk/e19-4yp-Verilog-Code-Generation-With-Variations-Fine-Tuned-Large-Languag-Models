To implement this task, I will use PyVerilog to parse and analyze Verilog syntax tree (AST), then create a visitor class that identifies target elements in AST for transformation purposes. The main part of your request is accomplished by defining a transformer function which uses regex patterns or other similar transformations on the fixed array declarations found within an XML file, while also handling multiple dimensions and preserving base signal type/width information as requested earlier.

Here's how you can start: 
```python
from pyverilog import parse_file
import re
class ArrayTransformer(object): #define a visitor class that inherits from existing xforms
    def __init__(self, verilogmodule=None):
        self.ast = None   # The AST after parsing 
    	# Initialize other variables as required by your task... for example:      
	pass           
     		        			          					                    				              	   						             	 	       	     							            								   	}def visit_array(self, node): pass        def main():   # Create a command-line interface to test the module with different files  ... etc.```     In this part of your code you should use PyVerilog's parse function and walk over its AST using visitor pattern (or similar strategy). You can find more information in pyverilog documentation or source repository on GitHub
