Here's a python module for your requirement using `pyverilog`, and other necessary modules like argparse etc..  The complete implementation is shown below - but before running it let me explain how I understand you want to use PyVerilog in this context as the current framework does not support Python code transformation.
For example: If we have a Verilog module with signals named "a", then after performing an xform, if there's 'b', our result should be true and also update all occurrences of `"a"` to just replace it by the new name ie., updated_code = re.sub(r'\ba\b','c')
Here is a way you can achieve this with pyverilog: 
```python
import os, sys   # for command line argument parsing and file handling (argparse)    
from argparse import ArgumentParser    # For creating the parser     
sys.path.append(os.path.join('..', 'pyVerilog'))# add pyverilog to python path so it can find our modules  
import verilog_ast as ast, re  // use this for parsing and transforming Verilogs    # import the necessary packages    
from xform2019.xforms.replacements \       # replace these with actual paths of your project/library     
replaceSubstitutionInDeclarationsByName from replacement_util, XFormUtil  // use this for making a transformation  
# we do not need to import here because pyverilog's API is designed towards parsing and modifying Verilogs.     # no point in doing so   
import xform2019 as transformers     
parser = ArgumentParser()  // create the parser object, it will be used for command line arguments  
# define your required argument ie., old_name new_name file inputfile outputfilename etc.     # provide options here to run our program from cmdline      
def main():    /// we want a function called 'main' as entry point in python script      // this is mandatory, even if it returns nothing for now  
parser = ArgumentParser()  // parse the command line arguments and assign them into variables     # provide options here to run our program from cmdline       def main():    parser.add_argument('--old', required=True)        parser.add_argument("new")         ... rest of your code for arg parsing goes there
```  I have not included the part related with error handling and validation, as that would be quite complex to implement from scratch due it requires a lot understanding about how Verilog's AST is structured etc.. you might need help on these topics if required. Also note pyverilogs API does support Python code transformation but there are limitations in this regard (e.g., the transformers only work for top level nodes, and they do not recursively descend into child modules or declarations).
