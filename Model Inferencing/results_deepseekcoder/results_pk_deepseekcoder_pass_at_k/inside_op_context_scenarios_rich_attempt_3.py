Here's a Python module for your requirements using PyVerilog and regex, along with an example visitor class that follows this pattern from other XForm examples (`ExampleVisitor`). 
Please note you need to replace `pattern` in line containing the replacement function call by actual string/regex patterns. Also add more specific handling of if-statements context based on your use case requirement: e.g., check for conditions inside statements, or handle procedural and initial_final block contexts separately depending upon requirements (currently only support loops & continuous assignments).
Also note that the function `transform` in this module is called as follows at a CLI to perform transformation - 
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    
    # Adding arguments for command line inputs: file, output_file and signal name  
    parser.add_argument('-i', '--inputFile', required=True) 
    parser.add_argument('-o', '--outputFile', default ='out')
    parser.add_argument('-s','--signalName',required= True )            # Add more arguments as per your requirement for command line inputs  
    
    args, _ =  parser.parse_known_args() 
      
      if not os.path.exists(os.path.abspath('.') + "/" +  str(".py")):       
          print("No such file or directory")         # Check for the existence of input files in current folder  
     else :              
            transform_example (args.inputFile, args.outputfile ,  args.signalName)    # Transform and save output to a new python module named out .py if not present otherwise it will overwrite with same name as old file but different extension e.g., xfm_.py  
```     
Remember that the transformation function (`transform_example()` in this case), is where you'll perform your actual regex transformations, and error handling would be done at a higher level inside `ExampleVisitor` class with its methods such as visit(), changesMade etc. This example does not include all possible edge cases but should give an idea of how to implement the whole system based on requirements given in task description above (inside operator usage for different contexts, loop and continuous assignments handling).
