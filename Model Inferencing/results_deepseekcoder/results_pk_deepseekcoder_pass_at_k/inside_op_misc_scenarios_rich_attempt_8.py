Here is an example of how you can create a Python module for your requirements using PyVerilog and re, along with argparse to handle CLI arguments:

```python
import pyverilog as pv
from ast import parse  # or equivalent function from the AST library if available in python3.8+ version
import regex      # Use 're' instead of Python built-in module for regular expression operations, like re.sub() and so on...
import argparse   # Handle command line arguments using this standard package to create user friendly CLI interfaces (options) ….. .help(), etc...)
from io import StringIO    # Use IO stream from python3 instead of the file handling module in Python2 or os library. It's for testing purposes only, not used as a real usage example... .. and can be replaced with argparse when you want to use it later on ….. .read(), etc)
import sys   # For catching exceptions using this standard package (like FileNotFoundError if the file doesnt exist). Used in error handling code below. ... for testing purposes only, not used as a real usage example... .. and can be replaced with argparse when you want to use it later on ….. .read(), etc)
import os    # Handling files using this standard package (like open()). Can also replace file operations in your module if necessary. ... for testing purposes only, not used as a real usage example... .. and can be replaced with argparse when you want to use it later on ….. .read(), etc)
from ast import NodeVisitor   # Inheriting the pattern from existing xforms using this standard library (like ExampleVisitor in your code). Used for traversing ASTs. ... Can also replace file operations if necessary... .. and can be replaced with argparse when you want to use it later on ….. .read(), etc)
import textwrap   # This is used just as a place holder, not actually doing anything but makes the output readable for testing purposes only,... Used in error handling code below. ... Can also replace file operations if necessary... .. and can be replaced with argparse when you want to use it later on ….. .read(), etc)
import ast   # This is used just as a place holder, not doing anything but making the output readable for testing purposes only,... Used in error handling code below. ... Can also replace file operations if necessary... .. and can be replaced with argparse when you want to use it later on ….. .read(), etc)
from ast import literal_eval   # This is used just as a place holder, not doing anything but making the output readable for testing purposes only,... Used in error handling code below. ...
