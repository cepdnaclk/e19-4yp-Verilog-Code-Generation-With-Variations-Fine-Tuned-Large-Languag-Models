Sure, here's a Python module for your requirement using `pyverilog` and regular expressions to rename FSM state names throughout modules in Verilog/SystemVerilog language (as per provided requirements). 
Please note that this is an advanced task which requires knowledge of both the AST(Abstract Syntax Tree) parser library called PyVerilog, as well regex for text transformations. If you don't know how to use these libraries or not familiar with them, I recommend doing some learning and experimenting first before trying out here in a real scenario context:
```python 
import pyverilog       # Libraries required by the task are PyVerilog itself which is already included. So no need for imports there separately. If you want to parse Verilog code, then use ply verilog parser from Python's standard library (`ply.lex() and PLY `)
import re              # Required module as per requirement 13/4 in the task description; handles regular expressions for renaming state names etc..   Regex is a powerful tool to manipulate text, here we are using it on both sides of operation at different stages during parsing. It does not require an import but used there
import argparse         # Required module as per requirement 3 in the task description; handles command line argument extraction and usage assistance   ArgumentParser is a built-in function provided by Python to create commandline interfaces, here we are using it for extracting arguments.   
    
def visit_state(node):       # Visitor's main method which visits each node in the AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)  as per requirement  1/4 of task description; a base class or parent to other classes that need naming transformations is created here, so all visitors must have this feature.
    if hasattr(node,'name') and re.search('state',node['type']):     # If node's type matches 'state'. The regular expression used checks for state in any part of the name  (like FSM_STATE or STATE), as per requirement  2/4 about checking names, here it is done with a regex match to check if there exists "State" anywhere.
        print('Found State:',node['name'])      # Printing found node's information for debugging purpose 3rd part of task description; this can be removed depending on the requirement or not at all  2/4 in nature, we are printing here to keep track which state is being renamed.
        new_state = re.sub('State','New',node['name'])     # Substituting 'Name' with just New  for a complete match of pattern as per requirements   10th part about the text substitution in regex, if there exists "State" anywhere then replace it completely to something like `new_state`
        node.update({'type':re.sub('(?<=\b)STATE(\b)',"New",node['name']),})     # Updating all references and assignments of the variable in case statements, updates are performed using 'PyVerilog AST Update Functionality'.   
        
def transform_example():      // Transformation function  1/4 about transformation  part as per requirement. This could be anything from renaming states to rearranging logic blocks if you like and it depends on your requirements (like `oldprefix`,  `new prefix , etc.)    2nd of task description; this can also depend upon the actual use case or project's need
    parser = pyverilog.Parser()       // Initialize PyVerilog Parser  3rd part about parsing verilog code from file as per requirement, Here we are using it to parse a given Verilog source  into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)     4/5 of task description; This step is necessary for visiting the AST and making changes.
    ast = parser.parse('your_file')   // Parse verilog file as per requirement, Here we are using it to parse given Verilog source into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)     6/7 of task description; This step is necessary for visiting the AST and making changes    
    visitor = Visitor(oldprefix,'new_prefix')  // Initialize our custom object with required parameters as per requirement, Here we are creating a new instance based on given input. All methods will operate here because this class inherits from 'ExampleVisitor'  8/9 of task description; This is the point where all changes should be made to AST and then saved back into file or written out if required
    visitor.visit(ast)  // Visit our custom object with given parameters as per requirement, Here we are calling visit method which will traverse through tree structure in post-order manner (DFS for trees). It calls all children recursively on a node and then it does its job  9/10 of task description; This is the main point where changes made by our custom object should be saved back into file or written out if required
``` 
This code may need further modifications based upon your specific requirements. You might want to add error handling, logging capabilities as well for a more robust solution in production environment: `pyverilog`'s AST update functionality is very powerful and flexible but also requires some time due to the complexity it adds on top of standard Python string replacement operation (using regex).
