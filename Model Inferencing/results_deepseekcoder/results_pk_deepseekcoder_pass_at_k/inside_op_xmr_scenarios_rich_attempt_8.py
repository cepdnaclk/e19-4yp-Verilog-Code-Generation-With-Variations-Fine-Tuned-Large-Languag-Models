Here is an example of how you can create a Python module for your requirements using PyVerilog, re and argparse libraries in python to implement visitor pattern alongwith XMR scenarios (Cross-Module References Scenarios). 
You will need the pyverilog library which supports parsing Verilog into abstract syntax trees. The code below should give you a starting point for your requirements:

```python
import re, argparse
from ast import NodeVisitor, parse as p_ast
from xformframework._xforms  # replace with actual path to the XForm module in framework
# PyVerilog specifics and necessary modules go here. For instance you might need 'pyverilog' or a similar library for parsing Verilog into an AST, etc...  
import pyverilog as pv  # replace with actual path to the Python libray containing tools for working on verilogs (like ast) in this case. This may not be necessary depending upon your specific use cases and requirements of PyVerilog or Verilog itself). For instance, 'ast' module is usually part of standard python library
from xformframework import TransformationError  # replace with actual path to the error handling mechanism if any exists in framework (like raising exceptions)
# Parse AST using pyverilog and create visitor class. This could be done by subclassing NodeVisitor as shown below:  
import sys, os; print = None    ; exec('from __future__ import print_function')  # Pythonic way to redirect stdout for testing purposes (also known as redirection of console outputs) in this block and the end. This will make python output go directly into your standard out so you can see it right away while running tests or from within a script
sys.stdout = sys.__stdout__    # Restore original print function to do nothing for testing purposes (also known as redirection of console outputs) in this block and the end – Pythonic way, same reason above but here we restore std out before test run started by changing it back into standard output stream
class ExampleVisitor(NodeVisitor):    # Replace with actual class name that matches your requirements. You might need to extend NodeVistor or use some other base visitor subclasses depending on what is needed in the transformation process as per requirement below, for example rename all method calls and replace them accordingly
   def __init__(self , signal_name ):    # Replace with actual parameters if any changes are necessary. In your case these would be 'signal name' along others like self., etc... depending on what you need to store in the visitor class instance, for example a list of signals found and their modifications done
       pass     ;   def visit(self , node ):    # Replace with actual method if any changes are necessary. In your case this would be 'visit' along others like self., etc... depending on what you need to do in the transformation process as per requirement below, for example appending new signals found into a list and modifying nodes of tree according to findings
def transform_example(inputFile , outputPath ):    # Replace with actual parameters if any changes are necessary. This function will be responsible by parsing input file using pyverilog's parse method, creating visitor instance for it then performing transformations on the parsed AST and saving result back into outfile
```   In your command line tool you can create an argument parser as follows:    # Create argparse object to get inputs from user. This is a Pythonic way of doing this – replace 'my_program' with actual program name in below block, it should be replaced by the specific python file that contains `main` function
```python   if __name__ == "__main__":    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="A simple example for xform.") # Adding arguments as per requirements – replace 'xmr_signal' with actual parameter name and make sure to add all necessary parameters while calling `add` function
parser.add_argument('inputFile', type=str, help = "Input file that contains Verilog code")    parser.add_argument("outputPath",type= str ,help  ="Output path for transformed verilog files ") # Calling arguments as per requirements – replace 'xmr' with actual parameter name
args   = vars(parser.parse_args())   print (f"(*) Running on {os.__file__}")    runProgram = args['inputFile'] , outputPath  = os . path join (. abspath () .. " xformframework" ) # Include necessary imports and setup the arguements as per requirement, then call function to perform transformation
```   Make sure all your methods have docstrings explaining what they do.  Remember that you need a test-case for each functionality of XMR scenarios described in requirements block above (for example: handling virtual interfaces etc.) . You may also want additional error checking and exception management as per requirement or if the framework already provides such features, then utilize them directly to prevent unnecessary complexity into your code.
