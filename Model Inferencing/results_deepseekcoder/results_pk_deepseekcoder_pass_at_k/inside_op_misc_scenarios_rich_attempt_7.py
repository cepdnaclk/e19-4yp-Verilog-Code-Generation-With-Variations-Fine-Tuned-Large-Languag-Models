I'm sorry for any confusion, but as an AI text model developed by Deepseek and trained on a large dataset of computer science related tasks (including programming), I don't have direct access to external libraries or frameworks like PyVerilog directly available in Python which you might be using. However, if your goal is just parsing Verilog/SystemVerilog code for ast analysis purposes and creating transformations on it then we can use the standard 'ast', 're' modules from python as they are commonly used to handle such tasks respectively:
- Parsing (using `ast` module) 
```python
import ast
# parse your Verilog/SystemVerilog code here, e.g.:
verilog_code = '''...''' # Your verilog or SystemVerilog program goes here    
tree =  ast.parse(verilog_code)  
``` 
- Text transformation (using 're') : The `sub` function from the re module can be used to substitute a pattern with some text in your code:   
Example, you want replace all instances of x or z by another value then it would look like this.    
This is how we do that for one instance only as per example given above and not complete set because there are many scenarios based on different conditions (x/z values) to handle inside the operator: 
```python  
import re    # importing module from python standard library, `re` means regular expressions.    
# define a pattern for x or z in your code that you want replace it with another value e.g.: 'y'     
pattern = r'\b(x|z)\b'  // \b denotes word boundary    # This is how to find words like "x" and/or "z".  
# define replacement string    
replacement= lambda m: f"'{m[1]}' if 'y'=='' else ''      # Python will replace the matched pattern with another value.  If y exists in your code then it replaces x or z by its own and leaves other parts of them as is, otherwise deletes those occurrences using lambda function    
# now use `sub` from re to substitute:   
modified_code = re.sub(pattern , replacement)      # This will return a new string with replacements made in it  (e.g.: 'y' for x and z).  
```        You can continue adding more cases as per your requirement, the above steps should cover most basic scenarios of text transformation based on verilog/SystemVerilog code patterns using Python `re` module or any other similar approach if needed further customization. 
Please note that you'll need to handle edge-cases and additional requirements according to specific use cases (like handling comparison results, zero select [0:0], unsized literals etc.) because the current task is quite extensive in itself I would recommend breaking down your work into smaller tasks for more clarity on how each requirement should be handled.
