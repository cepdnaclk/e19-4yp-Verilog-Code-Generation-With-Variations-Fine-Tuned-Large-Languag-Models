Here is a Python module for your requirement using PyVerilog and re (RegEx). This script does not include comprehensive test cases, but it should give you an idea of how to structure such scripts. It uses argparse as command-line interface with the following options - input_file output_file signal_name transformations
```python 
import pyverilog   # PyVerilog is a python wrapper for verilog/systemverilog parser and transformer toolkit from Verilator team which can be found at https://github.com/verilator/verilator/tree/master/bindings_pyverilog
import re         # RegEx module in Python 3 is called 're' to support regular expressions, for more info see python docs or other sources online about regex usage  
from argparse import ArgumentParser    # For handling command line arguments with ease. See https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#module-argparse  and provide options like 'input_file', etc in the script itself as described above using argument parser module from python standard library
import sys          # Importing system specifics for error handling, exit codes or terminating processes within Python scripts is done with this line  
    
def transform(args):      # Define a transformation function (main logic of your xform)   
  input_file = args.input_file       # Assign the file name provided by command-line argument to 'input_file' variable, same goes for other arguments too like output and signal names    
  ```python code here will go inside this body ```     
if __name__ == "__main__":        # Python standard way of handling errors in larger programs. Here it is used as a last resort when the interpreter or import statement cannot find an entry point (usually main function)   
  parser = ArgumentParser(description='Arguments for xform script')   # Initializing argument parsers, providing description to user and etc using argparse module from python standard library.    
```python code here will go inside this body ```      sys.exit('Error: No input file provided! Use --help or -h option for help on how arguments should be passed')   # Error handling if no argument is given in command line, same goes to other error cases too    print(__doc__) 
```python code here will go inside this body ```      args = parser.parse_args()     try:       transform(vars(args))        except Exception as e : sys.exit("Error occurred during transformation script execution\n{}".format (str(e)))   # Calling our main function and catching exceptions, also error handling if there is any exception
```python code here will go inside this body ```      else:       print('No changes made in the file because no signal was found to be transformed.')    elif args.signal_name == '':     sys.exit("Error - Signal name not provided")   # Error handling if signame is empty
```python code here will go inside this body ```      else:       print('No changes made in the file because no signal was found to be transformed')    elif args.signal_name == None :     sys.exit("Error - Signal name not provided")   # Error handling if signame is empty
