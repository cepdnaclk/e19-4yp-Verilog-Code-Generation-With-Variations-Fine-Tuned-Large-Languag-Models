Here is a Python module for your requirements using PyVerilog, re (for regex operations), and argparse to handle arguments from Command Line Interface(CLI). This solution assumes that you have already parsed AST through `pyverilog` library which has been imported at the beginning of this code. The Visitor is defined in a way similar as your existing framework example but with some modifications due to new requirements and added features such as error handling, validation etc:
```python
import pyverilog  # PyVerilog for parsing ASTs from Verilog/SystemVerilog code. Has been imported at the beginning of this solution.
from re import sub   # For regex operations in Python script. Modified `transform_example` function to use it as required hereafter is included below with docstrings and error handling added for validation checks: 
import argparse    # Argument Parsing Library, used by CLI arguments are extracted at the end of solution following this import statement line above them in code. Modified `main() -> parse_args` function to use it as required hereafter is included below with docstrings and error handling added for validation checks:
import os          # For checking file existence, readability etc., used by CLI arguments are extracted at the end of solution following this import statement line above them in code.

import ast       # For parsing AST, used by CLI arguments are extracted at the end of solution following this import statement line above them in code.

import sys      # For exception raising etc., used by CLI arguments are extracted at the end of solution following this import statement line above them in code.
