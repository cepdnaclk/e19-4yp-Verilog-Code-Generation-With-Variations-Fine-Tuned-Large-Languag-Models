Here is a Python module for your requirement using `pyverilog` to parse and analyze an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of Verilog, creating another visitor class that follows from our current pattern implementation in order to perform text transformations on signals found within the AST after parsing. 

Please note this code is a simplified version for demonstration purposes only because it's quite complex with all these features and more details are needed about how exactly your framework works, etc... Also `pyverilog` needs Python3 or above versions which isn't available in python2 yet but I will be adding the necessary changes to accommodate this.
```python 
import argparse
from pyverilog import parse_file as pvf
# Your visitor class should inherit from our pattern implementation here... (I can provide a skeleton)
class ExampleVisitor(object): # your existing code goes in here..  
    def __init__(self, signalName): 
        self.signal = None          
        
def visitNode_(node_instance: pvf._AbstractVerilogASTSubstitutionRulesetting) -> bool :     
       if isInstance( node_, Node ) or hasattr (item , 'name') and item . name == signalName_:  # your check for target declarations here...  
            self.signal_found = True                     
           changesMade_.append ('Found {0}'.format_(self.signallename))    
       return False    def visit(node):             
        if isinstance ( node, Node) :  # your check for target declarations here...   ,for c in self._childrens_:         visitor .visit_ _c_)         
```                  
def transformFunction_(inputFile: str = None, outputfile=None, signalName):       def main():      parser.addArgument ('signalname')     args_.parseArgs(args)        if not input file or (not out put File and the arguments is none), print ("Please provide proper inputs") return 0  
```python          # Main function that calls other functions to do your transformations...    def _childrens_(self): pass      class parser:         args = None           addArgument=add_argument            description   = "This script does stuff"        parseArgs(args)     if not inputFile or (not outPutfile and the arguments is none), print ("Please provide proper inputs") return 0
