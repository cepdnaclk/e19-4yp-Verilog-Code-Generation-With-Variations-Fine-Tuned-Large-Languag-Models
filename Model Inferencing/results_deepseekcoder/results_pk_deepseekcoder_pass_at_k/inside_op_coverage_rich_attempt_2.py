For generating coverage test cases for inside operator, we can use PyVerilog's `ast` module to parse and analyze a Verilog/SystemVerilog file using Python scripts instead of directly parsing it as an AST in SystemVerilog (which is not supported by pyverilog). 

Here are the necessary modules:
- re for regular expressions, string operations etc.
```python
import argparse
from random import randint
# Add more required libraries here if needed... e.g., unittest in Python's standard library to create test cases and coverage points can be added using pytest framework or similar tools provided by your testing toolkit (like nose, behave) 
```
Here is the code:
- A visitor class that uses PyVerilog for parsing Verilog/SystemVerilog files. The Python script should include necessary imports and a `visit` method to identify target elements in nodes of parsed tree or file content respectively based on your requirement (e.g., inside operator). 
- A main transformation function that uses visitors defined above for parsing Verilog/SystemVerilog files, performing transformations as required by the problem statement and validating results using assertions to check if it matches expected outputs in case of positive tests or error conditions otherwise fail with appropriate message. This can be done within a try-except block around your transformation code that calls pyverilog parsing functions (e.g., `ast`, etc.)
```python
def test_transformation():  # Main function to invoke the transformations... e.g.: def main(args): ... return run() end } in C++ or similar languages would be a good start for this task as it will allow you control over command line arguments and can also handle unforeseen errors that may occur during execution
```  
- A CLI (commandline interface) using argparse library to accept inputs from user. You need at least one argument `input_file` which is the Verilog/SystemVerilog file you want transformations on, possibly along with other arguments if needed like test cases or output files etc., and another optional flag for testing mode (e.g.: -t)
```python 
def main():   # Function to parse args from command line into argparse ArgumentParser() object... e.g: parser =argparse .ArgumentParser(description='My script') ... add_argument('file', metavar’‘, type：str，help': 'Input Verilog/SystemVerilog file path)
``` 
- Docstrings to explain how the code works and provide examples. Include edge cases in your test case generation where required by pyverigl's documentation about operators... e.g.: `ast` module or related functions may have additional docstring details, including example tests etc., explaining their functionality/behavior
- Adding comprehensive error handling around the code blocks that use PyVerilog parsing and transformations for better exception raising mechanism in case of failures due to unforeseen reasons (e.g.: if not os.path.exists(args.file): raise Exception('Input file doesnot exist'))  etc., providing appropriate messages, or fail with exit codes on failure
- Provide comprehensive error handling around the code blocks that include transformations and assertions for better exception raising mechanism in case of failures due to incorrect inputs (e.g.: if not isinstance(args.file , str): raise Exception('Input file path should be a string'))  etc., providing appropriate messages, or fail with exit codes on failure
