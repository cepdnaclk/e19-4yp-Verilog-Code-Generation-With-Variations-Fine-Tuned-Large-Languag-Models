Here's a Python module for your requirements using PyVerilog and Regex (based on provided examples). This script will parse an input Verilog file, apply transformations according to given parameters in command line arguments or through environment variables if defined by pyverilotools/pv_env.py library.
Note that the actual transformation is performed manually as it requires knowledge about how your codebase and xform framework work (i.e., declaring a new operator, changing signal names). I have added comments to explain what each section does:
```python
# Required libraries/modules ------------------------------------------- #
import os
from pyverilog import Verilog, load_file as vload, pvlinting  
from re import sub     // Regex for text transformations   
from argparse import ArgumentParser      // Command-line interface library       
# -------------------------------------------------------------------- # 

class ExampleVisitor(Verilog.Node):           // Visiting and transforming AST using PyVerilog's visitor pattern      
   def __init__(self, signal_name=None) :    
    self._signal = []                         ///< Signal list for changes made during visitation     
         if isinstance(node , Node):            // Check node type (only decl/assign needed here as per requirement. 
          # Perform transformations...           --->  You should replace with your actual transformation logic  
    def visit_NodeChildrens() :                 ///< Visit and transform children nodes of the current one     ----> Implement in visitor class according to xforms requirements     
def main():                                   // Main function for command-line interface        
  parser = ArgumentParser(description='PyVerilog Transform')   --->  Define a description, help message etc. with argparse   
# -------------------------------------------------------------------- #    
```            
The following is an example of how the visitor class can be implemented:
This should replace `pass` in your actual transformation logic as per requirement documentation above for each new operator you want to create or existing signal names need changes according xform framework's rules. The main function will take care about command line arguments, environment variables and use pyverilotools/pv_env library:
```python
def transform(inputfile , outputfile = None):  // Transformation Main Function       --> Implement your transformation logic here  
    if not isinstance((node), Node) :            --->  Perform error handling for input file, it should be a Verilog AST as per requirement.     If node type matches the expected pattern then proceed with transforming and validation else return False or throw an exception      // Implement your own checks here based on requirements 
    if not outputfile :                           --->  Define default values (if any) for input file, it should be a Verilog AST as per requirement.     If no defined in command line arguments then open the files and do transformations else write to new opened or existing one   // Implement your own checks here based on requirements
    return True                                  --->  Return true if transformation is successful otherwise false      // The logic should be implemented according with xform framework's rules.  In case of failure, it will raise an exception as per requirement documentation above     --> If any error occurs during the transformations then this function must handle that and throw appropriate exceptions
```            
In addition to these points in your requirements:   // The logic should be implemented according with xform framework's rules.  In case of failure, it will raise an exception as per requirement documentation above     --> If any error occurs during the transformations then this function must handle that and throw appropriate exceptions      ---->  Implement all functionalities you mentioned in requirements using pyverilog AST (using visitor pattern), command-line arguments based or environment variables.
