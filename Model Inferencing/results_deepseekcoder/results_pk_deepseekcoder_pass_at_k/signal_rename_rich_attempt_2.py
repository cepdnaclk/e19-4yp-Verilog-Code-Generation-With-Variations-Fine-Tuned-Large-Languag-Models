You have a requirement for an advanced Python script which includes parsing Verilog/SystemVerilog and transforming it using regular expressions (regex). Pyverilog is not built into python, so you'll need to install this library separately via pip or conda if necessary. Also note that the existing xform framework patterns are used as a reference for creating your own visitor class in Python which could be different from standard ones provided by libraries like pyparsing and ply (for parsers).

Here is an example of how you can create such module: 
```python
import argparse
from collections import namedtuple
try: # For python3.x, use built-in exception handling instead os reraise Exception("...") to catch specific exceptions in the same way as a normal Python error message would be printed out by sys.exc_info()[2] (the traceback object).  Use "Exception" for catching all types of errors
    from pyverilog import parse, transform # Importing PyVerilog's functions so they can handle Verilog code properly and raise exceptions when something goes wrong due to parsing or transformation.  
except Exception:    
      print("PyVerilog library not found in your environment.") 
try:   
    import re      
except ImportError as e : # Catching specific error for missing modules/packages, you can add more exceptions based on the requirements and use them accordingly (Import Error , ModuleNotFound etc.)    
      print("Module {0} not found in your environment. Please install it using pip or conda." .format(e)) 
      
class SignalRenameVisitor: # Define a visitor class that will be used to find all occurrences of the signal and replace them with new names, extend from existing xforms if necessary (Example Visitors).  
    def __init__(self , old_name : str ,new_name ):     self.old_name = re.compile(r'\b' + rf"{re.escape(old_name)}"  + r'\b', re.IGNORECASE)      # Compile regex patterns for the signals to be matched and set them as instance variables (pattern, new name). 

        self._changes = []         def visit(self , node):    pass     if isinstance(node,.NodeTypeHere):          [...]            else:           return   from pyverilog import transform # Use PyVerilog's transformation functions to do the actual text transformations.      with open (input_file, "r") as f : content  str =f .read()         modifiedContent=transform(self._oldToNewPattern().sub,(content))       ...   def _oldToNewPattern():        return r"(?i)("+ self._signal + ") (\w*)"     if __name__ == "__main__" :    parser =  argparse.ArgumentParser()      ......
