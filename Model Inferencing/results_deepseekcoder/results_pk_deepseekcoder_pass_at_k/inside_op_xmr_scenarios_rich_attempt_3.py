Here's a Python module for your requirements using PyVerilog and regex transformations, along with argparse to handle CLI arguments.: 
```python
import pyverilog as pv
from re import sub
import sys
import os
sys.path.append(os.getcwd()) #add current directory in path for verilog parsing via PyVerilog's parse method which expects a list of files or directories, not just one file at the time 
                           #So we add it using this line to make sure that our code can be used with xform framework. You need pyverigod installed and working in your environment otherwise you may face errors while parsing verilog into ast object (use pip install git+https://github.com/kylemanna/pyverilog)
                           #Also make sure to handle the error properly as per requirements of this task, which is not covered here due to complexity and specifics 
                           
class ExampleVisitor(pv.NodeBasedTraverser):   //PyVerilog's Node Based traverse class (Inheriting from pv) that can be used for visiting the nodes in your AST object created by pyverigod parse method of verilog files 
    def __init__(self, signal_name):       /*Initializing visitor with a target name */  
        self.signal_found = False          //Flag to check if any signals are found on current node or not     
	def visit(self ,node : pv.Node) -> None:  /Visiting method overridden from PyVerilog's NodeBasedTraverser class, which allows us to perform certain operations for each type of verilog nodes   //This is where you add your transformations on current node
	def visit_end(self ,node : pv.Node) -> None:  /End visiting method same as above but called at the end after all children have been visited, useful to perform clean-up operations such log or save files etc   //This is where you add your logging of changes made in current node
def transform_example(inputfile : str , outputdir :str = None) -> bool:  /*Transformation function which takes input file and an optional directory for storing outputs*/    /Using pyverigod's parse method to generate AST object from verilog files, this is where you perform your transformations on that ast generated by parsing
	with open(inputfile , 'r') as f : content  /*Reading the input file */     //This line reads contents of given Verilog source code into a string for further processing   /Using Python's built-in with statement to read files and perform transformations on them. This is where you add your regex operations
	modified_content = sub(pattern, replacement , content)  /* Using pythonâ€™s inbuilt re module 'sub', replacing all occurrences of a pattern within the file */   //This line replaces contents based upon given patterns and replaced values which are provided by user or default if not specified.
	with open (os.path.join(outputdir , os.path.basename(inputfile)),'w') as f :  /* Writing modified content to a new file in output directory */   //This line writes the transformed contents back into files inside given directories provided by user or default if not specified
	return self.signal_found    /Returning whether any signal has been found on current node after performing transformations, useful for checking success of transformation process  This is where you add your logging and error handling code   //This line will return True/False based upon changes made in the file (if no change happened then False else true)
```    
The command-line interface can be set up using argparse:   ``python -m example --file=<input_verilog> [--outputdir=out]`  where `example.py` is your Python script and you may specify input verilog file, output directory (default current folder), etc., depending on the requirements of this task
```   //This line uses argparse module to get command-line arguments while running python example. pyverigod's parse method will automatically handle parsing Verilog files into AST objects and transformations can be performed upon these ast generated by verilogs  file content in given input_file is read, then the matched patterns are replaced based on provided or default values depending if not specified . Output modifications (if any) would store back to a new output directory/files
