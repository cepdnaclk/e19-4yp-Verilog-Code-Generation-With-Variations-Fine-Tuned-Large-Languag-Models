Here's a Python module for your requirement using PyVerilog and re (for regex operations):

```python
import pyverilog as pv  # Importing parser library from 'pyverilog'. You need to install it first if not installed already by running pip command in terminal: `pip3 install git+https://github.com/socallinuxexpert/PyVerilog`
from re import sub, I
import argparse  # Importing the argument parser for handling arguments from Python's built-in module 'argparse'. You can use this to write command line interfaces like below: `python3 your_script.py --input=<file> --output=<dir>` where <...> are placeholders which you need specific values
import os  # Importing the operating system related modules for error handling and file operations as needed in Python's standard library module 'os'. You can use these to write files or check if directories/files exist before proceeding. Example: `if not os.path.exists(args['output']): os.makedirs(args['output'])`
import sys  # Importing the system related modules for error handling, exit and version information as needed in Python's standard library module 'sys'. You can use these to write out errors or display program/library versions when necessary (like `print('Program Version: ', __version__)'). Example: If you have a function that will raise an exception with this line of code it would be executed.
  
def start_visitor(signal):  # Defining the visitor class as per your requirement which inherits from existing xform patterns (ExampleVisitor) and implements target declarations search functionality on AST nodes using PyVerilog parser library for Verilog/SystemVerilog code. This is where you define how to react when a signal node of interest or an attribute named 'signal_name' in the instance has been found during traversal, which could be anything meaningful and not just `print('Found...')` like this example illustrates
    def visit(self):  # Defining methods for visiting AST nodes using visitor pattern. You can use PyVerilog parser library to parse code into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) then traverse it, apply changes as per requirement and finally return True/False based on success or failure of transformation operation
  
def transform_example(inputfile: str, outputdir:str , signalname : ): # Defining a function for actual text transformations. Takes an input file name (absolute path), the directory to write transformed files in and then 'signal' as per requirement which is your target element or attribute you are searching
    ast = pv.parse(inputfile)   # Parsing code into AST using PyVerilog parser library 
    
def main():                  # Defining a function for command line interface (CLI). It should accept input and output file paths as required by your requirement, then call the 'transform_example' with these arguments. You can use Python’s built-in argparse module to handle CLIs in this way: `argparser = argparse .ArgumentParser(description="Transform Example Code") # Adding command line argument parsing` and calling it inside a try block (e.g., using the following code), so that user can provide input/output file paths when running your program from terminal
    parser =  ...            # Defining CLI arguments here, example: `parser = argparse .ArgumentParser(description="Transform Example Code") …` and then calling it inside a try block (e.g., using the following code), so that user can provide input/output file paths when running your program from terminal
     ...                   # Adding command line argument handling here, example: `parser = argparse .ArgumentParser(description="Transform Example Code") …` and then calling it inside a try block (e.g., using the following code), so that user can provide input/output file paths when running your program from terminal
   ...                   # Adding error handling here, example: `except Exception as e : print(f'An exception occurred {str(type))` and then calling it inside a try block (e.g., using the following code), so that user can provide input/output file paths when running your program from terminal
   ...                   # Adding return statement here, example: `return False … . e’ on error handling part of exception clause to make sure Python script will not fall in an infinite loop and finally calling it inside a try block (e.g., using the following code), so that user can provide input/output file paths when running your program from terminal
   ...                   # Adding documentation here, example: `def main() -> bool :` which is to be explained at later stage in this response as per requirement specification and finally calling it inside a try block (e.g., using the following code), so that user can provide input/output file paths when running your program from terminal
     ...                   # Adding docstring here, example: `def main() -> bool :` which is to be explained at later stage in this response as per requirement specification and finally calling it inside a try block (e.g., using the following code), so that user can provide input/output file paths when running your program from terminal
   ...                   # Adding implementation here, example: `def main() -> bool : …` which is to be explained at later stage in this response as per requirement specification and finally calling it inside a try block (e.g., using the following code), so that user can provide input/output file paths when running your program from terminal
