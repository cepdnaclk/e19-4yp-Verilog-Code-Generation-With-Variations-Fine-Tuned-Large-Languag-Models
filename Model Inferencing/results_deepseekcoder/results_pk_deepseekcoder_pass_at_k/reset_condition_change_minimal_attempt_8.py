Here is a simplified version of how you could implement this task in Python using pyverilog for parsing and analysis, regex to change reset conditions as well error handling mechanism based on provided requirements (assuming that all inputs are valid).  It's important not to forget about comprehensive docstrings. Also be aware the code below is a simplified version of what you could achieve with such task so it may need adjustments for your actual use case:
```python
import pyverilog as pv
from verilog_ast import VerilogModule, IfStatement  # Assuming that we have this module available. You'd likely want to replace these classes/methods accordingly based on the structure of AST you are working with in your specific case.  
import re
import argparse
# Importing necessary modules for command line interface and argument handling:
parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()  # Creates a new Argument Parser object which can read input from CLI/terminal (optional)..
group1 = parser.add_argument_group('Required arguments')  	# Required group of args with specific namespaces for better clarity in the help message...    	                                                                                                        .help='Allows users to set reset condition as active-high or vice versa.'  # Adds a new argument and associates it with variable.
args = parser.parse_args()  	# Parses arguments passed into script..   		      	    ,type is not required if you are using built in args, but useful for custom defined types...    	                                                      .add_argument('--rst', choices=['high','low'], default='high')  # Adds a new argument and associates it with variable.
# The above code will set the reset condition as 'active- high'. If you want to change this, simply adjust choice in argparse:    		            .add_argument('--rst', choices=['high','low'], default='high')  # Adds a new argument and associates it with variable.
```python	  			            					                                                                                           `   				      	 	    pv.__version__, re., argparse.]]])]]]))))]. This is just to make sure all necessary modules are imported correctly.. I also have not included any error handling or validation based on the requirements provided but you would need additional code in your final implementation.
