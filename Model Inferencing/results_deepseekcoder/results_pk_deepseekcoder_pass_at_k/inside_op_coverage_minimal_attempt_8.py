Here is an example of how you can implement this task using Python and PyVerilog library, which allows parsing Verilog source files into Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs). Note that generating coverage test cases for inside operator requires a more complex solution than the simple code provided here. 

This script will take in an input file as argument from command line:
```python
import argparse
from pyverilog import parse_file, VerilogError, ModuleKind

def main():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Process some integers.')
    parser.add_argument('filename', type=str, help='input file name to process in verilog source code format')
    
    args = parser.parse_args()
  
    try:  # attempt parsing the input Verilog module into ASTs and then analyze them using visitors/xforms if necessary
        asts, _  = parse_file(filename=args.filename)     
        
       # iterate over each tree in parsed file; you can use visitor or xform to transform these trees depending on your requirements 
    except VerilogError as e:  
     print('Failed parsing the input verilog source code')         
        return False                 
          
if __name__ == "__main__":       # run main function only if running directly, not in some imported module     
         main()                   
``` 
This script will parse a Verilog file and then analyze each tree (in this case the ASTs) using visitors or xforms. Note that you would need to implement your own visitor/xform pattern here which could be as simple as visiting every node in an expression, checking if it is inside another operator's operand etc., depending on what kind of transformations are required for each specific type of nodes and expressions within the Verilog source code.
