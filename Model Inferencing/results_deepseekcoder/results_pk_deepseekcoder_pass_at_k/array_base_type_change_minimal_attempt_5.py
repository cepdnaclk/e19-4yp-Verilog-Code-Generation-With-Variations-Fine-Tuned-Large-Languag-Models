Sure, I can provide a basic skeleton of how you could structure this in Python using PyVerilog for parsing and analyzing Verilog ASTs (Abstract Syntax Trees). However please note that it'll be highly dependent on your exact use case as the transformation logic will vary greatly. 

```python
import pyverilog
from xform import Transformation, VisitResultType   # existing transformer library in python you can refer to them for understanding how they work and extending their functionality yourself or using pre-existing libraries like astunparser etc (refer the AST unparsing part)  . This will be your starting point.
import re    # standard Python module of regular expressions related operations  
from argparse import ArgumentParser     # built in argument parsers for command line arguments, you can use them to define and handle user inputs as per requirement (file_name -> input file etc)  . This will be your starting point.
import sys    # standard Python module which provides functions connecting with the system API like exit() function call when an error occurs during execution of code are handled here, you can use them to provide more information about errors such as return codes or logs (for debugging purpose).   this is also where PyVerilog will load your verilog file.
import ast    # standard Python module for parsing and traversing the abstract syntax tree used by pyverilog parser , it can be useful to understand how ASTs are structured, but mainly you'll use these methods in order not only parse a string or read from files like xform part is doing.
import inspect    # standard Python module that gets information about current frame and provides more details related with calls (arguments etc). This will help us for debugging our code when there are errors/exceptions occur during execution of the transformations in visitor classes .  this would be done by calling `inspect` on an object.
import pdb    # Python module providing a breakpoint-driven development environment, you can use it to inspect variables values or modify them at runtime and so forth (for debugging purpose). This is used for handling errors during execution of code .  this would be done by calling `pdb` on an object.
```  
Here's how the visitor class could look like:   
You can start with a basic visit function that prints out something to show it works, and then you will extend from XformVisitor in order not only perform your transformations but also keep track of visited nodes/elements . This is where regex matching would be useful.  And finally the main xformation could look like:
```python  
class ArrayTypeReplacer(XFormTrans):    # Inheritance and specifics from existing transformer library in python, you should replace XformVisitor with your actual visitor class name here . This will serve as a base for transformation module. It can be extended further according to what needs change is done on array declaration
```  And the main command line interface would look like:   (for example)    :
 ```python     parser = ArgumentParser(description='Transform Verilog files') # Creating argparse object for handling user inputs. This can be extended according to your requirement, e.g., file names , etc .  this is where you specify arguments that the program should expect from command line when called like -i input_file
```   After parsing and analyzing Verilog code using PyVerilog library by passing it as a string argument then call main transformation function which will handle all transformations. This can be done in following way:  (for example)    :     parser = ArgumentParser(description='Transform Verilog files')
```python   if __name__ == '__main__': # defining entry point of the program, this is where our main function would start from . It should handle command line arguments and call appropriate transformation method.  This can be extended according to requirement like verifying user input etc., e.g.:    def verify_input(args):   pass
```python     if __name__ == '__main__': # defining entry point of the program, this is where our main function would start from . It should handle command line arguments and call appropriate transformation method  This can be extended according to requirement like verifying user input etc., e.g.:    def verify_input(args):   pass
