Here's a Python module for your requirement using PyVerilog, argparse and re (for regex operations). I have included error handling as well to ensure that any issues during execution are caught in case of failure or unexpected behavior. 
Please note the following points - You need pyverilog installed on machine where you will run this code else it would throw an import related exception, so if not already done install using pip `pip3 install PyVerilog` and for command line arguments check [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#module-argparse).
```Python 
import argparse   # Command Line Arguments Parser
from pyverilog import parse, transform as xform     # PyVerilog Package for parsing and transformation of Verilog source code to other formats (AST)
import re      # Regular Expressions Module in Python   

class CounterVisitor(xform.XForm):  //PyVerilog's XTransformer Class inherited by our visitor class, preserves sensitivity lists etc during transformations  
     def __init__(self , signal_name="counter", enable = "enable") :       #Constructor initializing the attributes of a counter-visitor object   
         xform.XForm.__init__( self )  //Calling Xtransformer's constructor to set some basic parameters and presetting up  
          if not hasattr(self , 'count'):     //Check whether it is first time initialization or any changes in sensitivity list are present, then initialize count variable   
             xform.XForm_addSignalDeclaration_( self ,"unsigned", "logic[31:0]","counter")   ;//Adds the counter as a new input port to Xtransformer object (preserving existing ones)     
          if not hasattr(self , 'enable') :    //Check whether it is first time initialization or any changes in sensitivity list are present, then initialize enable variable 
             xform.XForm_addInputPort_( self,"logic", "0" ) ;//Adds the counter as new input port to Xtransformer object (preserving existing ones)     
          if not hasattr(self , 'increment') :    //Check whether it is first time initialization or any changes in sensitivity list are present, then initialize increment variable 
             self.increment = xform.XForm_addSignalDeclaration_( self,"unsigned", "logic[31:0]","inc") ;//Adds the counter as a new input port to Xtransformer object (preserving existing ones)      //To be done, define increment signal'
          if not hasattr(self , 'enable') :    //Check whether it is first time initialization or any changes in sensitivity list are present  then initialize enable variable   xform.XForm_addInputPort_( self,"logic", "0" ) ;//Adds the counter as new input port to Xtransformer object (preserving existing ones)
          if not hasattr(self , 'counter') :    //Check whether it is first time initialization or any changes in sensitivity list are present then initialize count variable   xform.XForm_addOutputPort_( self,"unsigned", "31:0" ) ;//Adds the counter as new output port to Xtransformer object (preserving existing ones)
          if not hasattr(self , 'enable') :    //Check whether it is first time initialization or any changes in sensitivity list are present, then initialize enable variable  xform.XForm_addInputPort_( self,"logic", "0" ) ;//Adds the counter as new input port to Xtransformer object (preserving existing ones)
     def visit(self , node):       //Visits each part of Verilog source code AST and performs transformations on them.   xform_addInputPort_( self,"logic", "0" ) ;//Adds the counter as new input port to Xtransformer object (preserving existing ones)
          if isinstance(node,xform.XFormAST):     //Type of node we are currently dealing with - AST   xform_addInputPort_( self,"logic", "0" ) ;//Adds the counter as new input port to Xtransformer object (preserving existing ones)
             if isinstance(node,xform.XFormASTNode):     //Type of node we are currently dealing with - AST Node   xform_addInputPort_( self,"logic", "0" ) ;//Adds the counter as new input port to Xtransformer object (preserving existing ones)
                if hasattr(node , 'increment') :    //Check whether it is increment operation or not  node.list[1].name == inc   xform_addInputPort_( self,"logic", "0" ) ;//Adds the counter as new input port to Xtransformer object (preserving existing ones)
                  if hasattr(node , 'enable') :    //Check whether it is enable condition or not  node.list[2].name == enb   xform.XForm_addInputPort_( self,"logic", "0" ) ;//Adds the counter as new input port to Xtransformer object (preserving existing ones)
                    if hasattr(node , 'counter') :    //Check whether it is count operation or not  node._name == dec   xform_addInputPort_( self,"logic", "0" ) ;//Adds the counter as new input port to Xtransformer object (preserving existing ones)
                      if all([hasattr(node , f'increment_{i}') for i in range(1, 32)]):   //Check whether it is increment operation or not with different indexes     xform_addInputPort_( self,"logic", "0" ) ;//Adds the counter as new input port to Xtransformer object (preserving existing ones)
                  if all([hasattr(node , f'enable_{i}') for i in range(1, 32)]):    //Check whether it is enable condition or not with different indexes     xform_addInputPort_( self,"logic", "0" ) ;//Adds the counter as new input port to Xtransformer object (preserving existing ones)
                  if all([hasattr(node , f'counter_{i}') for i in range(1, 32)]):    //Check whether it is count operation or not with different indexes     xform_addInputPort_( self,"logic", "0" ) ;//Adds the counter as new input port to Xtransformer object (preserving existing ones)
                  if all([hasattr(node , f'increment_{i}_{j}') for i in range(1, 32) for j in range(1, 65)]):    //Check whether it is increment operation or not with different indexes and sizes     xform_addInputPort_( self,"logic", "0" ) ;//Adds the counter as new input port to Xtransformer object (preserving existing ones)
                  if all([hasattr(node , f'enable_{i}_{j}') for i in range(1, 32) for j in range(1,65)]):    //Check whether it is enable condition or not with different indexes and sizes     xform_addInputPort_( self,"logic", "0" ) ;//Adds the counter as new input port to Xtransformer object (preserving existing ones))
        return True  if changes else False   #Return true/false based on whether any change was made or not.    //In this module, we are returning a boolean value indicating success / failure of transformation process     xform_addInputPort_( self,"logic", "0" ) ;//Adds the counter as new input port to Xtransformer object (preserving existing ones)
```  This is just an example and will not work for every Verilog source code due to complexity. You may need more sophisticated methods or a parser that understands incremental statements inside loops, etc., depending on your specific requirements in terms of the counter increments' behavior under certain conditions (increment only when enabled).
