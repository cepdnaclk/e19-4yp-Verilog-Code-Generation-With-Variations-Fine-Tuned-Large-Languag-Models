Here's a basic example of how you could implement this in Python using argparse for CLI and pyverilog to parse Verilog AST, regexpand as an alternative syntax parser etc.: 
```python
import re
from collections import defaultdict    # For handling complex MDA specifications dynamically.
# Import necessary modules from the existing xform framework patterns: argparse for CLI and pyverilog to parse Verilog AST, regexpand as a regular expression parser etc.: 
"""You need install required packages beforehand using pip."""     #TODO add installation instructions after imports.   
from ast import NodeTransformer     
import sys                       
sys.path.append('./pyverilog')   # Add the pyVerilog's root directory to python path  so that we can use it without changing working dir in verilog parser module, you need make sure your current workdir is this folder or change accordingly when importing modules from other directories using relative paths.
from ast_tools                  as at   # Provides tools for parsing and visualizing ASTs  (pyverilog/ast)     , we use it to parse the Verilog source code into an abstract syntax tree, then walk that Tree looking specifically at xform nodes which are converted by our visitor.
from verilog_parser            as vp   # Provides tools for parsing and visualizing VERILOG (verilog-lang) files  , we use it to parse the Verilog source code into an abstract syntax tree, then walk that Tree looking specifically at xform nodes which are converted by our visitor.
from re_tools                   as rt   # Provides tools for working with regular expressions and strings in Python (regexpand). We will be using this module to parse the complex MDA specifications from Verilog code into a more pythonic structure that can handle dynamic arrays, fixed-size multi dimensional array types etc.
from xform_base                 as db   # Provides base for all transformations  , we use it in our visitor class and also provides common functionality such errors handling among others (xforms) . You need to define this module after pyverilog's ast, verilog parser modules but before argparse so that they are aware of the cli options.
from xform_visitor              as vc   # Provides visitor class for all transformations  , we use it in our main transformation function and also provide functionality like error handling among others (xforms) . You need to define this module after pyverilog's ast, verilog parser modules but before argparse so that they are aware of the cli options.
"""   #TODO: Add required packages list as a string here or in another file if you want more control over importing them into your project and ensure necessary dependencies for each module were installed properly (pip install ...).  Also, add instructions to run tests after adding these modules/dependencies etc., like pytest.
# This is just the start of what we need but there are many other things that you would also want in a fully functional transformation tool such as support for more types and complex MDA specifications (e.g: associative, queue), advanced error handling among others...  You can add these features by extending this basic example or creating new modules/classes etc., according to your specific needs
