Here's a simplified version of how you could structure such an application using Python and pyverilog for parsing Verilog syntax, argparse to handle command line arguments, regex for text transformation etc.: 
```python
import re
from abc import ABCMeta, abstractmethod
argparser = ... # initialize your parser here. For example: ArgumentParser() from argparse module in python3
class XForm(metaclass=ABCMeta):    
    @abstractmethod        
    def convert_node(self, node) -> bool : pass 
def main():       
      args = vars(argparser.parse_args())      
      xform  = ... # initialize your transformation here using given arguments (e.g., XFormVerilogSyntax). For example: YourXForm()  
         if not all([hasattr(xform, attr) for attr in ['convert','ast']]):  raise Exception('No AST or no convert method')     
       print ('Starting transformation...' )        xform.start_transformation()    # main processing loop starts here         
def start():         ...# you need to implement your own code starting the conversion from a source file (e.g., verilog parser)  and call 'main'. For example: XFormVerilogSyntax().convert(args['file'])        def convert_node() -> bool :... # fill in this method with actual implementation based on Verilog/Systemverilog rules
if __name__ == "__main__":    main()       else ...  // if not a module, run as standalone program           xform = YourXForm().convert(args['file'])        print ('End of transformation' )      # Ending process end here.  ``` Note: This is an example and may require modifications to meet your specific requirements such as handling different key types or multidimensional arrays, error checking etc., Also you need a proper implementation for the visitor pattern which inherits from XForm class (abstract method convert_node) 
This script does not provide full functionality of xform framework. You should adapt it to your needs and then extend its capabilities by adding more methods according to verilog/systemverilog syntax rules like handling arrays, looping constructs etc., or providing additional features such as signal type conversion between Verilog'93 (RTL) / SystemVerilogâ€™18+.
