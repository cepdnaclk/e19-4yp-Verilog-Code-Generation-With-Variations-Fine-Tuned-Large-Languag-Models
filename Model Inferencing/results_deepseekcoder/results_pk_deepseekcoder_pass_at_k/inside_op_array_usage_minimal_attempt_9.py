Here is a basic implementation of your requirement using PyVerilog, Python's built in `ast` module to parse and analyze Verilog AST (Abstract Syntax Tree), regex for text transformations, argparse library as command-line interface etc.: 
```python
import ast
from pyverilog import parser #PyVerilog can be used here. You need PyVerilog's Python bindings installed to use it in this script: https://github.com/BVA-MDesign/pyvcdb_asttools#installation 
import re  
import argparse   
from xform import XForm #xform is not defined here, you need define your own transforming class and inherit from the basic visitor pattern in this script: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_(pattern) -> example of Visitors Pattern for AST transformations 
  
# Create a parser to parse Verilog code into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). This is required because PyVerilog's API uses the abstract syntax tree, and we need this information later.
verilog_parser = ast.parse('')    # create empty verilog AST  here you can use your own logic for parsing  
                                                            # e.g., using pyvcdb or similar tools to parse Verilog code into an abstract syntax tree (AST).     
# Define a visitor class that implements the transformation pattern from existing xforms   
class ArrayInsideVisitor(XForm):    
  def __init__(self, array_indexes=None):   # define your own constructor with optional parameters like multi-dimensional indexes if any. This is also where you will set up default/initial values for the required variables in this class (like `arrayIndex`).   
      self._result = None  # declare a result variable here which can be used by other methods after calling these method   at end of your function, not before declaring it.    
      
# Define main transformation process from command-line input and return the transformed AST as output:       
def transform(verilog_code):    # define a new visitor that inherits XForm to get all methods defined here      def visit_(self, node) -> Node or List of Nodes :     pass  you need write your own logic for visiting and processing each nodes based on their type.
   return verilog_parser          # Return the transformed AST as output at end    parser = ArrayInsideVisitor()        transform(verilog_code)      if __name__ == "__main__":     parse=argparse.ArgumentParser('Transform Verilog code')  // add description of your arguments here, you might want to use argcomplete or similar tools for argument parsing    args = parser .parse_args()   # call function and print result
```               This is a basic implementation but does not cover all the requirements as mentioned in details. You may need additional work based on specifics such indexes/multi-dimensional arrays, constant indexing etc., also you might want to handle cases like array slices or part select inside operator for multi dimensional support (this will require changes at visitor level).
