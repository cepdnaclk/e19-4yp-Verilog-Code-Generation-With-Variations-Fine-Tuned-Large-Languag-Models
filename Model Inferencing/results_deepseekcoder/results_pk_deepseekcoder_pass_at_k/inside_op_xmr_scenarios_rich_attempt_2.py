You are asking to create a Python module for transforming Verilog/SystemVerilog syntax, which is quite complex and extensive in nature compared to some other languages like C++ or Java. The transformation will involve parsing an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree), creating visitors that identify specific elements of the codebase based on certain criteria defined by a user-provided signal name, applying transformations using regular expressions within this module as well handling cross references and error checking for invalid inputs in both structural ways(like undeclared variables) or runtime errors.

The following is an example implementation: 
```python
import pyverilog as pv
from ast import NodeVisitor, Call, Name
import re
# Define the visitor class that extends from a pattern of existing xforms and includes error handling for invalid inputs in both structural ways (undeclared variables) or runtime errors.
class XForm(NodeVisitor):  # This is where you define your transformation logic here with regex substitutions on AST nodes using NodeVisitor's visit() method, which recursively traverses the Abstract Syntax Tree structure of a Python source code file and applies transformations based upon node types or identifiers.
    def __init__(self):  # Initialize error lists for invalid inputs (undeclared variables) in both structural ways during parsing phase as well runtime errors at different nodes/sections within AST, if any exist after visiting the entire tree structure of source code file with all transformations applied using visit() method.
        self._errors = []  # Define an attribute to hold error messages which can be used for validation and logging purposes later on during execution phase or post-processing step based upon specific requirements/conditions defined by users in task requirement section above, if any errors are found at parsing stage then this list will contain all such information.
    def visit_Call(self, node):  # Define a function to handle Call nodes which represent method calls within AST tree structure and apply transformations on them using regex substitutions with NodeVisitor's base implementation of the same name in Python standard library for handling specific kind/type methods or expressions.
        if isinstance(node, Call) and \  # Check node type to be a call (method invocation), then:   If yes proceed further else exit from function as this will not affect our transformation based on input provided below the point of 'visit_Call' method here in next line after defining NodeVisitor class.
            isinstance(node.func, Name) and \  # Check if it’s a Call node that has an expression (method invocation), then:   If yes proceed further else exit from function as this will not affect our transformation based on input provided below the point of 'visit_Call' method here in next line after defining NodeVisitor class.
            isinstance(node.args[0], str) and \  # Check if it’s a Call node that has an expression (method invocation), then:   If yes proceed further else exit from function as this will not affect our transformation based on input provided below the point of 'visit
