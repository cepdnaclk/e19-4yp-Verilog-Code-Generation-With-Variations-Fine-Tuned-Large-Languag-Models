Firstly, we need to install pyverilog and re modules if they are not already installed in your python environment using pip or conda as follows (only for Python 3):
```shell
pip install -U PyVerilog[ast] # For parsing Verilog files with ast module. You can use other versions of verilog like pyverilog-x if you want to support x syntax only, not the full version from top level directory for simplicity and better performance (default is all features).
pip install re 
```  
Now let's implement our transformation framework:   
(Note that this code assumes Python environment supports parsing Verilog files with ast module)    
Below I have provided a basic structure of the python file which fulfills your requirements. However, it is important to note in all cases you will need proper error handling and validation (e.g., check if old_name exists before renaming). Also consider using argparse library for command line interface: 
```python
import re
from pyverilog import ast as pvast
from functools import singledispatch, update_wrapper
# Create a visitor class that inherits the pattern from existing xforms. You'll need to define what changes will be made for different types of nodes (e.g., Decl and Assign) 
class ExampleVisitor(pvast.NodeVisitor):   # Use pyverilog ast module if you are using verilog language specific features, otherwise use regular Python classes/methods as per requirement    def visit_Decl(self, node: pvast.Decl)->None :     self._modifyChildren()
def visit_Assign(self ,node):   ->  None  # Define the methods you need to handle for different types of nodes if not defined here then it will default handling ie e Visit each child      def _visitChild_(childNode, node)    return super().genericVisitMethodCalls
# Functionality: A function that takes a file name and new signal names.  This should perform the actual transformation on an existing Verilog module    
def transform_module(fileName , oldSignalnameNew):   # Create your functions here, e g., def foo (inputFile : str) -> bool    return True if successful else False       The main function that takes inputs from command line and calls the transformation        
if __ name__ == '__main__' …..:      You can use argparse library to handle cli arguments. Create a parser with specific options (e .g., file, oldNameNew) then parse them using `args = parsersetup(“argument”).parsed_args()`     # The main functionality is implemented in the function below    def foo -> bool:   …..        return True if successful else False
```          You can further improve your code to handle different cases and exceptions as per requirement. Use logging for detailed output at runtime, use try-catch blocks or similar exception handling methods where necessary (e g., retry logic in case of file errors).     `# Create a parser with specific options e .g ‘file’ , 'oldNameNew' `parsersetup(“argument”) and parse them using  `args = parsers.parse_arg()    # The main functionality is implemented here
```   Please note that the above code snippets are highly abstracted, you need to fill in details such as define your own classes/methods for different types of nodes if not done already (e g., Assign , Decl) and also modify `visit_Decl`  method according with node's properties.
