Here's an example of how you could implement this task using PyVerilog and Python in a module named `xarray_converter`, which can be used as follows (assuming that pyverilog is installed): 
```python
# Import necessary modules/packages   
import argparse   # For command line interface arguments    
from ast import parse       # Used to create Abstract Syntax Tree        
from collections.abc      import Iterable       
try:                    from PyVerilogParser          import Parser          
except ModuleNotFoundError as e:             print(e)            def xarray_converter(): 
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()   # Instantiate command line arguments    
parser .add_argument('--input',required=True,help =  'Input verilog file')       
args   = vars(parser .parse_args())          args['file']  = open (Args ,'r').readlines ()  def xform():    # Define the main transformation function         return False   try:     Parser.parseFile ("input")       except Exception as e : print("Error in file parsing",e)       
return True      if __name__ == '__main__':          sys .exit (not xarray_converter())    # Execute the transformation function and exit with a non-zero status code  when called directly, i.e., not as module to be imported in another script or used from command line
```   This is just an example of how you could implement this task using PyVerilog parser within Python context for parsing Verilog files into Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). The error handling and validation part has been left out, but should ideally include proper exception/error messages in case the file can't be opened or parsed.
