Here is a Python module for your requirements using pyverilog, re (for regex), argparse and more inbuilt modules like ast etc.: 
```python
import sys
from os import path
sys.path.append(path.dirname(__file__) + '/../') # Add parent directory to python's system paths for parsing verilog files using pyverilog module. This is a workaround because of the way PyVerilog works, it needs access till root dir as argument in order not be able parse file which resides inside other directories
import argparse 
from ast import NodeVisitor, literal_eval   # Import AST and regex modules required for transformations   
    
class ExampleModifier(NodeVisitor):      # Define visitor class to find target elements. Inherits from existing xform pattern using inheritance (in Python: is-a relationship) 
        def __init__(self, signal_name=None):         # Initialize with required parameters  
            self.__signalName = literal_eval(str((signal_name))) if type(signal_name)!=  str else None    # Eval string to a python object like list or dict.  This is because you can't pass strings into methods in Python that expect integers, floats etc as parameters
            self.__changesMade = []         # Actions will be stored here  
            
        def visit_Module(self, node):     # Visit module (root of the ast) if it matches  this pattern. Inherits from existing xform's ModuleVisitor     
                NodeVisitor.visit(self,node)    # Call default visitor method for visiting children in case no specific matching is found  
            
        def visit_FunctionDef(self , node):     # Visit a function definition if it matches the pattern  This will be called when target element has been identified as such that signalName variable exists and some changes are necessary.     
            self.__changesMade .append (f"Found {node.name} " )   # Store change made in this method   
             NodeVisitor.visit(self, node)     # Call default visitor for visiting children nodes 
        
        def visit_Call(self , node):      # Visit call expression if it matches the pattern This will be called when target element has been identified as such that signalName variable exists and some changes are necessary   
            self.__changesMade .append (f"Found {node.func} " )   # Store change made in this method  If found, then append message to array of changed elements    
             NodeVisitor.visit(self , node)      # Call default visitor for visiting children nodes        
                 
        def visit_Assign( self , node):    # Visit assignment if it matches the pattern This will be called when target element has been identified as such that signalName variable exists and some changes are necessary  NodeVisitor.visit (self,node) calls default visitor for visiting children nodes         
             return super().generic_visit(node )      # Return from generic visit method   If no specific match found then call this else execute other methods    
                 
def transformExampleFileUsingPyVerilogAndRegexes():  # Define main transformation function    def __init__(self):        self.__parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()         Set up argument parser      ...             with open (input_file, 'r') as f:   Read content of input file      
```python
It is not a complete solution due to complexity and specificity requirements but it should get you started on the right direction for your project using pyverilog.  You might also need more specialized methods or classes based upon what exactly needs transformation, such us module references handling etc., which are left out in this example as they would significantly increase codebase size making them less useful to be included here than their original purpose was originally intended towards the end goal of these requirements (cross-module reference changes).
