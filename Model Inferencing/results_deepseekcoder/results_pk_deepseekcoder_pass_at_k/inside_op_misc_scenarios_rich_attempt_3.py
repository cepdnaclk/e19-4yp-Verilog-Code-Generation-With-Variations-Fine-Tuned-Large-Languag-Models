Here's a Python module for your requirements using PyVerilog and regex, along with argparse to handle CLI arguments. For simplicity sake, I will provide examples of handling different edge cases in our visitor class as well as defining test scenarios related to the unary operator inside (`x `). The actual implementation may vary based on exact Verilog/SystemVerilog code you have and your requirements more specifically:

```python
import pyverilog.astnodes as ast
from re import sub, IGNORECASE  # regex support for case-insensitive matching in 're' module (Ignores casing)
import argparse                # Command line argument parsing library to handle arguments from command lines(cli).
    
# Define the visitor class. The pattern matches any node with a name attribute, which is equivalent 
class ExampleVisitor:  
    def __init__(self):            # Initialize changes_made and signal found as false at object creation time in our case for each instance of this Visiter Class we have created till now no change has been made.    
        self.changes_made = []     
        self.signal_found   = False 
        
    def visit(self, node):          # Visit method which is called on every Node and checks if it matches our targeted signal name or not using the `hasattr` function in python to check for an attribute named 'name' (the case insensitive match)           
        from pprint import pformat  # Pretty print module used here. It formats objects into a more readable way by adding indents and line breaks etc, which makes our output easier to debug         
        
        if isinstance(node, ast.Node):    # Check for target declarations (equivalent of Python's `isinstance`)           
             self._check_signal_name(node)  # Call the private method _CheckSignalName which will check our targeted signal name in a recursive manner         
             
        if isinstance(node, ast.Decl):    # For nodes with declarations (equivalent of Python's `is`). In this case we only care about 'Node', so no further checking needed here            
            for item in node.list:           # Loop over all items within the declaration         
                self._check_signal_name(item)  # Check if they are nodes with our targeted signal name (equivalent of Python's `hasattr` function). This is done recursively, so this will work for nested declarations too.           
        
        nodechildren = list(node.children())    # Get all children         
                                               # Visit each child in the same manner as before          
        return self._visit_allnodes(nodechildren)  # Return True if any nodes were visited (equivalent of Python's `any` function on a generator, which returns true immediately for first found node), otherwise False.         
    
    def _check_signal_name(self, item):   # A private method to check the targeted signal name in an individual way           
        if hasattr(item,'name') and (str)(item).__contains__(('x')):  # Check for 'signals' named x. Equivalent of Python’s `has` operator with pattern matching         
             self._changes_made()   # Call the private method _ChangesMade to add a message about signal found, equivalent in python as an attr append operation on list          
        
    def visit(self):  # Visitor for testing purposes. This is not necessary if we are only interested whether our targeted node has been visited or not         
        pass    
```  
Testing the visitor: We can use a `test_visit` method in your main function to test all edge cases and scenarios, like this - 
- For 'x' values tests (like x0 for positive numbers) as well as comparison with other signals. You will have different ways of generating these kinds if input data changes based on the target signal or its value(s).  
```python
def test_visit():    # Testing function          
     visitor = ExampleVisitor()  //Create a new instance            
         
         for i in range(-5,6):      ///< Generate 'x' values from -4 to +3 as per requirement. We can replace them with any other signal name or value if required           
              visit(i)           /* Call the visitor on current node (equivalent of Python’s `visit` method). This will call all child nodes recursively */       
     print('Signal found:',  // Print whether our targeted signals were visited.             )          else 'Not Found')    """Print a message depending upon signalfound"""           }   /* Call the visitor on root node (equivalent of Python’s `visit` method). This will call all child nodes recursively */    
```     
This is just an example, you may need to modify or expand it according your specific requirements. Also make sure pyverilog and re are installed in python environment by using pip install PyVerilog regex etc if not already done so.  You can run the script from command line as follows: `python xform_module -i inputfile -o outputfile` where 'input file' is your Verilog source code, you want to transform and then save it into a new location (the same filename with different extension .sv or equivalent).
