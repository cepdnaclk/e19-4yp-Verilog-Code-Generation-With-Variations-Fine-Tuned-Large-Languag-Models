Sure, I can help you design a Python module for your requirements using PyVerilog to parse and analyze Verilog/SystemVerilog ASTs (Abstract Syntax Trees). The main changes are made in `visit` method of visitor class which is responsible for identifying reset signals. 

```python
import pyverilog as pv
from argparse import ArgumentParser, RawDescriptionHelpFormatter

class ResetVisitor(pv.expr_node.ExprNode):
    def __init__(self, rst: str = 'rst'): # default is reset signal name in your case "reset" 
        self._srcpytype =  pv.__visit__dict['assign']([], [])  
        
       super(ResetVisitor, self).__init__()    	         		                                                                                                          									   			                         								                        	 							                    	   	     	        # assign is the operator for assignment in pyverilog.expr_node 						      pv.__visit__(assign,[],[])  
        return None                      
       def visit(self, node):    	         		                                                                                                          									   			                         								                        	 							                    	   	     	        # call parent's method first for each child of the current Node.
