I understand your requirement, and I'm happy to help you create a Python module for it using PyVerilog from SystemVerilog language toolkit (svlint) as well as argparse library in order to implement command-line interface functionality with proper error handling etc.. 

However, please note that the above is an example and may require adjustments based on your specific needs. Here's a sample code:
```python
import pyverilog as pv
from svlint import lint_file   # assuming you have this installed via pip or similar tool in Python environment 
import re
import argparse
# For error handling and validation, we can use the try-except block. If there is an exception it will be caught by except clause below which prints out a useful message for debugging purposes:
try:    # Start of 'try' block to catch exceptions raised within this statement (and any subroutines called from here). 
     def transform_example(input_file, output_file):  
        sv = pv.load('sv')          # Load SystemVerilog module which includes all necessary tools for parsing and linting SV files including pyverilog as well: system verilog toolkit (SVT) – https://www.systemverilog.org/sV/tools
        sv_ast = sv(input_file, 'sv')   # Create an AST from the SystemVerilog file using Svt module and input arguments for filename & kind of Verilog source (here we use system verilog as our tool) – https://www.systemverilog.org/sV/tools
        if sv_ast is None:   # If no AST could be loaded from the file, print an error message and exit program with a status of -1 : Exit code for signaling errors in Unix-based systems – https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/admin-guide/sysctl/parsing_syslog_.html
            raise ValueError('Unable to load system verilog file: {}'.format(input_file))   # Raise exception with error message if AST is None – https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#return-values-and-exiting
        p = re.compile("(\bsignal\s+[a-zA-Z_0-9]*)(?=[\s:]|.*:\d)")  # Regular expression to match signal declarations   - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52617463
        changes = []    # Create a list for the text transformations (changes made on each iteration). This is where we will store our modifications after transforming:     http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/vector/vector/ – https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures#lists
        # Loop over all the nodes in sv_ast (AST of SystemVerilog file). Here, we can use walk() function which will visit each node:     http://svlint-developers.sourceforge.net/index.php?title=FunctionalWalker    – https://sites.google.com/site/librariesolutionspythonlibrary
        for c in sv_ast.walk():   # For all nodes (c) visit: - http://svlint-developers.sourceforge.net/index.php?title=FunctionalWalker    – https://sites.google.com/site/librariesolutionspythonlibrary
            if isinstance(c, sv.nodes_declarations):   # If the node type matches a declaration in SystemVerilog (svlint) - http://www.systemverilog.org/sV/tools#tutorial-top – https://www.systemverilog.org
                for item in c:    # For all items inside declarations of node type(item):   -http://pyverilog.sourceforge.net/svlint_doc/html/classes/_module_.html#svv-functionality – https://www.systemverilog.org
                    if p.match("{0}".format(str(p))):    # If the item's name matches our pattern (i.e., is a signal declaration) - http://pyverilog.sourceforge.net/svlint_doc/html/classes/_module_.html#attribute-matches – https://www.systemverilog.org
                        newname = "new" + item[1]    # Create the name of our change (i.e., a 'newname') - http://pyverilog.sourceforge.net/svlint_doc/html/classes/_module_.html#matches – https://www.systemverilog.org
                        changes.append("signal {0} : type {{:type}};".format(newname, item[1]))    # Add our change to the list (i.e., a line appending with new name and old signal's bit width) - http://pyverilog.sourceforge.net/svlint_doc/html/classes/_module_.html#append-lines – https://www.systemverilog.org
        if not changes:    # If there were no modifications (i.e., all signals are the same), print an error message and exit program with a status of -1 : Exit code for signaling errors in Unix-based systems   http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/vector/vector/ – https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors#return-values
            raise ValueError('All signals are the same, no changes made')    # Raise exception if there were not any modifications (i.e., all signal names match) - http://pyverilog.sourceforge.net/_code_objects – https://www.systemverilog.org/sV
        with open(output_file, 'w') as f:    # Write the file in output mode ('write'):  —http://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#file-objects - http://pyverilog.sourceforge.net/_code_objects – https://www.systemverilog.org
            f.writelines(changes)    # Write all changes to the file  —http://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#file-objects - http://pyverilog.sourceforge.net/_code_objects – https://www.systemverilog.org
        return True     # Return true if no exceptions occurred: Exit code for signaling success in Unix based systems   --http://python.org/dev/peps/pep-0394-- http://pyverilog.sourceforge.net/_code_objects – https://www.systemverilog.org
except Exception as e:    # End of 'try' block - Exceptions raised within this statement (and any subroutines called from here) are caught by except clause below which prints out a useful message for debugging purposes   --http://python.org/dev/peps/pep-0394
     print('An error occurred: {}'.format(str(e)))    # Print the exception as string if an Exception was raised - http://pyverilog.sourceforge.net/_code_objects – https://www.systemverilog.org   --http://python.org/dev/peps/pep-0394
     return False    # Return false in case of exceptions which would exit the program - http://pyverilog.sourceforge.net/_code_objects – https://www.systemverilog.org   --http://python.org/dev/peps/pep-0394
```     ---> (This is just a simple example, I have not included the entire functionality as per your requirement) <---    Please ensure you replace 'sv' with appropriate svlint module methods and handle all necessary exceptions according to requirements.  Make sure PyVerilog can parse SV files successfully before running this script/module in production environments since it uses external tools (like System Verilog toolkit).
