Below is a Python module template for your requirement using pyverilog and re (regular expressions) libraries to perform transformations on Verilog files, based upon an abstract visitor pattern in XForm library which you may want more information about or implement further if needed specifically related with this task but I will provide the main parts of it.
Please note that implementing a full-fledged tool would require much deeper work and is beyond my current capabilities to write out complete code for such an extensive request, however below provides a starting point on how you can start: 
```python
import argparse   # Argument parser module from Python Standard Library.
from pyverilog import parse_file as pvf    # Module that helps in parsing Verilog files using PyVerilog library by John McDonough (http://jmcadan.com/pyverilog).  This will be helpful for identifying wire declarations and replacing 'wire' with a reg variable keyword etc..
import re   # Regular expression module from Python Standard Library which is used to perform regular expressions operations on strings or sets of strings based upon the pattern provided in regex patterns.   
from xform import XForm, TransformationFailed  # Assuming you have an 'xtransform' library that contains a visitor class for this task - it might be named differently so adjust accordingly if necessary..  
    
def main():       # Main function where all our magic happens! (Python Standard Library).   
      parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="A tool to transform Verilog files.")  # Create an argument parsers for command line arguments - it'll help the user understand what options are available and how they can use them..  
       ...         # Add your program option here if needed, e.g., parser.add_argument('filename', type=str) .....     .  (continue as per requirements).   
      args = parser.parse_args()        # Parsing command line arguments and storing in 'args' variable..  
       ...         # Handle your file argument here, e.g., pvf(filepath), parse the output of above operation into AST etc...  (continue as per requirements).   
      result = xform_ast()             # Calling our main transformation function with 'args' variable..  
       ...         # Handle your return value here, e.g., if not isinstance(result,'bool'), raise ValueError('Unexpected type {}'.format()) ..... (continue as per requirements).    .  If all transformations succeeded then True will be returned else False or Raise an appropriate exception..  
       ...         # Print out your result here, e.g., print("Transformed successfully: ",result) if 'True' is equal to our variable otherwise raise ValueError('Failed transformation') ..... (continue as per requirements).  .   
      return None     # Return statement in Python Standard Library which indicates that the function has executed a fully and correctly, terminating execution..  
        ...          # This will be called automatically after main() is done. If you need to pass data back then use this line ..... (continue as per requirements).  .   
def xform_ast():     # Transformation AST wrapper function inside our 'main' module - it should return a Boolean result indicating the success or failure of transforming..   ...     +-----[snip]-------+  ....

     xf._target = re  .findall(r'wire\s*(\w+|\'\w+\')\s*\;\s*(.*?)',pvf('{}').__str__)   # Find wire declarations in the Verilog file, replace 'reg' with a reg variable.. (continue as per requirements).
     xf._replacements = [(r'\bwire\b','reg'), ...    ]  .replace) for e... etc.].append((tree.__str__(),args)) # Replace wire declarations in the transformed AST with a reg variable.. (continue as per requirements).
