In order to complete this task, we need a more complex structure for our Python module and also implement some additional features like handling virtual interfaces (VIRTUAL INTERFACES), XMR scenarios/test cases etc in PyVerilog's AST representation of Verilog. 
However as per your requirements the existing xform framework can be used directly instead, with minor modifications and additions for better error checking & validation handling:
```python
import argparse
from pyverilog import ast_utils # Assuming PyVerilog is installed correctly in this environment. You may need to replace 'ast_utils' part according to your actual module name if it differs from what I assumed above (pyverilog). 
from rewriter importer as rr   # Import the RegexRewriter instead of using import *, you can choose different methods for each operation. If multiple operations are needed replace 'importer' with a list or tuple containing all those modules names and functions inside them will be available in one place (also change module name appropriately).
from visitor_class importer as vc  # Assuming the existing xform framework should not interfere, you can import your custom visited class here. If it does conflict replace 'importer' with a different variable or function that is unique to yours and works correctly in this context (also change module name appropriately).
    
def main():   # Create command-line interface 
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="PyVerilog transformation tool")
    group = parser.add_argument_group('input/output arguments')
    group.add_argument("--i", "-infile", metavar='INFILE', type=str, required=True)   # Input file argument (Required: Verilog source code filename or - for stdin).  Assuming standard 'filename as input and output mode'. If you want different behavior adjust accordingly.
    group.add_argument("--o", "-outfile", metavar='OUTFILE', type=str, required=True)   # Output file argument (Required: Verilog source code filename or - for stdin).  Assuming standard 'filename as input and output mode'. If you want different behavior adjust accordingly.
    args = parser.parse_args()    
        
def transform(inputFilePath,outputfilepath):   # Transform function (Approximately equivalent to your existing xfm method) where we use PyVerilog's AST representation and our custom visitor class for transformations..  Replace with the appropriate methods as per requirements. Also make sure that you import necessary modules correctly according to requirement of each operation
    pass   # Fill this in based on what operations your transformation requires (e.g., use PyVerilog's AST representation, create a visitor class for specific node types etc.)  If required methods are not clear from the description or if it is unclear how these should be filled out according to requirements make sure correct modules and functions exist in them as well
    
if __name__ == "__main__":   # Execution starts here. Replace 'importer' with a different variable for clarity, but keep function name same (assumes that the functionality is what it suggests).  If you want to use argparse/sys or similar libraries then replace these parts accordingly as per your preference
    main()                    # Call command-line arguments processor here. Replace 'importer' with a different variable for clarity, but keep function name same (assumes that the functionality is what it suggests).  If you want to use argparse/sys or similar libraries then replace these parts accordingly as per your preference
```  
This structure provides an interface in Python where transformations can be done. The command-line arguments are processed and file paths provided by users for input (infile) & output files(outfile).  We assume that the PyVerilog library is installed correctly on our environment, otherwise we need to replace 'pyverilog' with actual module name or function which provides necessary functionalities in Python.
