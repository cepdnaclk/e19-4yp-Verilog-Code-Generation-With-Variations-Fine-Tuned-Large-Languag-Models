Here is a Python module for your requirement using PyVerilog and re (regular expression) to perform bit width change of signals in Verilog/SystemVerilog files, following these steps: 1-Find signal declaration;2-Replace its old size with new one ;3-Handle input or output declarations.
```python
# Import necessary libraries
import pyverilog as pv
from re import sub   # Python's built in regular expression module for substitutions on strings   
    
class BitWidthVisitor(pv.XForm):  # Inheriting from xform to apply visitor logic     
        
        def __init__(self, signal_name , newwidth) -> None:      
            self.__signal = pv.Signal([], name=signal_name + '_changed')  
            super().__init__()     # Initialize parent class   
            
        @property                  
        def output(self):         
           return [getattr (pv .Expr, 'output', self.__sig)]  # Returns the signal after transformation     
        
       # Implementing function to replace bit width in declarations with new one    
        async def visit_Declaration__(node: pv.Node) -> None :   
             if isinstance( node ,pv .Decl):  
                 for item in  (list)(getattr(item, 'name')) and getattr((item,'width'),'old')==self.__signal['new'] ) or \     # Checking whether it has the desired signal name & width   
                    isinstance(__parent , pv.Module):   // Also checking if node belongs to module  then return False else True, not sure about your original xform framework so I used simple logic here     
                     self.__signal['old']=getattr(node,'width')('new');        # Changing the width of signal   
             for child in (list)(__parent.children()) :     // Visit children   if any  then return False else True, not sure about your original xform framework so I used simple logic here         
                 self.__signal['old']=getattr(node,'width')('new');       # Changing the width of signal
