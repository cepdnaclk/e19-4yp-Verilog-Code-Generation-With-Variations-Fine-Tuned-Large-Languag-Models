Here is an example of how you can implement this task using PyVerilog and Python's argparse library to create a CLI (Command Line Interface).  Note that we will assume here for simplicity, but in practice Verilog/SystemVerilog codebase would be much more complex. For instance: the xform framework might have additional nodes or rules which are not handled by this simple example yet and it may need to handle errors gracefully etc.,
```python
import pyverilog as pv
from re import sub, IGNORECASE  # Python's standard library for regular expressions.
# Import argparse module from python Standard Library which will help in creating command line interface  
import argparse   
    
class ArrayDeclVisitor(pv.ast_visitors.AstVisitor):     
    def __init__(self, signalName=None) -> None:         # Initialize visitor with target name (Signal Name).          self.signalFound = False and  arrayChangesMade as []     pdef visitDeclaration(node : DeclarationNodeType )->> list[str]:
        """Visit a declarations node"""      if isinstance(decl, Node):         # Check for the target declaration i.e., ArrayDecl       return None    self._changes = [f"Found {self.__signalName}"]          elif hasattr("item", "name") and item.name == signal_name:           
        """If found a declarations node with same name"""         print(node)           # Visit children nodes  (recursively).      for c in self._visitChildrenNodesRecursively(c):             yield from visitNodeChild()                  def _buildCommandLineArgumentsParser():          parser = argparse.ArgumentParser("Example Verilog Transform Tool")        
        """Create a command line interface"""           # Arguments required by the CLI, e..g., input file and output path           
parser.add_argument('-i', '--inputFilePath ', default=None)          parser.add_argument( '-o' ,  --outputfilepath   )         return args                                                                                     def main():             # Main function to initiate the transformation tool...       if __name__ == "main":                 print("Transforming...")(args = _buildCommandLineArgumentsParser())                 
# Call Transform Function and catch exceptions (if any)          try:                    xfmResult  := transform(inputFilePath, outputfilepath,...      except Exception as eï¼š             # Catch all exception.         raise       print("Failed to perform transformation... ", str(e)) return main()
```    If you have already a verilog file in 'f' and want the changes done on it then use `pyverilog` module, else create new one using pyVerilog API like below:  You can also find more about PyVerifyodule from Python Standard Library. Also note that this is just an example code snippet for a command line tool which might need to be further elaborated according the specific requirement and requirements of your project
