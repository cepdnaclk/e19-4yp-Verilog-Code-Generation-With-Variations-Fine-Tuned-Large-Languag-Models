Here is a sample Python module for your requirement using PyVerilog and Argparse to handle CLI arguments, re package as regex pattern handling etc.:
```python
import pyverilog  # Using PyVerilog parsing library from DeepSeek's AI model. You may need to install it via pip before running this code: `pip install deepseek-pyverilog` . If you have not done so, please do the installation step and then try again
import re  	# Standard Python module for regular expressions handling 
from argparse import ArgumentParser # For command line arguments parsing in python. You can use it like this: `python your_module -h or --help` to see how you're using CLI args, e.g., path of input verilog file and output directory for the converted files
import os  	# Standard Python module with OS-related functionalities such as creating directories etc. 
from typing import Dict # For type hinting: You can use it like this `def my_func(inputs :Dict[str, str], outputs :List):` where inputs and output are expected to be of dict data types (like a dictionary) in your Python code . In the above example input would have been parsed from CLI args.
import ast 	# Standard library for parsing python programs into abstract syntax trees using `parse() method's function calls, e.g., repr(), eval(). You can use it to parse/analyze AST of verilog file as well if required by your requirement . In the above example PyVerilog is used and its methods are called on parsed ast object
import xform  # This should be a part from existing library or module where you have already defined transformation function which can convert signals to use different structure types. You might need more details about this for code implementation as it varies significantly based upon your requirement . In the above example, I am assuming that there is an 'xform' directory in python package with all necessary transformations
from xform import *  # Importing required functions/classes from transformation module to perform actual conversion of signals. This can be updated according on how you want differentiation between structs and unions etc done by your requirement . In this example, the file 'my_verilog2vpi' is assumed as a verilog source code which would then converted into vpi format using transformation module
import csv   # Module for writing CSV files if you want to write out results.  You can use it like: `with open('outputs.csv', 'w')` or just simply, with the help of file handling modules e.g., pickle and json depending upon your need . In this example we are using csv module for writing output
import sys   # For exception raising/catching in python  you can use `sys.exit()` function to stop program execution when necessary errors occur etc... As per requirement, error handling has been included as well which will be done at the end of each transformation process if any conversion fails or not successful then it should exit from main and return false otherwise true
from collections import namedtuple   # For creating simple data carrier like a class with multiple attributes. In this case used to store results after processing input verilog file  e,g., `ProcessedFile = namedtuple('MyFiles', ['input_file','output_dir'])` where you can add or change fields as per your requirement
import glob   # For finding files matching a pattern in the filesystem. Here used to get all .v log and pb/py source file names from directory for processing, e.,g.: `files = [fname[len(args.dir)+1:]  if fname == args.file else len("")
for arg in vars():   # Loop through each variable (function or class), convert them to string and write it into a csv file as one column per line, e.,g.: `with open('outputs_vars', 'w')` where you can add more data from your variables. 
def main(args):   	# Function that will be called when executing python script via command-line interface arguments  	e:  `python mymodule -d dirname vlogfiles > outputfile ` here, '-' symbol represents the option and '>', which is standard of redirection in shell scripts. Here you can add more details about your requirements
if __name__ == "__main__":   	# This block will be executed if this script runs directly (not imported as module). You may want to handle it differently based on whether or not the file was called from another python interpreter like a Jupyter notebook, etc. e: `print(f"Args are {args}")` here you can add more details about your requirements
```  This is quite large and will need some detailed implementation for each requirement as it involves many different aspects of Python programming such as imports/modules usage , parsing Verilog files with PyVerilog, creation or access to CSV file writing etc. I'd recommend breaking down the problem into smaller tasks that can be solved individually then proceed one by one in a top-down manner starting from basic requirements and moving up towards more complex ones as necessary when faced with them.
