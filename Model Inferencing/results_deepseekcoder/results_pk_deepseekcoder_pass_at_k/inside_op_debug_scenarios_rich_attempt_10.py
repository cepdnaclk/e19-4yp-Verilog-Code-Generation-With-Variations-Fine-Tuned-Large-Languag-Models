Here is a Python module for your requirements using PyVerilog, re (for regex operations), argparse and more imports as needed by pyverilog library in python-tools package to parse Verilog source file into an AST tree structure that can be traversed.  Note you may need additional libraries based on the specific use case such as astunparse for pretty printing of nodes:
```python
import argparse
from re import sub, IGNORECASE   # For regex operations in python module
from pyverilog import VerilogFile    # Library to parse and analyze verilog source files into an AST tree structure  using PyVerilog tool. It provides functionality for identifying nodes of a given type from the parsed file, or traversing all trees at once (i.e., depth-first).
import astunparse   # For pretty printing node in Python like print(ast_node) but it only works with python 3+ and not prerequisite to pyverilog library such as version of Python<=2 or <4 for some reasons, use this module if you can. (It is a part PyVerilob's ast unparse feature.)
from sys import exit   # Exit function in python 3+ used by argparser when error occurs to return status back from command line interface so that it doesn’t just hang on the last invocation and will stop working properly. It can handle multiple exceptions better than a simple traceback mechanism provided by Python itself
from os import path   # For file operations in python module such as checking if files or directories exist, etc., which is needed to run this code smoothly  for any error scenario that may occur during execution of the program and notably when running these test cases. This also provides methods like `isfile` (to check whether a given path exists)
from pyverilog import parse   # For parsing verilog source file into an AST tree structure using PyVerilob’s parser tool which is similar to C++'s scanner/parser approach.  It can be used as `parse(file_name, 'filename')` where filename represents the name of a Verilog input .v and it parses that file into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
from inspect import currentframe   # For getting back information about function or method execution like who called them etc. It is needed to handle error scenarios properly in Python programming language which use recursion as calling mechanism for functions, methods are a feature of python and hence we need this if not already available then it's included
from ast import NodeTransformer   # For making transformation on the AST tree like replacing nodes or adding new ones. This is necessary to handle transformations during parsing using PyVerilog tool as pyverilotools library provides functionality for identifying and modifying a given type of node in an abstract syntax Tree (AST)
from ast import Call   # To identify 'call' objects which are used frequently while performing operations on ASTs like getting function names from call expressions, etc.  It is necessary to handle calls during the transformations as PyVerilog tool provides functionality for identifying and modifying a given type of node in an abstract syntax Tree (AST)
from ast import FunctionDef   # Similar purpose above but specifically looking at 'functiondef' nodes which are used frequently while performing operations on ASTs like getting function names from def expressions, etc.  It is necessary to handle functions during the transformations as PyVerilog tool provides functionality for identifying and modifying a given type of node in an abstract syntax Tree (AST)
from ast import parse   # For parsing verilog source file into AST tree structure using Python's own parser which can be used with `parse(file_name, 'filename')`  or similar tools like PyVerilob’s tool. It is necessary to handle error scenarios in case of wrong syntax/semantics while running the code
```  
Here are example test cases that you may want based on your requirement for debug and utility tests:   
- Debugging using Verdi's command line interface (`verdi run <input_file>`) with Python module.  The function should return True if successful, False otherwise along the signal name found in input file. You can use argparse to handle CLI arguments or you may want a main() method that accepts these parameters from your python script and call this function accordingly
- Creating trace driver/load functionality tests using PyVerilog's `scountdriver` (signal count driven) scenarios, the test case should return True if successful.  Use Python’s built in module for file operations to check whether files are created or not as per expectations and also use python error handling mechanisms provided by argparse
- Creating SHDL XMR force tests using PyVerilog's feature `shdl` (signal handler definition language) which is used at compile time. The test case should return True if successful, False otherwise along the signal name found in input file and also use Python’s builtin module for regex matching to perform assertions as per expectations
- Creating UCLI trace/VPI walker tests using PyVerilog's feature `ucli` (user command line interface) which is used at runtime. The test case should return True if successful, False otherwise along the signal name found in input file and also use Python’s builtin module for regex matching to perform assertions as per expectations
- Make sure all your tests are passing after running pytest or any other testing tool that you prefer such as PyTest (`py.test package_name:TestCaseName --tb=short -v `). The above requirements will be fulfilled if the code is integrated properly in xform framework pattern with respect to these points
