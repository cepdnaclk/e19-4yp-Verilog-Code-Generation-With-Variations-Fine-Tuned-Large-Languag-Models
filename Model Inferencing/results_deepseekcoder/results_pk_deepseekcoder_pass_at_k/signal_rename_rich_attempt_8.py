Here is a python module for your requirement using pyverilog and re modules to perform transformations on Verilog/SystemVerilog files according to specified rules in an expert level Python programmer's perspective, not requiring deep understanding of AST(Abstract Syntax Tree) or Regex. 
Also included are command line interface with argparse for input parameters:  
Please note that this module is a simple illustration and may need additional error handling based on your specific requirements (like checking if the signals exist in given files). The actual implementation would be more complex, involving parsing ASTs correctly using pyverilog's parser.py functions or by other means such as creating an Abstract Syntax Tree from file content yourself to perform all transformations at once and not step-by-step for better performance/efficiency depending on the files involved in your transformation operation:
```python 
import argparse   # Python builtin module, which provides a way of using command line arguments.    You can use it like this inside main function after defining argument parser -> args = parse_args() or if you want to manually input data into program then make object from the class and pass that obj in your functions
import re        # Python builtin module for regular expression operations 
from pyverilog import PyVerilog, VerilogError   # A python wrapper around verilog-linter's C++ API (which is used to parse/analyze the ast). It also provides a way of identifying target elements. You can use it like this inside main function after defining visitor class -> visit_Module(self) or similar for other nodes in your AST
import sys       # Python builtin module that allows you get information about running state (like current exception, return value etc.).   Use 'sys' to exit the program if an error occurs during execution. 
def main():    
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="Rename signal in Verilog files.") # Create a new Argument Parser object and define its description or help message as per requirement (optional).   This is how we will pass input parameters to the program when running it from command line  like: python your_script.py -oldName oldname -newName newname filename
    parser.add_argument('-oldName', type=str, required = True , help  = 'The name of signal being searched for in file') # Define an argument where user can provide input and specify the parameter it requires (required: true means error will be raised if not provided), set default value as None using Optional positional arguments.
    parser.add_argument('-newName', type=str, required = True , help  = 'The new name to replace old signal with')  # Define another argument where user can provide input and specify the parameter it requires (required: true means error will be raised if not provided), set default value as None using Optional positional arguments.
    parser.add_argument('filename', type=str, help  = 'The file to perform transformations on' )   # Define a Positional argument for filename that is required and provide some description/help message  like: -h or --help (optional). This will be automatically provided by argparse if not passed during execution
    args = parser.parse_args()     # Parse the arguments from command line to obj, after define all your parameters as 'required' type='' etc...   The function parse_args( ) is used for parsing and getting user input in python scripts  or programs like here you are passing it into main().
    try:           // Try block contains a series of commands that might raise an exception. If any command within the "try" statement raises, then control passes to next available "except". Here we use 'Exception' as general catch-all for all exceptions and print out details if there is one 
        ast = PyVerilog().parse(args.filename)   // Parse file content using pyverilog parser which can parse a given Verilog/SystemVerilog source code, return an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). Use this AST to perform transformations as per requirements provided in your requirement
        # Perform necessary transformation operations on the Ast here. You might want some kind of visitor pattern implemented if you have complex tree traversal needs which can be done using pyverilog's built-in functions  like visit_Module, etc for each node type or as required by transformations in your requirement
        # After all modifications are complete save the file back to a verilog source code. This is not necessary if you perform transformation on entire module at once and do it manually using appropriate methods provided pyverilog's parser  like revert_file method etc  
    except VerilogError as e:       // 'except Exception', similar handling for other exceptions, print out details or handle them appropriately based upon your requirement. Use specific exception classes in python to catch and respond accordingly using Python’s built-in try/catch blocks – like so -> def main():...try except block
        sys.exit("Error: " + str(e))    // Exit the program with a message including error details when an Verilog related exception occurs, you can use this to handle errors and exceptions in your Python scripts or programs as per requirement – similar handling for all other scenarios like -h/--help etc.
if __name__ == "__main__":    // The following code is a special statement that allows the execution of script based on if it's run directly by python interpreter (not called from another module). If you have any logic or functionality in main function, then Python will execute this block and call your defined functions.
     print(args)   # Print command line input parameters for reference – similar operations can be done inside 'try'-block to validate inputs before performing transformations on file/s as per requirement (optional).    Call the above mentioned methods in order from top-to bottom, if required you might want or need other method calls after this one.
```   Please note that Python scripts and programs should ideally start with import statements at beginning of script to ensure all necessary modules are available for usage while running your program dynamically – similar constructs can be used in larger projects where multiple files/scripts require different sets of functionality or when using multiprocessing.
