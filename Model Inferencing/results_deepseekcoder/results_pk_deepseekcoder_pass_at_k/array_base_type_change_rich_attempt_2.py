You have a requirement for an array declaration type to be changed, and you need help implementing this in Python using pyverilog library as well as re (regex) module which will handle text transformations. 
The following is just how your code should look like with the mentioned requirements implemented - it doesn't contain all details but gives a high level idea of what kind of structure to use:
```python
import argparse, pyverilog, os, re
from typing import List, Union
os.environ['PYVERILOG_HOME'] = '/path/to/.pyverilog' # Set this according your .pyverilog installation path 

class ArrayDeclarationVisitor(object):  
    def __init__(self, signal: str) -> None:        
        self.signal= pyverilog.parse_expression('`{}'.format(signal))[0] # Assuming the name of Signal is given in string format 
     
    
def transform (inputfile :str , outputFile : Union [List, str], baseType: List) -> bool:      
    ast = pyverilog.parse_design_file(filename= inputfile)[0] # Parsing the design file  
          
    visitor  = ArrayDeclarationVisitor (signal =  "arraydeclaration")  # Create a Visitor with target signal name as 'array declaration'    
        
      
      def visitNode(*args):          // Define your own function for visiting nodes in ast. This could be done using pyverilog or any other approach  
        if isinstance (node, Node) :  # Checking the type of node   
            ...                      // Perform required transformations on each target found    
           return True              // Return true to indicate success      
      visitor .visit(ast )         // Apply Visitor function onto ast. This will visit all nodes and perform desired changes  
        content = open (inputfile, 'r').read ()    # Reading the input file 
          ...                      // Perform transformations on contents of textual files    
       with open ('path/to'+outputFile , mode="w") as f:      // Writing to output File. This could be achieved using any method you want  
           ....                   // Write content here    and close file  at the end, in case writing is successful or not         
     return True                  # Return true if success else false      
```       
Please note that this code snippet does a very basic job of implementing your requirement. It doesn't handle cases like changing width specifications for different types etc., and also takes an input file (design) as it expects array declaration in the design files, not inside verilog source codes or other kinds if coded textual files/data structures are present here which could be challenging to achieve with current approach. You might need a more complex visitor pattern that includes these additional features such as handling ports and arrays declarations separately etc., 
and you would also have to write the main function, command line interface code for your program using argparse library in python   or use some other way of providing input/output file paths from cli. Also make sure all imports are correct by verifying if they exist as per Python's requirements and conventions 
(e.g., you should have `pyverilog`,  `os , re , argparse... modules imported).  
Also remember to handle errors correctly in your code - for instance when the file does not exists or cannot be read from etc.. This is a high level idea of how this could look like and might need adjustments according to specific requirements.  Also keep an eye on documentation strings, comments inside functions if they are more than just explaining what function should do but also about inputs/outputs for each method (make sure you understand the data flow in your methods), use docstrings when possible or at least comment them out until a point where it'd be clear why and how.  
Remember to test this code thoroughly before deploying, as well!  This is just an example of what might look like one part of such full system if you are looking for something more elaborate (like handling different types/data structures in the array declarations or error checking). Please also note that pyverilog can have a complex and abstract syntax tree structure which may not be suitable to handle all scenarios directly. 
In this case, I suggest using PyVerilog's low-level API if you need more control over your work (like modifying nodes in the AST at runtime). It is also worth mentioning that pyverilog does have a Python bindings which can be used to generate Verilog from python programs. This might give additional benefit as it allows for easier manipulation of parsed verilogs and provides better support when compared with ast based parsers like PyVerilog or pylint, because these tools provide more capabilities over the raw AST structure in Python code.
