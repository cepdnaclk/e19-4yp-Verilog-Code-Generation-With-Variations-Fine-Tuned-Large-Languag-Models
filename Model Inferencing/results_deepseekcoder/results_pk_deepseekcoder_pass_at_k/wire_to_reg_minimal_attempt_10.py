Here is a Python module for your requirement using pyverilog, re (for regular expressions), argparse and textx which are standard python modules to parse command line arguments in addition to `ast` from PyVerilog's AST library that will be used as an interpreter of the Verilog code:
```python
import ast
from pyverilog import parser, translator  # Importing necessary classes and methods.
import re    # For regular expressions handling in python program.
import argparse   # To handle command line arguments provided by user while running module from terminal/command prompt via Python interpreter or any other language similar to C# / Java etc.. . Also includes error messages if something is wrong with the inputs given on CLI and helps when run as a script rather than being imported into another program.
import xform    # Assuming you've defined your own custom transformation module named 'xform'. You can create it or import an existing one based upon requirement, ie., from other_module (replace `other_module` with the name of any python file containing a definition for that class/function).
``` 
Now letâ€™s define Visitor Class and Main Function to perform transformation:  
(In this example we assume xform is another module where you have defined your custom transformations)   
The visitor will visit all 'Wire' statements in the code, then replace them with Reg variables. It should be noted that Verilog/SystemVerilog AST manipulation can get complex depending on what kind of verilogs are being analyzed (e.g., array types).   For now this example focuses only around identifying and replacing 'wire' declarations to regs:
```python
class WireToRegVisitor(xform.XFormASTVisitor):  # You may need a different class if you have more complex transformation requirements, but the xform package provides basic functionality for such transformations (like this one).   The XFM visitor should inherit from it and override specific methods as needed to perform your custom transforms on AST nodes.
    def visit_Wire(self, node):  # This is a method that will be called when visiting each 'wire' statement in the code. It takes single or list of wire declarations (as returned by pyverilog parser).   For now we just handle one declaration at once due to simplicity.
        new_node = self._generateRegNode(ast.Name(id=self.__getWireIdFromAST(node), ctx=parser.ParseTreeToCTX()))  # Generate a reg node from wire declarations, using pyverilog's method of generating names for the same purpose as verigos AST nodes generate id/name properties on their own (id and name are just string representations).
        self._body[self.__getWireIdFromAST(node)] = new_node  # Add node to body, replacing old wire with reg. This is not a perfect solution because it does not handle the case when multiple wires point at same location so need more robust handling in real world applications (for example adding references).
        return [new_node]  
    def __getWireIdFromAST(self, node):  # A helper method to get wire id from ast.Name object of an individual declaration/declaration part ie., 'wire xxx' or the case for multiple wires declarations like `wires { a b c ; }` .
    def _generateRegNode(self, name_node: parser.ParseTreeToCTX) -> None:  # This method generates SystemVerilog AST node representing register (reg keyword). The purpose of this is to keep the abstraction clean and abstract away differences between bit-widths etc..
```  
The main function will create an instance for visitor, parse a given file using pyverifo.parse() then visit it with your custom xform: 
(This should be adjusted according to how you are handling error checking/validating the input):   
Finally we provide command line interface via argparsers in python script as follows :  
```python
def main(): # Main function that will run when called from terminal. It takes file name (or -f option) and prints whether transformation was successful or not: 
parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Transforms Verilog/SystemVerilog code')   
   parser.add_argument('-v', '--verilogfile', required=True, help="A verilog file to be transformed")     # Command line argument for input .sv files  (required = true means this parameter must have a value).     
args =  parser.parse_args()    # Parsing command-line arguments   ArgumentParser is one of the inbuilt classes provided by argparsers module which will be used to create an object that can access/work with your inputs and provide outputs .     args are objects correspondingly named after function parameters 
try:        # Try block for error handling. In case if file does not exist or has wrong extension, it raises FileNotFoundError exception otherwise any other exceptions in python will be caught by this try catch blocks then the program terminates throwing an Error message and exit code (1) .     with open(args.verilogfile,'r') as f:  # Opening file using 'with' statement for proper closing after use, similar to how context managers are used in Python - it calls __enter__() on enter of block , then the body is executed and finally calles exit().
    t = parser.parse_from_file(f)   # Parsed AST object from file content .  This can be replaced by pyverilog's method for parsing stream contents or specific files using similar steps as above but it takes a `ReadStream` instance and not filename, in case you want to read directly into Verilog code.
except FileNotFoundError:    # Catch block if file does no exist  . It will print the error message provided by python argparse module on command line while running your script from terminal or console via Python interpreter etc..   Then it ends with exit(1) to terminate program abruptly and give user friendly feedback.
except Exception as e:     # Catch block for any other exceptions that might occur . It will print the error message provided by python argparse module on command line while running your script from terminal or console via Python interpreter etc..   Then it ends with exit(1) to terminate program abruptly and give user friendly feedback.
else:    # Else block if no exceptions occurred in try/except blocks above then only this will get executed .  It means that transformation was successful so we should print 'Transformation Successful' on console otherwise our code might fail due some other reason like incorrect file format etc..   Then it ends with exit(0) to terminate program without giving any feedback.
```     If you want your xform module or pyverilog library can be used further, feel free and happy coding! It will provide a lot more functionality for verilogs/systemVerigos analysis in python due its capability of parsing complex Verilog code into AST then performing transformation on it.
