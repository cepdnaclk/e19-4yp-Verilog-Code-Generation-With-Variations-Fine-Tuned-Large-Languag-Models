Here is a basic example of how you could start to structure your Python module for this task, using PyVerilog and regular expressions (re) in combination with argparse. This will not be an exact 1-to-1 transformation because it's quite complex but should give the main steps on what needs improvement:
```python
import pyverilog as pv
from re import search, findall   # for regex operations and searching patterns within text data types in python.
import argparse                  # command line argument parser to handle user input from terminal/commandline interface 
      
# Visitor Class that implements the visitor pattern: This will allow us execute certain actions on specific elements of our AST    
class XFormVisitor(pv.XilinxVerilogAST):   # Inheriting existing xform patterns for parsing and analyzing verilogs code 
    def visit_module (self, node) : pass      # This will be overridden by the actual visitor methods that apply transformations on our AST nodes    
      
# The main transformation function. It accepts a filepath to input Verilog/SystemVerilog source and applies necessary xformations 
def transform_file(input, output) :   # Defining an action (function in this case). This will contain the actual transformations on our AST nodes    
    pass       # Placeholder for your transformation logic. We'll fill it out later        
          
# The main function that handles user input and runs the xform if necessary 
def run(args) :   # Defining an action (function in this case). This will contain command line argument processing    
    pass       # Placeholder for your additional functionality. We'll fill it out later        
          
# Creating a parser object to handle user inputs from terminal/commandline interface 
parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="Perform transformations on Verilog files.")   # Instantiate the command-line argument processor    
      
args, unknown_args = parser.parse_known_args()      # Handle known arguments (files to be processed) and remaining args 
          
# Main function that runs our xforms   
def main():       
         run(args)          // Call your method here with the parsed argument as input    
       if unknown_args:  
             print("Unknown Arguments : ",unknown_args )      # Printing any extra arguments provided in command line 
if __name__ == "__main__":    # Check whether we are running this code directly or importing it into another script. This is to prevent the main function from being executed if imported as module    
         main()            // Call your method here with no argument (default)       
```  
This Python program reads Verilog/SystemVerilog source files and uses pyverilog's AST pattern, a visitor design-pattern to identify target elements. Then it applies transformations on the identified nodes in an abstract way using Regex for real transformation logic which is expected by XFormVisitor class methods that you need implement according your requirements (like creating test cases etc). The argparse module handles command line arguments from user input, and if necessary prints out any unknown argument(s) provided.
