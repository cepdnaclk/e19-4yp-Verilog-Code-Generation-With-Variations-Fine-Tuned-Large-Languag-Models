The task you've described is quite complex and requires a deep understanding of both Python programming, Verilog/SystemVerilog syntax (which Pyverilog can parse), AST manipulation methods from parsing tools like pyparsing or ast in python standard library for the visitor pattern implementation. 

Here are some steps to achieve this:
1. Use `pyparser` package with a Verilog-like language parser, ie., use regex patterns and semantic actions instead of tokenizing source code into tokens that you'll have no reason but need during parsing process (i.e., the AST). This would allow for more flexibility in your transformation logic without requiring large changes to existing xform framework implementations or having a hard-coded `signal_name` value inside visitor class itself which is quite impossible with current implementation of this task.
2. Implement error handling and validation rules, ie., check if the input file (Verilog/SystemVerilog source code) exists before parsing it using ast from python standard library or other suitable tools depending on your use case. 
3. Generate random values for testing by creating a helper function that generates such arrays of length equal to number elements in target declarations and returns them as lists, which could be used with `random` module's functions like `randint()/choice(), randrange(start[, end]) etc., depending on your requirements.
4. Add different scenarios for testing by modifying the input files or creating new test cases using random values generated in step 3 above and applying transformation to these tests (you can include boundary conditions ie., empty arrays) as per requirement mentioned earlier with use of pyparsing's actions/mutations which is more flexible than regex substitution operations.
5. Make sure your code follows the existing xform framework patterns by properly importing necessary libraries, using visitor pattern for AST manipulation and implementing error handling rules to ensure it works correctly under different scenarios in a valid way with use of appropriate functions from python standard library or other suitable tools depending on how complex transformation is required (this could be more challenging if you want full control over the generated code).
6. Document your implementation using docstrings, argparse for command-line interface creation and make sure all modules/functions are well documented to ensure they're used correctly by users of this package or other developers working on similar projects who might also need a deeper understanding about how things work at some point in the process (additional points mentioned earlier).
7. Finally, write tests for your implementation using unittest module and run these test cases with pytest if you're going to use it as library towards users of this package or other similar projects working on Verilog/SystemVerilog transformations tasks which require complex behavioral scenarios testing in a real-world scenario.
