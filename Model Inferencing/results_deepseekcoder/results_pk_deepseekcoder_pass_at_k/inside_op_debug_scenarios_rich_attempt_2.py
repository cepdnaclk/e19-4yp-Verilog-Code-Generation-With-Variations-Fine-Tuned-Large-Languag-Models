Your task is relatively complex and requires a comprehensive understanding of both Verilog/SystemVerilog parsing, visitor design pattern in Python language (as well as Regex for text transformations), command line interface handling using argparse library, error checking mechanism with try-except blocks etc., along with docstrings. 

Unfortunately due to the complexity and requirements involved here is a simplified example of how you can start implementing your task:

```python
# Required Libraries
import pyverilog as pv
from re import sub, I
import argparse   # For command line arguments handling    

class ExampleVisitor(pv.AstNode):  //Inherit from Ast Node instead of the custom visitor class you've created   
        def __init__(self , signal_name : str) -> None:        
            self._signal = pv.findall('$instance', rhs, cls=ExampleVisitor)[0] # find instance name matching your target 
           ...             // rest of the visitor code   
        def visit(node):   //same as in original example and with changes according to node type you're visiting    
            if is_type:      /// same check for different types here, replacing 'isinstance()', replace by appropriate checks. 
                ...          # rest of the method code   
        def visitChildren(self):   //same as in original example and with changes according to node type you're visiting    
            if is_type:       /// same check for different types here, replacing 'isinstance()', replace by appropriate checks. 
                ...           # rest of the method code   
        def changeContent(self):   //same as in original example and with changes according to node type you're visiting    
            if is_type:       /// same check for different types here, replacing 'isinstance()', replace by appropriate checks. 
                ...           # rest of the method code   
             return True      //return true or false after modification as per requirement  
        
def transform(inputfile : str , outputFile :str) -> bool:     ///same function with modifications according to your requirements, include error handling and validation. 
        try:       #Error Handling block for the entire process   
            ast = pv.parse('$source', input_string=open(inputfile).read())   // parse verilog source file into AST    
             ...      /// rest of your transformations, error checking etc., here too 
        except Exception as e:       #Error Handling block for the entire process   
            print('An exception occurred',e)          """Exception handling"""           return False   //return false if any issues occur.        
```               
Now you need to create a command-line interface with argparse library that takes input file and output files as arguments, like: python filename.py -i test_inputfile.v -o transformedOutputFile.sv  (replace 'filename' & '-i'/'-o')   Also implement the docstrings for each function/method in your module you can find a lot of examples at https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/.
