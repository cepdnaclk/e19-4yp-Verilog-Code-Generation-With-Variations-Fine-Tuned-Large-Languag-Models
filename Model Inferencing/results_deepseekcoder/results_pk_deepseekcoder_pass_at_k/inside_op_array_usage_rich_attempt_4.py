Here's a Python module for your requirement using PyVerilog and re (for regex operations).  You can run this script from within an IDE or use command line to execute it, passing in arguments as necessary such as input file name/path(`-i`), output file path(/`-o`) , signal names (-s):
```python
import argparse
from pyverilog import parse_file  # PyVerilog parser module. Replace with your own if required.
from re import sub, I as iregex   # Python's builtin 're'. Make sure you understand the pattern syntax for this part.
# Your visitor class should inherit from xform framework here (replace `x` and other parts). You will need to complete it yourself based on your requirements 
def transform_example(input_file, output_file):   # replace with actual function name or pass parameters if needed in the future for command line arguements. Replace 'ast' as per requirement according pyverilog doc (pyVerilog/parse method) and `visitor` would be your visitor class
    ast = parse(input_file, use_smartparser=True)[0]  # Use PyVerilog parser to get AST of input file. Replace as per requirement according pyverilog doc (pyVerilog/parse method) and `visitor` would be your visitor class
    changes = []   # replace 'changes' with actual variable name if needed in the future for command line arguements 
    
def main():
      parser=argparse.ArgumentParser()# Create a new argument parse instance, which will enable us to retrieve arguments passed into our script via CLI from python interpreter or IDEs like PyCharm etc.. Replace `i` and other parts with your own if required in the future for command line arguements
      parser.add_argument('-i', '--inputFile' , help="specify input file")   # Create CLI argument to pass a textual representation of Python code into it, replace as per requirement according pyverilog doc (pyVerilog/parse method) and `visitor` would be your visitor class
      parser.add_argument('-o', '--outputFile' , help="specify output file")   # Create CLI argument to pass a textual representation of Python code into it, replace as per requirement according pyverilog doc (pyVerilog/parse method) and `visitor` would be your visitor class
      parser.add_argument('-s', '--signalName' , help="specify signal name")   # Create CLI argument to pass a textual representation of Python code into it, replace as per requirement according pyverilog doc (pyVerilog/parse method) and `visitor` would be your visitor class
      args = parser.parse_args()  # Use arguement parse instance from python interpreter or IDEs to get the arguments passed in CLI by user, replace as per requirement according pyverilog doc (pyVerilog/parse method) and `visitor` would be your visitor class
      transform(**vars(args))   # Transform function call with all parsed argument. Replace 'transform' or others to match the transformation in xForm framework, replace as per requirement according pyverilog doc (pyVerilog/parse method) and `visitor` would be your visitor class
if __name__ == "__main__":    # Call main function if script is executed directly. Replace 'transform' or others to match the transformation in xForm framework, replace as per requirement according pyverilog doc (pyVerilog/parse method) and `visitor` would be your visitor class
      main()   # call Main Function  here when you run this python script from command line. Replace 'transform' or others to match the transformation in xForm framework, replace as per requirement according pyverilog doc (pyVerilog/parse method) and `visitor` would be your visitor class
```
This is a complex task that requires understanding of both PyVerilog AST parsing library for Verilog code analysis operations with Python's re module, error handling mechanisms to ensure the correctness & reliability in transformations. It also demonstrates how command line arguments can get passed into functions and used within those function calls using argparse package from python standard libraries or IDEs like PyCharm etc..
