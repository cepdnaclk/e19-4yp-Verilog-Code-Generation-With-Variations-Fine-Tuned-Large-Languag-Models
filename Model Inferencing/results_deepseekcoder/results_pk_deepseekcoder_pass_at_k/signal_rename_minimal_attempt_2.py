Your requirements are a bit complex and it's unclear what exactly you want to achieve by rename signal in Verilog/SystemVerilog, because different aspects of this transformation might need more specific handling depending on your use case (e.g., renaming within modules or inside functions). However I can provide an example based on the requirements given and some Python code snippets which could be useful to understand how you may implement it in a part:

Python module for rename signal transformation using PyVerilog AST parsing, visitor pattern from xform framework. 
```python
import argparse
from pyverilog import VerilogModule   # Import the parser library of pyverilog to parse verilog files into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for further processing and manipulation in python code using ast module as well, if needed you can also use re.sub() function from Python's standard Library which provides a way to replace substrings with another string
import re   # Import the regular expression library of pyverilog 
from xform import TransformerBase    # Assuming that your XForm framework is using this as its base class for custom transformers. If not, you might need more specific information about how it handles transformations and signal renaming in Verilog/SystemVerilog modules to correctly implement the transformation logic here 
  
class SignalRenameTransformer(TransformerBase):    # Inheriting from your XForm transformer class for custom transformers. If not, you'll need more specific information about how it handles transformations and signal renaming in Verilog/SystemVerilog modules to correctly implement the transformation logic here 
  
def main():     # Main function that will be called when running this script from command line as a standalone program or using pyverilogen run.py filename, where 'filename' is your verilog source file you want transforming in it      
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="Rename signal transformation tool")  # Argument Parser for handling input arguments  
    
def process_file():      // Function to handle the actual renaming of signals within a Verilog/SystemVerilog file, using Pyverilogen AST parsing and Visitor pattern. Here you'll need more specifics about how your XForm framework handles signal rename transformations for correct implementation here
    pass   # Implementation detail depends on the requirements to be given above 
    
if __name__ == "__main__":       // Main entry point of script, it will call main function when running as a standalone program or using pyverilogen run.py filename command line argument provided by user and pass its value into process_file() method for renaming signal transformation 
    args = parser.parse_args()   # Parsing input arguments from the cmdline    
      
if not regexxpr match(r'myoldsignalname', 'MyVerilogModuleContentHere') :      // Regex pattern to identify signals in your module content based on old and new names given as inputs  - Assuming all matches are full words with no partial matchers. If you have specific patterns, adjust this part accordingly  
    print("Signal not found.")     # Significant error handling if signal is missing from the source file or does exist in multiple places but cannot be located by provided pattern      // You may need to expand on these checks and handle exceptions as needed 
else:          
       regexxpr.sub(r'mynewsignalname', 'MyVerilogModuleContentHere')     # Regex substitution of old signal name with new one, assuming all matches are full words without partial matchers (if found). If you have specific patterns and need to handle them differently then adjust this part accordingly  
       print("Signal renamed successfully.")      // Success message if successful in modifying the source file 
```   
In order for these Python code snippets, it is necessary that PyVerilog library (which can be installed via pip install pyverilog) and xform framework are properly set up. Additionally they also assume a particular way of handling renaming signals within Verilog/SystemVerilog files as per your requirements which might need to adjusted based on the exact context in use or structure that verilogs have (e.g., different types for declarations, assignments and references etc.)
