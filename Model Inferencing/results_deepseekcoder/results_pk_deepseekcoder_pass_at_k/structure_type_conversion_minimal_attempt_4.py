Here's a basic example of how you could structure your Python module to meet these requirements using PyVerilog for parsing and visiting tree structures, re (for regular expressions) as pattern matching tooling, argparse library is used in command-line interface handling etc.: 

```python
import pyverilog.ast as pva   # Import the parser from Python's builtin module 'pyVerilog'. You can replace with your own custom implementation if needed for different project use case
from re import search, escape    # Imports regular expressions tooling library 
from argparse import ArgumentParser     # Library to handle command line arguments in python  
import sys     
sys.path.append('./xform')       # Adds the path of your own xForm module directory on which you implement visitor pattern for PyVerilog's AST objects.. 
from my_visitor import MyVisitor     # Replace 'my_visitor', it could be any python file where we will define our custom Visitors methods. It should have a method visit_(node) defined that matches the type of node to which visitor is applied and return something different than None or False for success/failure
``` 
The main transformation function, in this case `convert_signals`:   
This part will be responsible with parsing Verilog source code using PyVerilog's AST objects. After it successfully parsed the file then we would call our custom visitor on that tree structure and if any conversion is needed return True otherwise False  
```python
def convert_signals(filepath):  # File path to your verilog module or source code which you want transformation for   
     try:       # Python's in-built error handling mechanism. It tries the block under it and if fails, goes straight into exception handler section  
         with open ( filePath , 'r') as f :  // Opening your verilog module/source code which you want transformation for   
             text =f .read()              # Reads entire source content of a Verilog Module or Source Code.    
      except IOError:                   // Exception handling mechanism when reading the file fails  
           print('IO Error encountered') 
            return False                 // Returns false on error, as we need to handle this in calling module   
            
         ast = pva .parse(text)        # Parse your source code into an AST using pyVerilog's parser.    
          if not isinstance (ast ,pva._Node):  // If the parsed content isnâ€™t a node then something wrong happened, return false  
               print ('Wrong type of data')     
                return False   
             ast_visitor = MyVisitor()       # Creates an instance for our visitor. Replace 'My Visitors' with your own implementation 
              result=ast_visitor .accept(as) // Applies the custom visit function to AST using defined visitors method and returns True/False on success or failure  
               return true                // Returns Success in case of visiting all nodes, Failure otherwise.   
```     
The command-line interface:    `python filename.py --file=<source file>` where `filename.py is the python script which includes above code and argparse module for parsing arguments from terminal  
Inside main function use ArgumentParser to get input args, parse them into a proper format (like '--help' or '-h')    `usage: filename [-options] [arguments...]  in command line. `    Here usage of argumentparser is simple and straightforward as we want only one file operation from the terminal so it will be handled by our python script  
Finally, docstrings are a good practice for writing code that needs to explain its functionality (or purpose), arguments passed into functions etc., this helps with readability in large projects.    Python's official documentation has more on argparse and also how you can use them inside your project as well: https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html  
Remember to import all the modules at top of a python file, it is good practice for maintainability in large projects  Also make sure that `MyVisitor` class has method visit_<node> defined and returns something different than None or False which will be handled by your custom visitor    Please replace 'my Visitors' with actual implementations.
