import pyverilog as pv  # PyVerilog is a Python bindings to Verilog and SystemVerilog parser library written in C++17 language features only, not python syntax nor standard libraries so you can't use it directly here. However we will provide an example of how the visitor class might be implemented for this case using argparse
import re  # Regex module to search/replace text patterns within strings or files  
from abc import ABCMeta, abstractmethod    # Abstract base classes in Python used as a basis and required by other modules. It is meant specifically because it allows you define methods that must be implemented at the subclass level (abstract method). 
import argparse     # Argument parser for command line arguments  
from ast import parse      # AST module to represent abstract syntax trees in Python, used here as a way of identifying targets. It is part of standard library and not specific python language constructs but available via pyverilog C++ interface 
import sys          # System related functions such as argv (argument variables)  
from typing import List    # Defining types for list operations in Python, used here to indicate what kind elements the lists are going to contain. It'll be useful when we need a data structure that can hold multiple items of different type at once 
import astor         // This library is not maintained anymore but it provides functionality similar as pyverilog C++ AST interface   # Used for pretty printing in Python, used here due its simplicity and compatibility with the existing xform framework patterns. It's a bit outdated nowadays though we can use this instead
    
class XForm(metaclass=ABCMeta):  // Abstract Base Class to ensure that all transformations are classes of which they inherit    # All other transformation modules should be derived from it  
@abstractmethod                     # Decorator for abstract methods, meaning these must still have their method bodies. Inheriting class will need them too!    
def transform(self):                 # Abstract Method to identify the target elements and do transformations on those  in a specific way      
        pass                        # No code needed here at this level due we're using abstract methods  
                                       
class ArrayDeclTransformer (XForm) :    // Inheriting from Xform Base class, because it implements all required functionalities. All other transformation classes should inherit them as well    
def __init__(self):                   # Constructor that sets up the parser and variable initialization  in ctor  
        pass                        # Initially no variables are set here due we're using abstract methods for setup   
        
# Below is a sample of how argparse can be used to get input from command line. It will then use these arguments as parameters when calling transform() function on ArrayDeclTransformer instance 
if __name__ == "__main__" :      # Main section starts here    
        parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Array Declaration Transform')    # Argument Parser creation  
        
# Adding arguments, options and default values as per requirement (e.g., Verilog file name , output directory etc.)  Here we need to add more parameters based on the requirements of this transformation module    
        parser.add_argument('--input', type=str)    # Input File for processing  
        
# Parsing arguments and assign them into variables as per requirement (e.g., input file name , output directory etc.)  Here we need to add more parsing rules based on the requirements of this transformation module    
        args = parser.parse_args()    # parse command line parameters  
        
# Instantiate transformer class and call transform method with parsed arguments (if any) as input file name     
transformer= ArrayDeclTransformer ()  # instantiating new object in python, equivalent of creating a Object instance    
        if args.input:                 # If argument provided then only do transformation else print usage guide  
            transformer.__init__(args.input )    # Initializing with the file name set above as input parameter to this function call     
transformer.transform()  // This will be where we actually perform transformations on AST    
```       The code is quite complex and there are many details not shown here, but I hope it gives you a good idea of how one might begin setting up the transformation module for your xform framework task! If done correctly, this should allow users to pass in an input file (Verilog/Systemverilog) then use PyVerilog's AST parser and visitors systematically replace array declarations with new base types or add width specifications.
