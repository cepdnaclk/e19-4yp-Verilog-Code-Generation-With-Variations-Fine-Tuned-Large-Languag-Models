Here's a Python module for your requirement using PyVerilog, re (for regex), argparse and doctest modules from python standard library to test if our transformation works correctly or not in different contexts such as inside operator usage etc within an `if` statement block with procedural/initial final blocks.
```python 
import pyverilog as pv   # PyVerilog parser module for Verilog code
from re import search, IGNORECASE    # Regex operations and case insensitivity flags
from argparse import ArgumentParser     # Command-line interface toolkit from Python standard library 
import doctest      # Module to run tests in docstrings as part of main program execution.   (pyverilog/doctests)
            
class XformVisitor(pv.XForm):          # Our visitor class that is derived by a pattern we want our xforms compatible with 1:3 ratio, which are used for verification and transformation tasks in pyVerilog framework   (pyverilog/xformation-patterns)
    pass          
    
def main():                         # Main function to test the command line interface of PyVerilog transformer module. This is where our transformations would be implemented 1:3 ratio with verifier and doctest modules, not in actual transformation but for testing purposes instead   (pyverilog/doctor-patterns)
    parser = ArgumentParser(description='PyVerilog Transformer Module')     # Instantiate command line argument module.  This is a basic set up of the argparse toolkit, where we specify what arguments our program will require   (pyverilog/doctor-patterns)
    parser.add_argument('code', type=str, help='Verilog code')     # Argument for input verilog to be transformed 1:3 ratio with pyVerilog and argparse toolkit used here as a basic example of how command line interfaces can work in Python   (pyverilog/doctor-patterns)
    args = parser.parse_args()     # Parse arguments from the console when running this script 1:3 ratio with pyVerilog and argparser module, used to get input code as an argument for our transformations instead of a command line interface   (pyverilog/doctor-patterns)
    doctest.testmod(verbose=True , raise_on_error = True )     # Run tests in the docstrings 1:3 ratio with pyVerilog and argparse toolkit, used to check if our transformations are correct   (pyverilog/doctor-patterns)
    ast = pv.parse(args.code).walk()      # PyVerilog parser module for Verilog code 1:3 ratio with pyVerilog and argparser toolkit, used to walk the AST of our input verilog   (pyverilog/doctor-patterns)
    visitor = XformVisitor(ast.children())     # Our visit function that will be called for each element in ast 1:3 ratio with pyVerilog and argparse toolkit, used to call the xForm visiting on our AST   (pyverilog/doctor-patterns)
    print('Transformed code is : ', visitor.transform())     # Print transformed verilog output for each transformation 1:3 ratio with pyVerilog and argparse toolkit, used to get the result of transformations on our AST   (pyverilog/doctor
!pip install -U git+https://github.com/m-labs/PyVerilog#egg=pyverilog&version_spec=0  # Update PyVerilog library with pip command using version spec to avoid updating the installation if it is already upto date   (requirements)
```    
This module currently only covers basic functionality. It can be extended for more complex requirements such as handling of inside operator in different contexts, procedural and initial/final block scenarios etc within `if` statements or loops with continuous assignments via xform framework pattern by adding appropriate methods to XFormVisitor class based on the requirement mentioned above .
