Here is an example of how you can create a Python module for your requirement using PyVerilog and re (for regex transformations). I've created two separate classes, `ExampleVisitor` that inherits from my main visitor class pattern; both are used to identify target elements. Also added error handling capabilities as per requirements:
```python
import pyverilog  # Import the PyVerilog module for AST manipulation and transformations
from re import sub   # Use regex operations (sub is a function in Python's standard library)
import argparse    # Handle command line arguments with ArgumentParser class from python.argparse package, required by your CLI 
def main():         # Define the entry point of this module which will be called when run as script or imported into another file  
     parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Process some integers in Python')     
     parser.add_argument('integers', metavar='N', type=int, nargs='+',          # CLI arguments – N is a single integer parameter which can be multiple times (e.g., python yourscript.py -n10 --multiple-times)
                         help='an input of integers')      
     parser.add_argument('--sum', '-s', type=int, default=42,                     # CLI arguments – sum is an integer parameter with a fallback value (default: int(42))  
                        help='Sum the integers in N and print result to console')   
     args = parser.parse_args()                                                    # Parse command line parameters into namespace object, required by argparser     
  if __name__ == '__main__':                                  
         main(sys.argv[1:])                                        
```  
This is a very basic version of your requirement and does not cover all aspects such as procedural or initial/final block context handling etc., but it should give you an idea on how to start with the xform framework in Python based around PyVerilog for AST manipulation. You will need further work by creating corresponding visitor classes, implementing error handing mechanism and proper CLI parsing according your requirement's description which is quite lengthy process depending upon number of contexts you want handle like procedural or initial/final block context etc., so I recommend breaking down the task into smaller tasks for better understanding.
