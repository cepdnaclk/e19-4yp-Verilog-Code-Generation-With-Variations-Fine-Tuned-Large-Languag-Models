Here's a simple Python module to perform this task using pyverilog for parsing and analysis, re (for regular expressions) as required by your requirements in creating visitor class that identifies target elements of 'wire', replaces them into reg variables then returns the updated code based on bit width. Also included error handling:
```python
import argparse  # command-line argument parser for arguments passed during run time from cmd line inputs such -i input_file, etc..
from pyverilog import VerilogProgram  # parsing verilog into ast and performing operations on it (visitor pattern) using this library.  
import re    # regular expression module in python to use regex functions for string manipulations if required by your task like finding all wire declarations etc..
from xform_base import XFormBase  # existing transformation base class or any other suitable one where you can define the visitor pattern with specific operations on target elements.  
    
# Visitor Class that inherits from BaseXFORM to perform transformations of 'wire' into reg variables using regex patterns if required by your task like finding all wire declarations etc..     
class WireToRegVarVisitor( XFormBase ):    # replace with the existing transformation framework class or any suitable one where you can define xform pattern.  
     pass                                   # add more methods as per requirement to complete visitor operations on target elements of 'wire' into reg variables using regex patterns if required by your task like finding all wire declarations etc.. 
   
def main(args):                           # command-line interface for execution and arguments parsing from cmd line inputs.  
     parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()     
     parser.add_argument('input', help='Input Verilog file')       
     args = parser.parse_args()   
         
# Function to replace 'wire' with reg in a verilog program and return the updated code based on bit widths/signals   if required by your task like finding all wire declarations etc.. 
def transform(code):      # function where you can add regex patterns for replacing target elements.       
     pass             # replace this method with appropriate transformation logic to be performed using regular expressions or similar operations based on requirement   
         
# Main Function: Execution starts here  
if __name__ == "__main__":           
      program = VerilogProgram(args.input)  # parse input verilog file into ast    
      
try :                                          # exception handling block to catch and handle exceptions as required by your task like finding all wire declarations etc..  
         updated_code=transform (program.parse())    # applying transformations on the parsed code based upon requirement      if not None:  print(updated_code)     elseï¼šprint("Failed")      
except Exception as e :          # custom exception handling block to catch and handle exceptions related your task like finding all wire declarations etc..  
         pass                           
```   
Note that, this is a basic outline of the solution. You need further implementation according to requirements mentioned in above explanation such error checking/handling for command-line inputs as well regex patterns if required by you tasks and so on depending upon your specific use case or requirement set with xform framework pattern here provided only an example purposefully chosen not related actual project logic, it's assumed that a proper class structure is followed. Also PyVerilog does provide the functionality to generate ast from verilog code but this feature may be less useful and complex than using existing transformation frameworks in general programming case where we can achieve similar results directly with pre-defined transformations (like wire variable replacement into reg).
