Below is a Python module you can use as an example to achieve your requirements using pyverilog for parsing and analyzing Verilog/SystemVerilog AST, re (for regex) pattern matching etc., argparse library handling command line arguments of transformation task parameters including signal names list along with new bit widths.
```python 
import sys
from typing import List
try: # Pyverilog requires setuptools and pycparser to be installed if you use pip install -e . in your project directory, otherwise replace the below packages accordingly by using 'pip' command instead of installing it from source code or package repository.  
    from argparse import ArgumentParser 
except ImportError: # Handle Python version differences for setuptools and pycparser libraries (if installed via pip install -e .) usage example with python3-setuptools,python-memoized etc... packages as alternatives if not available in your environment.  
    from argparse import ArgumentParser 
    
def parse_args(): # Command line arguments parsing function for task parameters like signal names and new bit widths (in case of a list) using 'argparse' library, the input should be [signal1:newbitwidth,[...] signallist:[newbitwidth,...]] etc.  .  
    parser = ArgumentParser(description="Change multiple signals at once") # Create an argument-parsing object for our program to handle command line arguments using 'argparse' library, the input should be [-h,-s,--help or --signal] [--newbitwidth,...], etc.  .  
    parser.add_argument('signals', metavar='SIGNAL[BITWIDTH...]', nargs='+') # Add a command line argument for signal names and bit width (in case of multiple signals) using 'argparse'. The input should be [-h,-s,--help or --signal] [--newbitwidth,...], etc.  .
    parser = ArgumentParser(add_help=False, usage="python %s -h for help") # Set the program's name in its own call as a command line argument using 'argparse'. The input should be ["$ python filename"], etc...  
    
def main(): 
    args = parse_args()# Get our arguments from argparser, replace ['-a','--add'][1] with the actual values of your program. In case you want to add more error handling and validation here as well..! This line is just an example on how we can get user inputs in python using 'argparse' library
    signals = args['signals']  # Get signal names from command-line arguments  
    
if __name__ == "__main__": # Start of the main function and entry point to our program. This is where all action happens! Here we just call on functions that implement necessary functionality for transformation task... etc..   
```     
The part in question you're asking about (changing bit widths) would be a separate module or class defined as required, which could contain methods and use of the pyverilog AST library.  The visitor pattern with regex matching is also another aspect to consider for achieving your requirements; however, that falls outside this scope due to its complexity in terms syntax trees manipulation (in case packed/unpacked arrays) handling etc., as well more specifics about how exactly one would implement such a task are out of the realm of what could be considered "automation" and is beyond my current understanding or knowledge.
