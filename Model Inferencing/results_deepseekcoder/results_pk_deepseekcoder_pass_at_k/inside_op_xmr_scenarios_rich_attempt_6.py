Here's a skeleton of how you could structure this task in Python, using PyVerilog for parsing and analysis, Regex to perform actual transformations on text data within your AST nodes or signals (depending upon requirements), argparse for command line interface inputs etc.: 
```python
import pyverilog as pv
from re import sub # For regular expressions in Python. You'll need this module if you plan on using regex to transform the input text data within your AST nodes or signals later.
# If not already present, install it with pip: `pip install python-re
import argparse 

class ExampleVisitor(pv.Module): # Define a visitor class that inherits from pv.Module (or whatever equivalent exists for the task) if you want to use PyVerilog's builtin AST operations and transformations functionality. If not, define your own custom node/signal processing logic here
    def __init__(self, signal_name):  # Initialization of visitor class goes in this method (similar initialization as done above with the Signal or Node you are looking for)  
        self._changes = []     // Define an instance variable that will store changes made to signals/nodes. This is necessary if there's any error handling needed later on, and it could be a list of strings like in your example (`self.signal_name = signal_name`). Note: Use `super()(__init__) instead or the init methods within this class that call super(ExampleVisitor) to use PyVerilog's functionality properly
        self._signals = {}     // Define an instance variable for storing signals/nodes (similar as in your example, same name and type). This is necessary if you want later on do a direct assignment or lookup of these nodes. Note: Use `self[signal_name]` to access the signal when needed
        self._found = False   // Define an instance variable that will store whether we found our target (similar as in your example, same name and type). This is necessary if there's any error handling or validation required later on. Note: Use `self.__init__()` to use PyVerilog functionality properly
        
    def visit(selft, node):   // Define a method that visits the nodes/signals within your AST with pyverilog operations and transformations (similar as in you example). This is necessary if there's any operation or transformation required on these instances of signal names. Note: Use `super().visit()` to use PyVerilog functionality properly
        pass // Implement the logic for visiting nodes/signals here according your requirements, and update self._changes as needed (similar with changes made in example) – If you can't do this directly within visit method of ExampleVisitor class then make it a separate function where pyverilog operations will be performed on each node or signal.
        
def transform_example(inputFile, outputFile):   // Define the main transformation operation (similar as in your example). This is necessary if you want to perform actual transformations within this file according requirements and return whether it was successful/not depending upon result of all operations – If not already defined then define one.
    pass     // Implement logic for transforming inputFile into outputFIle, update self._changes as needed (similar with changes made in example), if there's an error or exception throw appropriately and return False when done successfully else True unless otherwise specified to follow your requirements/example – If not already defined then define one.
    
def main():   // Define a function that handles command line arguments according pyverilog, pymodules etc., (similar as in example). This is necessary if you want the code integrated with existing xform framework patterns when it comes to handling and processing of inputs/outputs – If not already defined then define one.
    pass // Implement logic for command line arguments according pyverilog, pymodules etc., update self._changes as needed (similar examples in example), if there's an error or exception throw appropriately depending on input and output of your main function/command – If not already defined then define one.
    
if __name__ == "__main__":   // Define the command line interface when executed directly, execute all functions etc., (similar as in example). This is necessary if you want to have a clean way for users or other parts of your program/code – If not already defined then define one.    
    pass      // Implement logic here depending on requirements and outputs from main function(s), handle exceptions when needed, update self._changes as used in above functions (similar examples). This is necessary if you want to have a clean way for users or other parts of your program/code – If not already defined then define one.
```   // Implement the logic here depending on requirements and outputs from main function(s), handle exceptions when needed, update self._changes as used in above functions (similar examples). This is necessary if you want to have a clean way for users or other parts of your program/code – If not already defined then define one.
```python   // End the Python file according pyverilog and pymodules etc., provide docstrings, imports required modules as mentioned in example with appropriate comments (similar examples), if there's an error throw appropriately for all parts of your code that depend on these – If not already defined then define one.
```   // Implement the logic here depending requirements and outputs from main function(s) or functions/methods, handle exceptions when needed updated self._changes as used in above methods (similar examples).
