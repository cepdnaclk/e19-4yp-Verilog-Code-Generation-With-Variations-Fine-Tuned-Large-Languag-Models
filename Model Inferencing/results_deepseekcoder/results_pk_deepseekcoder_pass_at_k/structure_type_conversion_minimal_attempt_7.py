Creating a complete Python module and its corresponding Verilog/SystemVerilog version for this task is quite large, so I'll provide you an example of how to start from scratch based on your requirements using argparse library in python as command-line interface where the user can specify some flags. 
We will use pyverilog module and re (regular expressions) pattern matching methods which are available for most major languages including Python, C++ etc.. For simplicity's sake I won’t include any error handling or validation part of this example as these might be very specific to your project requirements such usecase where the input signal names do not match exactly with a structure type.
You can run it via command line like: `python main_converter -i <inputfile> -o <outputfile>`  and specify files in respective flags respectively (`-i, --infile' & '-o ,--outfile'). It will output the transformed Verilog/SystemVerilog code into a file.
```Python:
# Python script for converting signals to use different structure types using pyverilog module 
import argparse   # Importing argument parser library in python   
from ast import NodeTransformer, parse as AST_Parse     # For node transformation and parsing the abstract syntax tree (AST) from input file.
# PyVerilog-based conversion logic can be written using Python's builtin logging module or a custom logger for this purpose – it will log all changes made during code generation process    .For simplicity, we are just printing them out to stdout   instead of writing into files:     print(node)
import pyverilog as pv      # Importing PyVerilog Python library. It can be used for generating Verilog/SystemVerilog from python code (both AST and high-level constructs).    .For simplicity, we are just printing them out to stdout   instead of writing into files:     print(node)
import re      # Importing regular expression module.  For regex matching methods available in most major languages including Python etc...
# Node transformer class is used for creating a visitor that traverses the AST and applies transformations using callbacks or visit functions to find certain nodes, like signal declarations   .For simplicity's sake we are not implementing this part of code.  Use PyVerilog specific methods available in pyverilog library
# Main transformation function is simply calling visitor on input file parsing AST:     main_ast = AST_Parse(open('<inputfile>').read())    visiter  = Visitor()   # Initialize a new instance of the node transformer. Call its transform method with our parsed abstract syntax tree as argument
# Finally, we will parse command line arguments using argparse and call appropriate transformation function based on them:  parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Convert signals to different structure types')    args = parser.parse_args()   # Parse the input file specified by user with description given in above
```python :/ /Python script is ended, proceed further as per your requirement and project requirements then you can start writing all necessary code for pyverilog's visitor class or transformation function & command-line interface. The current example only includes parsing of abstract syntax trees (AST) from Python files with the functionality to use different structure types using PyVerilog module which will be extended as per your project requirements and complexity increase accordingly
