Here is a basic structure for your Python module, assuming that you have already set up pyverilog and created an appropriate visitor class following from XFormPatternBase in accordance to requirements mentioned above (which may not be complete as it depends on how exactly AST parsing/visiting works). 
Please note: this is a very simplified version of what your requirement would look like. For production use, you might need more advanced features and error handling or complex data types for key type selection etc., which are beyond the scope in simple example here (like using multiple associative dimensions while preserving base signal's width).
Also please ensure that pyverilog is installed properly before running this script by checking its version.  If not, you can install it via pip: `pip3 install PyVerilog` . This code assumes the use of Python and a basic understanding on how to write visitors in verilog (specifically with xform framework).
```python
import argparse
from pyverilog import parse_file  # or other appropriate AST parsing function using your toolkit. e.g., PyVerilog, Nuitka etc.
# Your visitor class should inherit from XFormPatternBase and be defined as follows:   
class MyVisitor(XFormPatternBase):  
     def visit_YourElementTypeHere (self , node) :  # replace 'node' with the correct name for your target element type here e.g., a Verilog array, int etc. then implement required methods in it as per requirements mentioned above...    pass              
# The transformation function:  
def convert_to_assoc(filename):      
     tree = parse_file ( filename )            # Parse the file using your toolkit e.g., PyVerilog, Nuitka etc..      return True if success else False        
                                                                                       pass         
if __name__ == '__main__':   argparse . ArgumentParser().add_argument('filename', type=str , help = "Specify the verilog file to convert")  callconvert_to_assoc(arg.get (' filename')) if conversion successful print ("successful" else printed error message
```                                                                                         You'll need further work on argparse for command line interface and also, your visitor should implement necessary methods as per requirements mentioned above...... It is recommended to have a basic understanding of XForm framework before proceeding with the code.  If you are not familiar or if needed help here then please provide more details about how visitors in xform works etc...
