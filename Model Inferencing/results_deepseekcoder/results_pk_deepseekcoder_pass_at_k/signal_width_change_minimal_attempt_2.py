Given your requirements, here's a basic structure of what you might want to do in Python for this task using pyverilog and argparse library modules. Please note that it is important not only correct but also efficient because PyVerilog can be quite slow especially when dealing with large files or complex AST structures:

```python
import re
from typing import List, Tuple
try:  # for Python3 syntax (which requires no explicit 'except' clause)
    from pyverilog.pyv_ast import PyVerilogFileNode as FileAST
    from pyverilog.parsers.stdlib_parser import stdlib_file, StdLibParserContext  # replace with your parser if necessary (default is ast3k)
except ImportError:  
     pass         # no-op for Python2 syntax; not actually used here because we're using `pyverilog` from PyPI. Just importing the module to get its exports in a different way than you want it done by default — that is, without calling an error handler first and then trying to use those modules directly with normal exceptions
     raise   # Python2 style exception handling; not used here because we're using `pyverilog` from PyPI. Just importing the module in a different way than you want it done by default — that is, without calling an error handler first and then trying to use those modules directly with normal exceptions
     raise ImportError("No Module named 'module_name', did you install this package correctly?") # Python2 style exception handling; not used here because we're using `pyverilog` from PyPI. Just importing the module in a different way than you want it done by default — that is, without calling an error handler first and then trying to use those modules directly with normal exceptions
