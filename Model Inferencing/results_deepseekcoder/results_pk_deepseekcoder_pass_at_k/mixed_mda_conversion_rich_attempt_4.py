Here's a Python module for your requirement using PyVerilog and re (for regex). We will need to define two classes, `MDAType` as an abstract base class that can be extended by different types of Mixed Dimensional Array(MDAs), like FixedArray. 
The visitor uses the pattern from existing xforms:
- Visit methods are used for traversing AST (Abstract Syntax Tree). If a node has target declarations with names matching 'signal_name', then it is found and changes made to those nodes in `changes_made` list, appended. 
The transformation function performs the following tasks using PyVerilog: parsing an input file into Abstract Syntax tree; applying visitor on this AST(after performing all transformations); reading content of original file along with doing regex replacements and writing modified output to a new file in same way as existing xform framework.
The command-line interface uses argparse for inputs from user: 
Here's the code which can be used according to your requirements (You need PyVerilog, re libraries also installed):
```python
import pyverilog
from abc import ABCMeta, abstractmethod   # Abstract Base Class in Python3.x -> Metaclass=ABCMeta  for python2 use class decorator @abstractclass instead of metaclass = ABCMeta; from abc import * would also be fine too... as well other methods and properties
import re    # For Regex operations   (Important: pyverilog.parse returns a tuple containing ast_root, directives so you can use list indexing to get the AST)  Use 're' for regular expression match/replace in Python strings using different pattern names defined within your xform framework
import argparse    # For handling command-line arguments (argparsing is built into python3.x and used by default when calling main function if no argument passed to it, thus this can be ignored)  PyVerilog needs a parser for its inputs as well so we use 're' in pyverilog
import os    # To access files/directories (os is Python Standard Library Package -> Importing "py" instead of using from ... import * makes the code cleaner and easier to understand)  PyVerilog needs a parser for its inputs as well so we use 're' in pyverilog
from typing    # For type hint support, you can refer https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/, Python Enhancement Proposal 456 (PEP) for more details on this and other types of information related to python's features
    
class MDAType(metaclass=ABCMeta):    # Abstract Class in PyVerilog -> metaclass = ABCMeta; from abc import * would also be fine too... as well the methods, properties defined here will work for both classes and subclasses.  (You can define other attributes/methods specific to your MDAs)
     __slots__  = ()    # This class only has these fields -> Defining slots helps improve memory usage when you have a large object in Python or C++ where many small variables are involved, using 'immutabledict' is also an option.  (Note: PyVerilog doesn’t support mutable default dictionary unless explicitly defined as such.)
     @abstractmethod    # This makes this class abstract and needs to be subclassed in Python3 -> Defining methods here can help avoid errors when attempting a normal instance of the base MDAType.  (Note: PyVerilog doesn’t support mutable default dictionary unless explicitly defined as such.)
      def target_element(self):    # This is our abstract method to be implemented in subclasses -> Each MDAs class must have this specific implementation here based on their own rules of operations/attributes.  (Note: PyVerilog doesn’t support mutable default dictionary unless explicitly defined as such.)
      def __str__(self):    # This allows for the use 'print' function with MDAType objects -> Defines how to print MDAs in a readable format when used directly, otherwise it will fall back on Python built-in object representation.  (Note: PyVerilog doesn’t support mutable default dictionary unless explicitly defined as such.)
