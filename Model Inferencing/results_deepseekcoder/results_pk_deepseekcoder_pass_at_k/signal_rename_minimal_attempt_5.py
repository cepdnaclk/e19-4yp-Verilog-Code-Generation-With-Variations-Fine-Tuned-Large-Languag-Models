Sure, I can provide a basic skeleton of how you could structure your Python module for this task using PyVerilog and re (regular expressions). However please note that due to Verilog's nature it may not be possible or even feasible with current tools/frameworks in place. This is because the AST-based transformation would require a deeper understanding of how signals are defined, their locations within an entire module etc., which could potentially lead us into more complex problems than what can currently feasibly and efficiently handle directly via Verilog source code alone or even with higher level abstraction layers like Python.

```python 
import pyverilog as pv
from re import search, sub
import argparse   # Handle command-line arguments in python   
    
def find_signals(ast):      
    """Find all signals"""      return [node for node in ast if isinstance (node ,pv.nodes .Port)]

          try: oldname = sub('old', 'new')    return True      except re.error as e         raise ValueError("Invalid replacement")  in case of any error   # Include proper handling and validation        if not isinstance(ast , pv .nodes ...) :     print ("Couldn't parse the Verilog AST."), exit (1 )
