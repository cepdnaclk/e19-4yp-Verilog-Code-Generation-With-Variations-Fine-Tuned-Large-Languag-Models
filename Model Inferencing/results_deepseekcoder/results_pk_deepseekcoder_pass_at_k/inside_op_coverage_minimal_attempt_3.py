Here's an example of how you could implement this task in Python using pyverilog for parsing and ast manipulation, regex to perform transformation on textual data etc.: 

```python
import argparse
from collections import namedtuple
from random import randrange as rr

# Define the test case. This is a simple class we will use later in our main module for creating coverage tests and generating values randomly:  
TestCase = namedtuple('TestCase', 'input output')  # input/output pairs of strings, to be compared at end with expected result (use ==)
RandomValueGenerator =  lambda x : [rr(range(-x//2,x//3)) for _ in range(10)]  
# The Random Value Generator creates a list which contains ten random integers between -X/2 and X / 3. This is just an example of how you could generate these values randomly; your actual generation may be more complex:
def xform_module():    # define the main transformation function (the target for our visitor)  
     def visit(node):      # The visiting method that takes a node as argument and returns some result.  In this case, we just return whatever `visit` receives; in other words 'transforms' it!:
          if isinstance(node, list_type):    # If the current element of our AST matches what will be expected (in Python lists are instances of Node). This could vary depending on your actual node types and how you expect them to match. For example `int` or something similar for integers in a Verilog program:
               return [visit(item) if isinstance(item, list_type) else xform(node[i])  # recursively apply our transformation function on each item of the current node (list), and then join all results together. If an element isn't iterable it just returns that value directly:
          return transforms something similar for other types in your language/ast here!    For example, if `node` is a string you might simply convert everything to lowercase by returning the transformed result of calling str(xform_result). If node doesnâ€™t match list type or isn't iterable then it returns that value directly.
     return visit  # Finally we just call our visiting method on some initial `node` and get its results:   for example, if you pass in a Python function like this (lambda x : x + 1) to the visitor above as your node argument could be any expression - such functions are then passed through visitors that match their respective type. 
```python
# Include command-line interface here! It's quite simple for now, but you might want a more complex setup in future:  
def main():    # define the entry point function (the program starts execution from this)     parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()      parse_result = 0  try...except block to handle exceptions would go here if necessary! finally clause and return statement are also there, just as shown above in `visit` method:
    pass   # This line will be executed when no arguments were passed from command-line interface (i.e., run the program directly)     parser.parse_args()  try...except block would go here if necessary! finally clause is also there, just as shown above in `main` function body:
    pass   # This line will be executed when --help or -v options were passed from command-line interface (i.e., print help/version and exit)     parser.parse_args()  try...except block would go here if necessary! finally clause is also there, just as shown above in `main` function body:
