Here is a basic structure for your Python module, assuming that you have already set up pyverilog and other necessary dependencies in place as per requirements mentioned above (such as pip install). 

```python
import argparse
from typing import List, Union
# Import any required modules from PyVerilog or the existing xform framework patterns.  
try: # for Python versions that support `pyverilog` module directly instead of a package installer like 'pip'
    from pyverilog import parse_expr as pe 
except ModuleNotFoundError:    
    pass            
import re          
# Import any other necessary modules or packages if needed.  
from yourxformframeworkmodulepathhere import XFormVisitor, convertToStructureType # assuming the xformation function is in a module named 'your_transformations' 
                                                        # and it has been imported as `convert` from there already                
                                                                   
def process(filepaths: List[str]) -> Union[bool, str]:    
   """Main driver of your conversion script. Expects file paths to be passed in."""          
   for fp in filepaths:         # iterate over all files provided by user  .         
       content = open(fp).read()        # read the contents from a specific Verilog/SystemVerilog source code     .   
                                                          if not re.match(".*verilog$", fp):   continue      ...        
                                ast= pe (content)              .....           return True, "Successfully converted file"  # Return Successful conversion with message        else:               ......          Error occurred and the error is returned in string format     .      
def main():    """Main function of your CLI interface. Reads files from user input."""         ...            parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Convert Verilog/SystemVerilog source codes')      .....             # Adding Arguments for command line options        ......          args, remainder_args  = parse . read the arguments passed in by Command Line           if not bool (process all files or just one file): print ("Pass at least One File to convert")    ...                   
if __name__ == "__main__":     # The following ensures that main() will only be executed when this script is run directly,  which might also mean running the CLI version.        else:            ......          call process and handle exceptions if any occur       try:. . catch Exception as e : print("An error occurred while processing ", fp , ". Error message ->", str(e))    ...
```   Please replace `yourxformframeworkmodulepathhere` with the path to your xformation function in Python.  Also, please adjust according to requirements and specifics of you project's structure i.e., import paths for necessary modules/packages or functions etc.. The comments provide a basic idea about how things are done here but it would need more elaboration on individual parts based upon the requirement mentioned above (such as handling nested structures).
