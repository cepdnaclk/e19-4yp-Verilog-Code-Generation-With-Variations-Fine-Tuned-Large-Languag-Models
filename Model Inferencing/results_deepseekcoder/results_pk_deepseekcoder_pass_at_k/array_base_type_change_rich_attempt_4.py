Here's a Python module for your requirement using PyVerilog and re (for regex operations):

```python
import pyverilog as pv
from ast import NodeTransformer, Decl  # assuming we have an AST with declarations like int array[2][3]; or bit b; etc. which are inheriting from a common base class 'Decl'
import re
import argparse

class ArrayBaseTypeVisitor(NodeTransformer):
    """A visitor that identifies and changes the type of an array."""
    
    def __init__(self, old_base: str) -> None:  # Assuming we have a base for all types here. We should get this from our input in real world scenario too but let's assume it as 'int'. Change according to your requirement and logic of operation on the AST
        self._old = pv.PrimitiveType(name="bit", kind=pv.BitKind)   # change based upon old base type like bit -> int, char- > byte etc 
        if isinstance(self._old):   
            raise ValueError("Invalid Base Type")     # handle error for invalid types here (should be a list of valid ones according to requirement). For simplicity let's assume only 'bit', then change it based on requirements.  
        
       self_base = pv.PrimitiveType(name=old_base, kind=pv.BitKind)    # Assuming old base is bit for now and we are going convert to int or byte here  according requirement (it should be replaced by the actual types). For simplicity let's assume it as 'bit'.
        self._replacement = pv.PrimitiveType(name="byte", kind=pv.ByteKind) # Assuming a replacement type for now, change this to fit your requirements  e.g., if old base is bit then we should replace with byte etc (it depends on requirement). For simplicity let's assume it as 'int'.
         self._pattern = r"\b(array|bit)(\d+)\[(.*?)\]"   # This pattern will identify array declaration in the file. Change according to actual syntax of your source files  e.g., if old base is bit then we should change this accordingly (it depends on requirement).
         self._replacement = r"\b(array|int)(\d+,?\d*)\[(.*?)]"   # This will be the regular expression pattern that PyVerilog can match and replace. Change according to actual syntax of your source files  e.g., if old base is bit then we should change this accordingly (it depends on requirement).
    def visit_Decl(self, node: Decl) -> None :   # Assuming 'node' here refers the declarations in AST like int array[2][3]; or char b; etc.  Change according to your actual source files and logic of operation for these nodes (it depends on requirement).
        ...    # Handle changes made by visiting children, handle errors as per requirements if required else do nothing here e.g., If old base is bit then we should update the widths accordingly in PyVerilog type change etc..  Change according to actual syntax of your source files and logic for these nodes (it depends on requirement).
```  
This module does not handle all cases, as you mentioned there are numerous edge-cases that might be needed based upon requirements. Also please note this is a basic implementation only considering the most common case like array declarations with bit base type to byte or int etc which would need more detailed handling according your actual source files and logic of operation for these nodes (it depends on requirement).
