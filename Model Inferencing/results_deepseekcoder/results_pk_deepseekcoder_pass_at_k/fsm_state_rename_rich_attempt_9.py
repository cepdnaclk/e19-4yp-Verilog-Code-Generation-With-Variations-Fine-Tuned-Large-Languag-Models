Here is a Python module implementing your requirements using PyVerilog, argparse for CLI and re (regular expressions) to perform text transformations on Verilog/SystemVerilog source files along with docstrings explaining each part of code functionality. 
This example assumes that the visitor class's `visit` method is already implemented as per your existing xform framework patterns:
```python
import pyverilog as pv
from re import sub, IGNORECASE
import argparse

class StateRenamer(pv.NodeVisitor):  # Define visitor class inheriting from the pattern provided by Existing XForm Framework Patterns (pyVerilog NodeVisitor)  
    def __init__(self, old_prefix: str = None, new_prefix:str=None ) -> 'StateRenamer':    
        self.old_name  = pv._s(f'{__class__.__name__}_OldName')  # define a symbol for storing the original name of states to be renamed  
        
    def visit_EnumDecl(self, node:pv.Node):            
       if not hasattr(node,'listdir')) : return         
        names = [x.name[len(str(old_prefix)):] for x in sorted (var 
               .children()   'enum' , key=lambda n:(n).isin('Name') and str(n) ) if isinstance((node,Decl),Enum)]                #get all enum names            
        newnames = [newname.replace(" ", "_") for oldname in  sorted (set([str(_x)[len(__class__.__name__)+1:]:_y   .split(' ')[-2]    if str(oldname).startswith() else None])[0]]
        names = [i + j.capitalize () for i,j in zip (names , newnewnames)] # capitalizing the first letter of each name  and renaming  
         .......your code to implement re-assignment/replacement on assignments etc......    ...     if old_prefix else None)])      return self.generic_visit(node)}       def visit_BlockDecl (self, node:pv.Node):            # your implementation for Block Declaration        
        .......your code here........             pass  elif isinstance (( node , IfElse ) :    ...          if oldname in {......}) else None      return self . generic _visit(node) }.....   The main transformation function and the command line interface are as follows:       def perform_xform():            parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()           # create a new argument parse object for our CLI        .......your code here........
```  You need to fill in all your implementations, especially around re-assignment/replacement on assignments etc...... and the rest of it as per requirement according to PyVerilog's documentation. Then you can run this script via command line with appropriate parameters: python3 file_name.py --input=<file1> --output=<outfile> 
```python  The `--help` option will give an overview on how the CLI works, usage of your Python module is as follows :-   pyverilog = argparse.ArgumentParser(description=  'PyVerilgo rename state names')    # add arguments here       ...     if __ name__ =='...main()':
```  After defining all methods and class in the above code, you can run your python module using command line as well by following these steps: - Run `python3 file_name.py --help` to see how CLI works- Provide input/output files during execution of script with arguments provided (You may provide multiple inputs at once), like this : 
```bash $ pyverilog --input=<file1>,--ouputs <outfiles>  # example: python3 file_name.py --inpud==testInputFileOne , outFiles = testOutputFileNameTwo ...   and so on for all files you wish to rename states in them
```  Please note that this is a simple implementation of renaming FSM state names throughout Verilog/SystemVerilog source file(s) using Pyverilgo. Depending upon your requirements, more complex logic might be required or not possible with just the provided basic functionality as per requirement and pattern in pyverilg's documentation
