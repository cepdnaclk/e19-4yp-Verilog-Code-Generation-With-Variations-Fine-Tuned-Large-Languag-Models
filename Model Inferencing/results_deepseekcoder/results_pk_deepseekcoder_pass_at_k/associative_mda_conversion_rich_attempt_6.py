Here's a possible implementation of your requirements, using PyVerilog and Python as you requested in my response to this task (the example given above is not relevant due to some parts being unclear): 

```python
import pyverilog
from re import sub # Importing the regex substitution function from python's built-in module 're'. This will be used for text transformations.
import argparse   # For command line argument parsing in Python. You can use it to get options and arguments via a program when run by users or other programs using your script as part of their interaction with the system they are running on, ie., calling from terminal/command prompt etc.. 
    
# Creating an argparse object for command line argument parsing:  
parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Convert arrays to associative multi-dimensional array')    # Argument parser is used when the program starts running, it defines what arguments are needed from users (via terminal/command prompt) etc.. 
    
# Adding command line options for file names:  
parser.add_argument('input', metavar='INPUT-FILENAME', type = str , help =  'The input Verilog source code filename')    # Argument parser is used to get the user inputs (file name etc.) when program starts running, it defines what arguments are needed from users via command line/terminal.. 
parser.add_argument('output' metavar='-O', type = str , help =  'The output Verilog file')    # Argument parser is used to get the user inputs (file name etc.) when program starts running, it defines what arguments are needed from users via command line/terminal.. 
    
args = vars(parser.parse_args())   # This will give you a dictionary of your options and their corresponding values as accessed in args variable by argparse module at run time   
```       
Here is the visitor class using PyVerilog:     `ExampleVisitor() ` (note that, this example assumes an existing AST structure with nodes representing declarations)  :  
    
The transformation function would look something like below in Python. In your case you'd have to define a specific rule for converting arrays into associative multi-dimensional array:     `transform_example() ` method which will be implemented as per requirements above, and the command line interface could also take input options via argparse module :
    ```python   # This is how it can start from your framework. But keep in mind you need to implement all rules according with xform specifications given below:  .   `ExampleVisitor() ` class should inherit PyVerilog's AST node and visitor pattern, which will be used for identifying target declarations (array references), transforming them into associative array syntax ([key_type]) as per requirements. This task requires a deep understanding of the specific Verilog language/AST you are working with in order to implement this correctly:
    ```python   # Here is how your visitor class should look like  : `ExampleVisitor()` Class (Inheritance from PyVerilog's AST Node) that will be used for identifying and transforming declarations. This task requires a deep understanding of the specific Verilog language/AST you are working with in order to implement this correctly:
    ```python   # The transformation function would look something like below : `transform_example()` Method (Implementation as per requirements above) that will be used for executing transformations on AST based node objects, according your requirement and xform specifications given before. This task requires a deep understanding of the specific Verilog language/AST you are working with in order to implement this correctly:
