Sure, I can provide a basic skeleton of how you could structure your Python module for this task using pyverilog and argparse libraries to create command line interface or vice versa depending on what is required in real-world scenario. However please note that the actual implementation will be much more complex because it would require handling various signal types, attribute modifications etc which are beyond scope of simple code snippet here:

```python
# Importing libraries and modules 
import pyverilog as pv
from argparse import ArgumentParser   # Python's in-built module for command line argument parsing.
                                              
class SignalTransformer(pv.Xform):    # Define a visitor class that extends the XForm from PyVerilog 
                                        # This is where you will write your code to change bit width of signals  
     def __init__(self, signal_name: str , old_width : int) -> None:         
         self.signal = pv.find(pv.SignalDeclarationPattern(), '$SIGNAL')  # Find the Signal Declaration in AST          
                                                                             if not self.signal or len (self . signal ) != 1   else ...    
    def visit_assign(__signals):         // Visit assign statement, where __assignds is a list of signals assigned to an expression           
        for _sig in  __Signal:      // Iterate over each Signal            
           if oldWidth == signal.width :   // If width matches replace it with new Width             
               return True       // Return true on successful change          elif not isValidNewSize(new_size):     // Or throw exception for invalid size                  raise ValueError('Invalid New Size')  else ...                     self .signal[0].setWidth (width)    # Set the signal's width if success        
        return False                 # Return false on failure          elif not isinstance(__signals, list ) :     // Raise exception for incorrect type           raise TypeError('Incorrect Signal Assignments')  else ...                     new_assign.accept (__Signals)   # Recursive call to accept method if necessary
      def visit(self , *args):         // Visit any node in AST, where args are all the arguments passed down from parent       return self .visit (*argcus)/2    }  __main_transformer = SignalTransformer()   # Create instance of visitor class for transformation       
      def main():             
          parser=ArgumentParser(description='Change signal bit width.')     // Define a command line argument      
                                                                           args, remainder =parser . parseArgs('-s {}-w {}'.format (signal_name , oldwidth))  # Parse the arguments given at run time    if not all([args.signName and arges.oldWidth]):      raise ValueError ('Missing signal name or width')         main ()  
```     In real world case, you would need to handle exceptions appropriately (like providing user-friendly error message) based on what kind of failure happened during the transformation process like 'signal not found', invalid new size etc. You should also have a mechanism for showing help/usage details when required by command line arguments and so forth in your codebase as well, which are pretty much covered above with argparse usage examples . Also you would need to provide an implementation of `isValidNewSize` method that verifies if the new size is valid or not.
