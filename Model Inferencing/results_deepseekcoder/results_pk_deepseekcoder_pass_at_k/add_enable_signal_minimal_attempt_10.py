Here is a Python module for your requirement using pyverilog, re (for regular expressions), argparse and textx library respectively to implement an incremental counter transformation in Verilog/SystemVerilog syntaxes considering their specificities when it comes about the enable signal control of a Counter. 
```python
import sys   # for exit() function usage, etc...
from pyverilog import PyVerilog as pv    # verilog parser and emitter module from 'pyverilog' library by @socallinux
from textx import LanguageServerPlusClient  # To interact with the language server (lsp) in a pythonic way. Includes grammar rules, autocompletion etc...  
import argparse    # command line argument parsing module for easy script execution via CLI parameters like input and output file names or paths..etc....:).args = parser_obj.parse_args()  Here args is a namespace object which holds the parsed arguments from cmdline, you can get those values by using vars(vars) function e.g., print (vars().get('<argument name>'))  
import re    # for regular expressions module...re in python works like grep command to find and manipulate strings based on patterns..  etc....:).match(), search() functions, grouping ...etc.............# Here we are using the .findall(pattern , string) method which is a good way of matching multiple occurances.

class CounterTransformerVisitor (LanguageServerPlusClient):    # Defining visitor class for xform   pattern...  ) as super(): in Python, you can call parent classes methods from child's constructor by using the syntax 'super().__init__(...)'. But here we need to override it.
