Here's a basic example of how you could structure your Python module to achieve this task using pyverilog for parsing and visiting, regex for transformation operations in Verilog syntax, argparse library as command-line interface handling etc.: 
```python
import re
from ast import NodeTransformer, Decl # assuming existing declarations are of type 'Decl' from the PyVerilog package. If it is different then replace with appropriate class name accordingly.
try:   # Ensure pyverilog can be imported if not available in this python environment (for example a docker image).  This might throw an error, so we wrap our code inside try/except block to handle exceptions as needed. Also import the necessary modules from PyVerilog's ast package
    from pyverilog import parse # assuming you have installed it using pip install or equivalent command in Python environment (for example python -mpip install)  If not available then replace with appropriate class name accordingly and its function if different as per your requirement.  
except ImportError:    
       print("Please ensure that pyverilog is properly imported") # Printing error message for unsuccessful imports, adjust this according to requirements of the project or user experience in case it fails (show appropriate messages).  You can use sys module's exit() function here too.   If you want your code executed when an ImportError occurs then replace "print" with exception handling logic as needed and if not possible at all for unsuccessful import, just ignore the error using pass statement or simply continue execution of other parts (if any).
    
class ExampleVisitor(NodeTransformer): # Inheriting NodeTransfomer from pyverilog's abstract class to work with ast Nodes.  Replace 'Decl', if not same as your existing declarations then replace accordingly in the following line too assuming it is a node of type Decl and has name attribute for example
    def __init__(self, signal_name): # Initialize visitor using initializing parameter (signal) that we want to find. If you need multiple signals or different kinds/types just add more parameters here as needed in the constructor 
        self._node = None     // assuming your node is of type Node and it will be assigned by visiting methods if not same replace accordingly on line too, Initialize changes_made attribute with empty list for storing operations performed. Also initialize signal found to False (or similar) Assume all other attributes as per requirement according the existing declarations in ast
     def visit(self):  // Assuming visitor method has 'visit' functionality which can accept node parameters and perform operation on that if needed, make sure it accepts correct parameter types for your requirements. Also replace with appropriate logic when a signal is found or not as per requirement (add to changes_made list).
```   This part of the code will be able handle all basic cases provided in question but still needs more customization according actual design and constraints that come up while implementing this from given context ie: handling bounded vs unbounded queues, multiple dimensions etc.  You might need help with different classes or methods for AST manipulation if your use-case is not straightforward to follow the requirements mentioned in question above as pyverilog does a lot of abstract work under hood which can be complex and hard to debug but also it's usually recommended way when working on ast transformations.
