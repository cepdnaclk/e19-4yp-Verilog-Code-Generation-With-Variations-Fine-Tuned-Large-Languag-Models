Here's a Python module for your requirement using pyverilog, re (for regex), argparse and XFormFramework from pysimulaqtor as base classes/patterns in order to follow specific task requirements mentioned above : 

```python
import sys
from PyVerilog.parser import parse_file
from xformframework import * # Include all the required patterns here for reference purposes only, replace with actual file paths and names if applicable
# Import other necessary modules/packages as needed... For instance: re (for regex), argparse etc., 
import unittest   
  
class XFormVisitor(XformPattern): # Define your visitor class that extends the pattern from existing xforms here ... replace with actual file names and patterns if applicable.    
       pass                   # Handle target elements based on their types/syntax... For instance: 
                                # def visit_ifstmt() : return SomeResultObject();  
class XForm(unittest.TestCase):     
    @staticmethod          
    def main():            
        parser = argparse.ArgumentParser("XformTest")                 
                                                           
                                                                      
def xfm(*args, **kwargs) -> bool:                          # Main transformation function to be defined here...  Here you should apply your transformations on the AST of Verilog/SystemVerilog file and return true if successful else false     
    pass  
if __name__ == "__main__":                               
                                                           
        parser = argparse.ArgumentParser("XformTest")                  # Command-line interface definition...  Here you should provide some arguments that will be used by your main function to run tests or perform other actions                  
                                                                      
    def test_case(self):                                  # Test case defined here (replace with actual file names if applicable)     
        pass  
if __name__ == '__main__':                              
                                                           
unittest.main()                                           
``` 
This module is a starting point and you would need to fill in the details based on your requirement such as how transformations are applied, what kind of ASTs/parsing libraries pyverilog supports etc., then use argparse for command-line arguments which will be used by main function. You'll also probably want more comprehensive docstrings if there is any complexity involved with this module e.g in the XFormVisitor and xfm functions above, as well as your tests (test_case).
