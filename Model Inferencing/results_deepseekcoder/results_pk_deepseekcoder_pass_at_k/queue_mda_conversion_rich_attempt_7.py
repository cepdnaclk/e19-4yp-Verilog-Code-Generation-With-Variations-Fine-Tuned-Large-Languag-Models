In order to implement this, we need a few steps and tools that are not part of Python's standard library but must be installed separately (like pyverilog). 
- PyVerilog is used for parsing Verilog code into an abstract syntax tree(AST), which can then be traversed using our visitor. This tool doesnâ€™t come with python, so we need to install it manually via pip: `pip install pyverilog` (only if you are working on a Unix-like system).
  
Here's the Python module for your requirement based upon given requirements and tools used above : 
```python
