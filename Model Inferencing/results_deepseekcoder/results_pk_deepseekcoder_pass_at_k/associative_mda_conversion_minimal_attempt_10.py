Here is a basic implementation of your request using Python and pyverilog for parsing Verilog into an abstract syntax tree (AST). This design will support converting arrays to associative multi-dimensional arrays, but note that it's not fully implemented as there are no specific requirements or patterns in the xform framework.

The module `pyx_convert` is a visitor class which uses pyverilog for parsing and transformation: 
```python
import re
from abc import ABCMeta, abstractmethod   # Abstract Base Class (ABC) to enforce subclasses have implemented certain methods in Python3+.

class NodeVisitor(metaclass=ABCMeta):    # PyVerilog AST node visitor base class – all nodes should be visited by the same object because they share a common interface, and it needs an abstract `visit_xxx` method to implement that shared behavior for each specific type of Verilog code.
     @abstractmethod   def visit(self): pass    # Must overridden in subclass! – PyVerilog will call this when visiting a node (and all its children). The function is expected not to return anything, but it should change the state or result of some operation on nodes that are passed as arguments.
     @abstractmethod   def get_result(self): pass    # Must be overridden in subclass! – PyVerilog will call this when visiting a leaf node (no children). The function must return something, and it should not change the state of nodes that are passed as arguments.
     @abstractmethod   def get_width(self): pass    # Must be overridden in subclass! – PyVerilog will call this when visiting a leaf node (no children). The function must return something, and it should not change the state of nodes that are passed as arguments.
     @abstractmethod   def get_type(self): pass    # Must be overridden in subclass! – PyVerilog will call this when visiting a leaf node (no children). The function must return something, and it should not change the state of nodes that are passed as arguments.
     @abstractmethod   def get_key(self): pass    # Must be overridden in subclass! – PyVerilog will call this when visiting a leaf node (no children). The function must return something, and it should not change the state of nodes that are passed as arguments.
     @abstractmethod   def get_keytype(self): pass    # Must be overridden in subclass! – PyVerilog will call this when visiting a leaf node (no children). The function must return something, and it should not change the state of nodes that are passed as arguments.
     @abstractmethod   def get_base(self): pass    # Must be overridden in subclass! – PyVerilog will call this when visiting a leaf node (no children). The function must return something, and it should not change the state of nodes that are passed as arguments.
      ... etc .......   // other methods can also remain abstract for further expansion if needed by specific use-cases or features in xform module – such things might include: handling nested arrays (nested array to associative), error checking, validation and more..//    .. The method should accept an instance of the visitor as first argument.
```   // PyVerilog AST node visitors can be subclassed by each specific type Verilog code they are interested in visiting – such implementations will include: for int arrays or others based on key types, etc...    .. The method should accept an instance of the visitor as first argument.
```python
import pyverilog   // Import PyVerilog Python module to parse and analyze Verilog code into AST structure – all further methods related with parsing will be implemented in this subclassed object (Visitor Class) that uses a pointer towards An Abstract Syntax Tree created by the parser. The method should accept an instance of visitor as first argument, which is needed when visiting nodes using different visitors or operations on them
```   // PyVerilog AST node visit methods – all must return something based upon current state and passed arguments to adjust accordingly (Pyverilog will call this for each visited child in a particular parent) - the purpose of these functions are not clear from first glance as it is abstract. But if understood, they should be implemented such that when called with an instance visitor argument, PyVerilog calls visit methods on AST nodes visiting different parts and manipulates state based upon what has been found during parsing
