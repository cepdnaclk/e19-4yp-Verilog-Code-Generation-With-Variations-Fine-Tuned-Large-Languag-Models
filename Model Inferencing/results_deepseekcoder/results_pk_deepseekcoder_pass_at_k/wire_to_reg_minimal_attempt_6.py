Here's a simplified version of how you could structure such module in Python, using pyverilog for parsing and ast transformations to replace 'wire' declarations into ‘reg’ ones like this example should do it assuming we have an abstract AST object that has similar methods. The code below is just the skeleton:

```python
import argparse
from typing import List, Union
import pyverilog as pv
import re
# Import other necessary modules here based on your requirements 

def parse_arguments():     # Parsing command line arguments with ArgumentParser.  
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Transforms wire variables into regs')     
                                                                                         
parser.add_argument('verilogfile', metavar='VERILOGFILE','the verilog file to be processed ', type:str)  # Adding argument for Verilog File   
args = parser.parse_args()     # Parses the arguments passed during command line execution  
return args     
# Returns parsed variables after parsing, raising appropriate error if needed (like wrong format of input file etc.) .      
```                         
The `argparser` is used to parse and validate user inputs on run-time.  The parser should be able handle a variety types in the command line arguments that will then allow for proper use cases such as parsing Verilog files, replacing 'wire' declarations into regs etc..        Please note this example does not include any error handling or validation and is purely an initial mock up of how you could structure your program.
