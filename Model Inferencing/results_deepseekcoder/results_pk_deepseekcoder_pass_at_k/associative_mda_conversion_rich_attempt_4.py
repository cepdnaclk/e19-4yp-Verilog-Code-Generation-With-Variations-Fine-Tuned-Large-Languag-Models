Here's a Python module for your requirement using PyVerilog and re (for regex transformations):

```python
import pyverilog as pv
from collections import defaultdict  # For associative arrays handling
import argparse   # To handle command-line arguments from the user.
import os, sys    # Path module to get current working directory in OS independent way (used for file and folder creation)
import re        # Regular expression operations using Python's builtin package "re" 
                 # For handling regex transformations of array declarations into associative arrays syntax [key_type]  
                 
# Existing xform framework patterns from which this module inherits:   
class ExampleVisitor(pv.visitors.NodeVisitor):    
        def visit_(self, node) -> None or pv._astnode_.Module :      # Inherit the pattern here (ExamplePatterns class is a part of pyverilog library that contains all patterns.) 
            ...   # Your code goes Here in this section.   
                 pass            
        def visit(self, node) -> None or pv._astnode_.Module :      # Inherit the pattern here (ExamplePatterns class is a part of pyverilog library that contains all patterns.) 
            ...   # Your code goes Here in this section.   
                 pass            
    
# Main transformation function:          
def transform_example(input_file, output_dir):     
        ast = pv._parse_(filename=os.path.join("", input_file))  # Parse AST by using pyverilog _parser_.   (Include the full path of file including filename)   
         ...     # Your code goes Here in this section for actual transformation operations, and error handling as per requirement above..      pass            
        return True                          # Returning a boolean success/failure.  This is just an example , you can modify it according to your requirements (If everything went fine).    False  
          ...     # Your code goes Here in this section for actual transformation operations, and error handling as per requirement above..      pass            
               if __name__ == "__main__":          
                parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="Convert arrays to associative multi-dimensional arrays.")              def add_argument() : # Add command line arguments here by using python's inbuilt module 'argparser'.          .add\_required(['input', ‘output’])     return   run   
```       The above code is a skeleton and requires additional functionalities to be filled. It would include the implementations for all methods that need implementing, such as `visit_` , etc., in your case also handle command-line arguments from user using argparse module if required by task requirement or error handling should have been added according to requirements above..
