Here's a Python module for your requirement using PyVerilog and re (for regex operations):

```python
import pyverilog as pv
from typing import List, Tuple
try:  # only if you have python3-re2 library installed. If not use "".join(list) in place of list to join string elements into a single str instead """".""" """, etc... below"""  
    from re import findall as rfind_all, IGNORECASE  # using 'I' flag for case insensitive search. Useful if you want match regardless of the casing in input data or regex pattern respectively */    
except ImportError:                     """" """,""" "".join(list)"""   Python3-re2 is not installed, use plain re instead.""" 
    import re as rfind_all       # Default case for python < 3.x*/          If you want to join string elements into a single str (default), uncomment the line below and comment out 'IGNORECASE' flag above */   """" """,""" "".join(list)"""
