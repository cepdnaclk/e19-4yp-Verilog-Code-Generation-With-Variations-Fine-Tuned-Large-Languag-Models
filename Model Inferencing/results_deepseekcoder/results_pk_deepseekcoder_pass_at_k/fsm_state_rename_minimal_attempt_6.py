Here's a simplified version of how you might go about creating such a module in Python using pyverilog for parsing and rename state names, argparse to handle command line arguments etc.. This is an example only covering part where we implement renaming function with error handling (it may need more complex code).
```python 
import sys
from collections import defaultdict  
sys.path.append('/usr/local/lib') # Add path of pyverilog module here, you can use it as an example   
    
class RenameStateVisitor(object):     
# Your existing visitor pattern goes into this class 
pass       
        
def start_visit(astnode, *args) :       def visit_(self , node:ASTNodeType ) -> bool   pass # your function definition here    return False     endfunction" (You will have to replace ASTNodeType and FunctionDefinition according to actual syntax in the given problem).
def process_state_renaming(old, new):  oldstates = defaultdict()          for stateName , nodeList in astnode.children['FSMDecl'].body[1].items():             if isinstance (item [0] . type == 'Ident' :               itemname=str((PyVerilogParser)ASTNodeType)[3:]
if oldstates.__contains__(stateName):          print ("State already exists: " + stateName )  # replace here with the error handling part.           continueold = nodeList[0]             newn = PyVerilogTools().create_astnode('Ident' , [new])            renameNode=PyVerilogAstRename( old, new)
```     The above code is a very simplified version of what you are asking for. It does not include all the functionalities described in your requirements (such as renaming within case statements and comparisons), but it should give an idea on how to approach such problem using pyverilog library which can be extended according with more specific needs required by this task ie., error handling, state rename etc.
