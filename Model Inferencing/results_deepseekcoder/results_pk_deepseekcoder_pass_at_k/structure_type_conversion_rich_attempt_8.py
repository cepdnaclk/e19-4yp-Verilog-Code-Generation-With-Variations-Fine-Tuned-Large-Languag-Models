Here is an example of how you can implement this task using Python and pyverilog library, which provides a tool to parse Verilog/SystemVerilog ASTs in C++ style (based on Pyparsing).  The visitor class will use the `pyverilog` module for parsing. For error handling validation is also included:

```python
import pyverilog as pv
from argparse import ArgumentParser, FileType
from os.path import basename

class SignalVisitor(pv.Module):  # PyVerilog visitor class that inherits from a module (like SourceUnit) for easier access to its children's attributes and methods like 'children()'. We inherit it because we are looking at the AST of Verilog code, which is an abstract syntax tree representation
    def __init__(self):  # Initialize changes made list in visitor instance. It will be used later after visiting all nodes with this particular visit function (similar to a callback) so that information can always get back if needed for further processing or saving the results into file etc.. Here we also check whether signal was found and store it
        self._changes_made = []  # List of changes made in visitor instance. It is created when visiting method calls this list with add function to keep track on all modifications done by visit functions (similar as a callback) for further processing or saving the results into file etc.. Here we also check whether signal was found and store it
        self._signal_found = False  # Boolean that checks if target signals were not None. It is created when visiting method calls this variable with True/False assignments to keep track on all modifications done by visit functions (similar as a callback) for further processing or saving the results into file etc.. Here we also check whether signal was found and store it
        super(SignalVisitor, self).__init__(pv.parse(''))  # Parse AST from input source in constructor so that visitor can start visiting nodes with parse function (similar as a callback) at the same time for setup of this instance when calling visit method or similar to arg-parser
        if not hasattr(self, 'name'): self._changes_made.append('Error: SignalVisitor missing name attribute')  # Add error message about lacks attributes in visitor class (similar as a callback) because we are looking at AST of Verilog code which is an abstract syntax tree representation
        if not hasattr(self, 'list'): self._changes_made.append('Error: SignalVisitor missing list attribute')  # Add error message about lacks attributes in visitor class (similar as a callback) because we are looking at AST of Verilog code which is an abstract syntax tree representation
