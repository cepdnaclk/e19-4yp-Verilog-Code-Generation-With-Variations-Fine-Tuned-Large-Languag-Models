Given your requirements, here is a high level overview of how you could structure this Python module for XMR and Function call index tests using PyVerilog (a python library to parse Verilog/Systemverilog).  Note that I'll use `pytest` as the test framework in order to create some example assertions.

1) Import necessary modules: You need pyverilog for parsing, re module will be used with regex functions and argparse is needed so you can pass command line arguments from python script (input_file & output file). 
```python
import sys   # For system libraries like exit() etc.
from ast import parse as a_parser    # From 'ast' library, for parsing the source code into an abstract syntax tree with functions re and sub to replace substrings in strings; from lib2to3.pystatic import PyErr — Error reporting utilities are also necessary (PyVerilog uses it).
import pyverilog   # A python interface of verilog/systemverilog parser, for handling the ast nodes and transformations according to your requirements as per xform framework design pattern mentioned above. You'll need a visitor class which will inherit from this base type that includes all methods you may require in order make modifications on parsed Verilog code structure (like signal found or not etc.).
import argparse   # For command line argument parsing to provide input and output files as arguments at runtime — This is necessary for your requirement. ArgumentParser creates an instance of the CommandLineInterface class, which stores information about program's options/arguments from Python script’s caller function(argv).
```
2) Visit method: In visitor you need to check if a node has certain attributes (like name being equal to signal_name), then append change made message in changes list. Also visit all children nodes recursively for traversing the entire code tree, following similar pattern as xform framework example provided above using .children() function from ast module of Python standard library which returns iterator over childless node's successors (childnodes) and their descendants(succesor/descendant).
```python
class ExampleVisitor:   # Your visitor class should inherit this pattern. 
    def __init__(self, signal_name):     # This method is called when a new instance of the object created using constructor (__init__) . Here you initialize your objects with data or make sure that they are in their initial state before anything else happens at all times during construction/creation phase. 
        self.signal_name  = signal_name   # Initialize attributes here if needed by extending this class, e.g., for storing found signals' names etc.. This should be done on initialization step of your object or in the same function where you pass these arguments to constructor (ExampleVisitor("mySignalName")).
        self.changes_made = []   # Initialize changes made list here if needed, e.g., for storing messages about what modifications have been performed so far during transformations phase.. 
                                  This should be done on initialization step of your object or in the same function where you pass these arguments to constructor (ExampleVisitor("mySignalName")). It will initially hold empty list right now as we don't yet make any changes. You can append messages with `self.changes_made` if needed later after visiting method has finished its execution and all modifications are made, e.g., self.changes_made = ["Found my signal name"]
        # Initialize your objects here by extending this class or adding attributes (if necessary)..  This should be done on initialization step of the object right now as it is a very basic implementation for visitor's purpose and you need to fill in details if needed.   Initializing with default values can prevent runtime errors when accessing these properties later during execution phase, e.g., self._signal_found = False or similar initializations are done here before anything else happens at all times (construction/creation)
``` 3). Visit method: This is where you perform the actual transformations on parsed Verilog code tree based upon your requirements as per xform framework design pattern mentioned above. In this part, use regex to replace text within nodes' content which are target declarations and visit children of those targets recursively (following similar logic like in visitor class).
```python 4) Main transformation function: This is the main point from where you start your code execution when calling it directly or via command line argument. It should accept input file, output files along with signal_name as arguments to perform transformations and return True/False for success / failure of operation respectively (This could be done using argparse).
```python 5) Command-Line Interface: Here you need a function which will parse the user inputs from command line. You can use `argparse` module's built in functionality or create custom one based on your requirements, e.g., define an option to provide input and output files as arguments at runtime (using add_argument() method).
```python 6) Docstrings: It would be great if you include docstring for each function/class that includes it's purpose / usage etc.. For example importing PyErr module from ast, re which is not necessary here but makes the code more readable.   Also make sure to add comments and inline documentation where needed (Use triple quotes around string literals).
```python 7) Error Handling: In order for your program's execution flow in case of error or invalid arguments provided as command line argument, you should implement proper handling using if-else block with appropriate message. For instance use PyErr exception when parsing source code and print out the traceback information to handle this kind of errors (Use sys module’s exit() function).
```python 8) Test Cases: You can create test cases for array as whole in inside operator, slice/part select tests using pytest. For constant or variable index scenarios you need functions that return specific values based on arguments passed while calling the transformation method from command line argument and check these results with expected outputs against your assumptions (For example use assert equal function to compare actual output of xform call versus an expectation).
```python 9) Comprehensive Documentation: Write comprehensive docstrings for all functions, classes in a way which makes it clear how they work as per their purpose and usage. Use Python's built-in help() or man pages (man command line utility used to display manual page of any python function/module).
```python 10) Integration with XForm Framework: Ensure that your code is integrated correctly into the existing xform framework patterns by following similar pattern as in visitor class. Follow all necessary steps mentioned above while writing and testing this part which include parsing, visiting elements based on certain signals etc.. Finally write tests for each requirement using pytest to ensure functionality works fine before deploying it further onto production codebase or system/software architecture if needed (For instance use assert equal function).
