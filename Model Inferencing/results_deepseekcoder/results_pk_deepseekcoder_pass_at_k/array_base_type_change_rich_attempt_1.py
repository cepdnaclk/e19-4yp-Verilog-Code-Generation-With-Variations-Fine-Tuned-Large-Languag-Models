Here's a Python module for your requirement using PyVerilog, argparse and re (for regex operations). It should be noted that you need to have pyverilog installed in order to use it here as well because we are going to parse the AST with this tool. 
```python
import sys
from typing import Optional
sys.path.insert(0, '/usr/local/libexec/pyverilog')   # add path where pyVerilog is installed at your system level if not in library paths already added
                                        
# Required modules for the task 
import argparse    
from ast import parse as a_parse   
from visitorPatternXFormBasedOnBaseTypeChange.ExampleVisitor import ExampleVisitor   # Your Visitor class's file name and its path, relative to this script or absolute one if provided here
                                          
# Required modules for the requirements 
import pyverilog as pv   
from re_moduleXFormBasedOnBaseTypeChange.replacementModule import replacementPattern   # your regex module with necessary transformations file name and its path, relative to this script or absolute one if provided here              
    
def transform(inputFile: str , outputfile :str = None) -> Optional[bool]: 
    '''Main function that carries out all the transformation'''     
   # PyVerilog parse AST from input file       
       with open (inputFile, 'r') as fp:         var_ast=a_parse(fp.read(), mode = "parse")    
             pv.init()    # Initialize pyverilog's environment 
          result=  pv.analyze('/'.join([str(e) for e in var_ast]))   # Analyzing the AST and getting its semantic information     
           if not isinstance (result, dict):             return False     print ('PyVerilog analysis failed')        sys.exit ()    def visitNode (*args ) :       ExampleVisitor().visit( * args)  var_ast . acceptNodes= visitorPatternXFormBasedOnBaseTypeChangeExample's
```Python code for xform module (xformModule):  ``    `      if __name__ == '__main__':    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()         # Setting up command-line arguments        parser.add_argument ('inputFile', type=str, help  = "Input File")         
           ```parser . add argument('outputfile' ,type  =  str  )    `      args =  vars(paraser. parse _args)    if not all ( arg in Args for Arg in [' input file']):         print("Missing arguments"') sys,exit()        transform_result = transfor
```Python code: ```mallin.../transforms-basedOnBaseTypeChange':  # Your transformation function's name and its path if not the same as before or you have defined a different way to implement this. Here is an example of how it could be done for your requirement 'bit_to_logic',
```python     def bit_to_logic(inputFile: str, outputfile : Optional[str] = None) -> bool:  '''Transform the base type from "Bit" in verilog to logic.'''    # Your regex transformations here        return transformResult   Here is how you could call your function for a specific input file (change it according
```python     bit_to_logic(inputFile='/path/yourfile', outputfile = '/outputFileName')  if __name__ == '__main': main()`      Your functions must be defined before this line or they can't run. It will also stop the execution of your script in case any function is not properly implemented and called from an appropriate place (like at command-line entry point).
```python     def bit_to_logic(inputFile: str, outputfile : Optional[str] = None) -> bool:'  # Your implementation here. The return type should be boolean based on the success of your transformation operations.'   Here is an example for this function if you wish to proceed with it and see how other functions work together in a program
