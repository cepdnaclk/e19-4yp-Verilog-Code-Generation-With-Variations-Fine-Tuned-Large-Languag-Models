Here's a simplified version of how you might approach this in Python using PyVerilog and argparse for CLI interaction, but keep note that it requires more work than necessary to complete your requirements perfectly due to its limitations (e.g., regex only supports basic pattern matching). 

```python
import pyverilog as pv
from ast import parse, NodeVisitor
import re
import argparse

def convert_signal(node):
    """Visit signal declarations and perform transformations"""  
     # Implement your visitor here using a subclass of AstNodeVisitor 
      pass      
       
# Define command line options with the parser. Here, you could add more flags for specific type conversions like packed/unpacked structs or hybrid types etc..         
parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Convert signals to different structure')  
parser.add_argument('--file', required=True)  # Add your CLI argument here       
args, remainder  = parser.parse_known_args()   
    
def main():     
       with open (str(remainder), 'r' ) as file:          content = str(content))  
           ast =  parse ('\n'.join([line for line in  files])))        # Parse the Python source code into an abstract syntax tree.    
           
    visitor= convert_signal()      visit (ast)         print ("Success" if successful else "Failure")      
if __name__ == 'main':          main ()  ```                   
Here, I have assumed a simple structure where signals are declared in the same file as their corresponding variable declarations and it uses PyVerilog's AST to parse Python code into an abstract syntax tree. This is then used by your visitor pattern for signal conversion task.  The output of this process will be printed on console, if successful or failure respectively indicating whether all signals were successfully converted in the given python file/module.
