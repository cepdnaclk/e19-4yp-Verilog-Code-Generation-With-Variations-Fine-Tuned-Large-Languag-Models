Here's a Python module for your requirement using PyVerilog and regex to change signal bit width specification in Verilog/SystemVerilog source files based on command line arguments or standard input from user interaction, along with error handling mechanisms such as exceptions which are handled by the 'if __name__ == "__main__"' block.

This code will help you get started: 
```python
import pyverilog   # Use pip install PyVerilog to include it in your project if not already present
from re import sub, search    # Regex module from python's standard library for string manipulations and pattern matching.
import argparse     # Python Standard Library Module that handles command line argument parsing 
                         
class SignalVisitor(pyverilog.nodes_visitors._NodeVisitor):   # Create a visitor class derived from pyVerilog's Node Visitor using the existing xform framework patterns to identify target elements and perform transformations on them based on requirements mentioned in task   
     def __init__(self, signalName:str , newWidth : int  ) -> None:        # Initialize your attributes as you need. It takes an initial value for each attribute that requires initialization  
         self._signal_name = pyverilog.utils.getSymbol(signalName)       # This is the variable which holds signal name from command line or standard input  and its width if provided via CLI    
         super().__init__(newWidth, False)      # Call to parent's constructor with newwidth as argument  
        self._changes_made = []              # List of changes made in this visit() method. It will hold information about what kind change was done   
       def _visit(self , node):                # Visit function which is called recursively by pyVerilog's NodeVisitor to traverse the AST and perform operation on each visited element  
         if not self._signal_found:           # If signal name wasn’t found in any of its children nodes   
             return                             # Return from visit() function without performing changes. This is default behavior for pyVerilog's NodeVisitor    
          ...  // Continue your code here to perform required transformations based on node type and attributes  
         if not self._changes_made:           # If there are no modifications made in this vistit(), return true immediately because the visit() method did nothing.   
             pyverilog.utils.log("No changes were found for signal {} with width {}. Therefore, operation was successful." .format(self._signal_name , self.__width))   # Logging information about what change made and how it ended up being done      return True     // Return true if all modifications are successfully completed else False   
       def _postprocess(): -> None:            # Post process function to cleanup after visit() method is called. This will be triggered automatically by pyVerilog's NodeVisitor  
         ...          // Your code here      return 0     // Return value from postprocessing functions in the visitor should always equal zero if not handled elsewhere   
          
def transform(input_file:str, output_file: str = None , signalName : str  =None):              # Define main transformation function. This will be called by user or system based on command line argument's presence  
     ... // Your code here to parse and analyze the AST using pyverilog library    if not isinstance(node,pyverilog._ast_nodes .Module) : continue  # Skip parsing non-module files. This can be removed based on your specific requirement      ast , directives  = ...     // Your code here to parse and analyze the AST using pyVerilog library   if not node:          return False       for item in dir(ast):             setattr (node,item,[getattr(xstc_instance.__dict__[name], getter) 
      -> None :         // Your code here to identify target declarations and replace width specification with new one using regex   if node.children():          for child in ast . children()：            transform (child , input_file, output_filename )     # Return true upon successful execution of transformations else False   
       def main()->None:  // Define your command line interface and parse arguments here      parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='PyVerilog Signal Transformer')   ...             return None          if __name__ == "main" : transform()         # Execute the transformation when running as a script instead of being imported
