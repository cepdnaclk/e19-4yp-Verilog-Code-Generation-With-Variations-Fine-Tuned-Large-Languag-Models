Here is a Python module for your requirement using PyVerilog, re (for regular expressions), argparse and unittest(python's testing tool). This script will not be able to run directly as it does not contain complete code but can serve you with the overall design of how this could work. 

```Python
import pyverilog   # PyVerilog is a python interface for verilog and System Verilog parsers, like VERILOG-SYNTAX Parser in C++ version or Python's Lexer/Parser combinators library by ANTLR. 
from re import sub    as re_sub     # For text replacement using regex pattern matching with substitution operator 're'. Substitute function will replace matched strings according to a specified patter and replaces them in the given string or list of characters at each occurrence based on your requirement, if you want. 
import argparse   # To handle command line arguments for input file name / path etc . ArgumentParser is used here because it provides convenient methods that help user generate usage messages easily which can be helpful to developers while writing code in the team or individual developer's IDE/text editor. It also has various other useful properties and functions like this one are available, so you could use them according your requirement for command line arguments handling as well etc .
import unittest   # Python provides a module called 'unittest', which can be used to write small test cases while writing code in python language. This will help us check our function's correctness without running the whole program at once, thus simplifying and making it easy for developers testing their codes as well .
import os   # Python standard library module that helps with file manipulation operations like reading a file or creating/writing to files etc.. 
from inspect import currentframe    # To get information about currently executing function. This is useful in maintaining the context of where our transformation methods are being called from, and then we can use this call frame's 'locals()'. That way if an error occurs during execution at any point within a method here (visit(), transform_example()), it will return to that location for debugging.
from pyverilog import ast as PyVerilogAST   # As the name suggests, we use this module from Python's standard library package named 'pyverilog', which provides AST-based representation of Verilog code and can be parsed by our visitor later on in a much easier way.
from YourNodeClass import Node  as SignalDeclaration    # Assuming that your node is an instance class (subclass) from another python file named 'YourNodeClass' with attribute names like "name" etc, to identify signal declarations and perform actions based upon them . This should be replaced by the actual name of YourPythonFileWithDeclarativeNodes which has classes as subclasses.
from pyverilog import print_ast   # PyVerilog provides a way for printing ASTs in their raw form, so we can debug our visitor and it would work well here too . 
import sys    # Python's module that is used to access system-specific parameters like the version of python itself. This could be useful if you want your program/module to print out its own details when called as a main function in command line interface or other ways.. Itâ€™ll give more information about how it was run, and what arguments were passed into that script etc .
    
class ExampleVisitor(YourNodeClass.Decl):   # This should be replaced by your actual node class where the signal is declared (should inherit from Node). For example: 'from YourPythonFileWithNodes import Decl' if you have a custom sub-node in python file named "YourPythonFileWithNods".
     def __init__(self, signal_name):    # Replace with actual node name.  If your nodes are not of the same type (e.g., 'Node', or even more complex), replace this part too if necessary . This will be called once when creating a visitor instance and sets up initial state for our function
         YourNodeClass.__init__(self)   # Calling parent's constructor here, to ensure it gets invoked properly (if any).  If your class does not have an init method then you can delete this line. Otherwise if there is more initialization required than just calling super().__init__() .
         self._changes_made = []    # This should be replaced by actual attribute name which will store changes made during the visit process, e.g., 'self.'SignalName's', or some other variable in your code if necessary..  You may also need to adjust this part depending on how you want and where/how you are planning storing these data as well .
         self._signal_found = False   # This should be replaced by actual attribute name, e.g., 'self.'SignalFound', or some other variable in your code if necessary..  Again the way to store this is upto how and where/how you want it stored too , ie when making changes (if any), what happens will depend on implementation of visitor class itself .
         self._signal_name = signal_name   # This should be replaced by actual attribute name, e.g., 'self.'SignalName', or some other variable in your code if necessary..  Again depends upon how you want and where/how to store this data too , ie when making changes (if any), what happens will depend on implementation of visitor class itself .
         
     def visit(self, node):   # This should be replaced by actual method name. Invisits each Verilog AST using the appropriate methods based upon its type and content to make modifications if necessary then calls parent's ```visit``` with same arguments (e.g., for children)
         YourNodeClass._YourMethod.__call__(self, node=node )   # Calling a method on your current class or object which does the actual job of visiting each nodes and performing appropriate actions based upon its type . If necessary replace '__' by '' if you are using self in python.  Again depends how much work is done with this visitor function to be implemented according as per requirement, ie what kind/type modifications should it perform on verilog ASTs etc..
     def changes_made(self):   # This method will return a list of all the items that were modified during visit. If no item was changed (i.e., if signal not found), then this function returns an empty array, otherwise with names/signals in it .  Invisits each Verilog AST using these methods to get what is required and store them as per requirement when calling the script or module that will use your visitor for further operations on verilog codes.
     def signal_found(self):   # This method returns whether a target element was found during visit process, ie if it identified any declarations with specific name .  If not called yet this function would return false after being invoked by some child nodes or similar methods of visitor instance to mark the fact that something is indeed done.
     def signal_name(self):   # This method returns what kind/type element was found during visit process, ie if it identified any declarations with specific name .  If not called yet this function would return None after being invoked by some child nodes or similar methods of visitor instance to mark the fact that something is indeed done.
     def transform_example(self):   # This method will be responsible for parsing, visiting and performing transformations according as per requirement given in your requirements .  It should take input file name / path etc., signal names which needs transformation , output location (file), return True/False on success or failure of the operation.
```     
This is a rough sketch because it would be quite long for such an extensive task, but I hope this helps you get started with your project! You'll need to fill in details about how and when data should change according to requirements as well so that we can fully test our code properly before running the whole program.
