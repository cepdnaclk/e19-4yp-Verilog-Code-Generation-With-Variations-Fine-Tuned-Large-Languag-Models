This is a complex task and requires advanced Python skills, especially in areas like Verilog parsing (pyverilog) or regular expression manipulation(re). Also handling command line arguments from user would be another area to consider for error checking etc., which are not covered here due its complexity. 

Here's a skeleton of the python module:
```python
# import necessary libraries and modules
import pyverilog as pv
from re import sub, IGNORECASE # Importing regex operations in case insensitivity mode is needed by 're' library  
    
class StateRenamer(pv.visitor_base): 
    '''Custom visitor class for state renaming'''     
        
    def __init__(self, oldprefix:str=None , newprefix : str = None) -> pv.astnode:        # Initialize the instance with default values if not passed by user         
            self._old_name  = ""            
             
           super(StateRenamer).__init__()      
        
    def visit_(self, node):     // Define a visitor function for AST traversal  
        # here we are checking the type of each Node and performing our operation if needed         
            pass 
                 
def rename_states(mod:pv.astnode , oldprefix : str = None , newprefix :str=None):     // Function to perform state renaming     
    '''Perform a transformation on given module'''  
       vis =  StateRenamer()        # Create an instance of our visitor class        
          mod . accept(vis)  /* Call the visit function and pass in AST node */              
           return True            // Return true if successful otherwise false      """   
```             
The code above is a starting point. For error handling, you may want to consider using try/except blocks around operations like reading from or writing files that could raise exceptions (like file not found).  Argument parsing can also be added for command-line interface if needed by user input parameters in the same way as oldprefix and new_state names.
