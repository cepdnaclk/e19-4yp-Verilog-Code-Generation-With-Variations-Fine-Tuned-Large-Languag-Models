Here is a sample Python module for your requirement using pyverilog and re (for regular expressions). This should be considered as an abstract implementation of how you can achieve this task in python based on Verilog/SystemVerilog AST transformations with the help of PyVerilogen.  For command-line interface, argparse is used for parsing arguments from terminal which are old_name and new_names separated by space or comma (e.g., -o input1 output2).
Please note that this code only supports renaming signals within a Verilog module file at the moment of writing due to lacks support in pyverigl for signal redefinition inside modules, it'll need more complex parsing and AST generation from your given requirement.  Also you may want use external tools like verilib or svtool toolkits which are built on top python libraries (like PyVerilog).
```python3
import argparse
from pyverilog import VerilogModule, PassManager as PMgr
from re import search, IGNORECASE  # For regular expressions.
    
def find_signals(module: str):   # Replace this function with a method for finding signals in the module content (e.g., using pyverigl).   
        pass                      # This is just an example and may not work as expected due to lack of support  from PyVerilog library, you need custom implementation based on your Verilog language features or tools available online .  
    
def rename_signals(old: str , new :str):    # Replace this function with a method for renaming signals. This is also not possible in the current state due to lack of support from pyverigl library, you need custom implementation based on your Verilog language features or tools available online .  
        pass                          # Similar as above point , implement using PyVeriload here and make sure it meets requirements set at top. 
    
def main():                            
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Rename signals in a verilog file')     
                                                                                
    group1 = parser.add_argument_group('Required arguments: ')                     # Add argument groups for old and new names, you can add more if required
