Here's a basic example of how you could structure your Python module to meet these requirements using PyVerilog for parsing and visiting tree nodes, re (for regular expressions), argparse (to handle command line arguments) etc.: 

```python
import pyverilog as pv
from abc import ABCMeta, abstractmethod   # Abstract Base Class in Python3.4+ required to define the methods that should be implemented by a visitor class and xform module

class XForm(metaclass=ABCMeta):  # Defining an abstract base class for transformation modules which will contain some common functions like visit_array, etc., also containing pyverilog AST parsing code. The ABCMeta is used to ensure all the methods in a visitor are implemented by subclasses
    @abstractmethod   def accept(self):  # Each concrete xform should implement this method which would call respective transformation function based on type of signal passed inside visit_array/visit_{type} functions or any other specific operations required. This is an abstract base class for the visitor pattern to follow where each child subclass implements a unique operation
    @abstractmethod   def getType(self):  # Each concrete xform should implement this method which returns type of signal it handles, so that parent transformer can use these details while performing transformation on signals. This is an abstract base class for the visitor pattern to follow where each child subclass has its unique role
    @abstractmethod   def visit_array(self):  # Each concrete xform should implement this method which would accept array as a parameter and perform appropriate transformations based upon type of signal passed inside methods. This is an abstract base class for the visitor pattern to follow where each child subclass implements specific operation on arrays
    @abstractmethod   def visit_signal(self):  # Each concrete xform should implement this method which would accept signals as a parameter and perform appropriate transformations based upon type of signal passed inside methods. This is an abstract base class for the visitor pattern to follow where each child subclass implements specific operation on array elements
    @abstractmethod   def visit_module(self):  # Each concrete xform should implement this method which would accept module as a parameter and perform appropriate transformations based upon type of signal passed inside methods. This is an abstract base class for the visitor pattern to follow where each child subclass implements specific operation on array elements
    @abstractmethod   def get_key(self):  # Each concrete xform should implement this method which would return key if any, else it returns none (or throws error) based upon type of signal passed inside methods. This is an abstract base class for the visitor pattern to follow where each child subclass implements specific operation on array elements
    @abstractmethod   def set_key(self):  # Each concrete xform should implement this method which would accept key as a parameter and perform appropriate transformations based upon type of signal passed inside methods. This is an abstract base class for the visitor pattern to follow where each child subclass implements specific operation on array elements
    @abstractmethod   def transform(self):  # Each concrete xform should implement this method which would return True/False after performing transformation operations and updating any necessary state, else it returns False. This is an abstract base class for the visitor pattern to follow where each child subclass implements specific operation on array elements
    @abstractmethod   def get_key(self):  # Each concrete xform should implement this method which would return key if any (or throws error) based upon type of signal passed inside methods.

```    
In a nutshell: You're writing transformations that take arrays as input (which could be multi-dimensional), convert them into associative structures and return either True or False after performing necessary operations. This can include various types of signals, such as ints/enums representing keys in the multidimensional array etc., which you would need to implement according their specific requirements for this transformation module (string key type handling).
