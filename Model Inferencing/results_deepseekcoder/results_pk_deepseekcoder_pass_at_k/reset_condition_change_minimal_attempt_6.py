Here's a skeleton of how you might go about implementing this task in Python using PyVerilog for parsing and analysis, an argparse module to handle command-line arguments, etc.:

```python 
import pyverilog as pv
from verilog import ast_pb2   # You may need a different library depending on your Verilog syntax. This is just the one I've used for this example code block and might not be suitable in other contexts, you should replace with appropriate libs based on input file type 
import re   
from argparse import ArgumentParser    
  
class MyXform(pv.ast_pb2._FileBase):      # You need to extend ast_pb from pyverilog and create a custom class that inherits it, name as per your requirement ie., FileTransformer  or whatever you have named for the transformation module   
   pass    
  
class MyXformVisitor(pv.ast_pb2._FileBase):      # Create another visitor based on ast pattern inherited from pb file base class to process logic as per your requirement ie., XFormLogicProcessor  or whatever you have named for the Visitor module   
       pass    
  
def parse():         # Parse function using pyverilog parser, replace this with appropriate parsing library based on input type. You should add proper error handling here as well in case of invalid file etc., otherwise return False/Error 
      try:         
           pv_ast = MyXform().Parse(args['file'])   # Replace these placeholders according to your needs   
      except Exception as e :         // Add exception handler     raise       pass                  
        ...                   
def main():            
            parser=ArgumentParser() 
               ......                  .....           .          return parse_and_transform(args.file)   # Replace these placeholders according to your needs    def xformLogicProcessor (pv_ast):       // Use visitor pattern here, replace this with appropriate logic processor based on requirement ie., XFormLogicVisitor 
            ...                      return MyXform().Process(pv_file)   # Replace these placeholders according to your needs    def parseAndTransform:         parser.add_argument('--input', '-i')       args=parser .parse ..... (put the logic in this function as per requirement ie., changeResetCondition or whatever you have named for main driver module 
```   // Include all necessary imports and docstrings according to your needs    def parse():        pass     # Add error handling, validation etc. here if any such requirements are present (pass)      return True/False based on success of failure in parsing file or not(Add exception handler for it as per requirement ie., handle errors properly when required).  
```python  // Include all necessary imports and docstrings according to your needs    def main():          pass     # Add error handling, validation etc. here if any such requirements are present (pass)      return True/False based on success of failure in parsing file or not(Add exception handler for it as per requirement ie., handle errors properly when required). 
```python   // Include all necessary imports and docstrings according to your needs    parser.add_argument('--input', '-i')       args=parser .parse()     return xformLogicProcessor (pv_.ast)      if __name__ == 'main':          main(args.)
```  This is a simplified skeleton, you might need more comprehensive code according to your specific requirements and use case. Also note that this example doesn't cover all cases as it depends heavily on the Verilog/SystemVerilog syntax used in input files which may vary between languages (e.g., SystemVerilog uses 1c style comments, while verilog does not).
