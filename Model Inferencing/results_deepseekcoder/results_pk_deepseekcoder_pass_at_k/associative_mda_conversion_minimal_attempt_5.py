Sure, I can provide a basic skeleton of how you might structure your Python module to accomplish this task using pyverilog for parsing and AST manipulation. However please note that it's quite complex since there are many details not covered in the requirements such as handling multiple associative dimensions etc., so some parts may need more sophisticated design or additional features like exception catching, logging management among others which can be added according to your needs:
```python
# Import necessary modules and packages here. 
import pyverilog       # This is for parsing Verilog code into an AST tree structure using a library called PyVerilog (https://pyverilog.readthedocs.io/en/)    
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod   # Abstract base class module to handle common functionality in visitor classes 
import re    # Regular expression support for text matching and manipulation with strings or other data types using a regular expressions (https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html)    
from argparse import ArgumentParser   # Command-line argument parsing module to handle command line inputs 
import sys    # System specific functionality such as accessing the exit status of processes, handling I/O redirects etc (https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html)    

# Define a visitor class that inherits from ABC and implements an abstract method for each transform operation 
class ArrayToAssocArrayVisitor(ABC):   # Use Abstract Base Class to define the interface of our visitors (https://docs.python.org/3/library/abc.html)    
    @abstractmethod                   # Decorator that declares a abstract method for each transform operation 
    def visit_array_declaration(self, node):   # Node here represents an AST tree structure generated by PyVerilog (https://pyverilog.readthedocs.io/en/)    
        pass                           # Implement the behavior of this abstract method in each subclass 
    @abstractmethod                   # Decorator that declares a abstract method for error handling  
    def visit_other(self, node):      # Same as above but handles other types not covered by specific visitors like strings and ints etc.    
        pass                           # Implement the behavior of this abstract methods in each subclass 

# Define transformation functions using visitor pattern here (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern)   
def convert(input, output):   # Function to perform transformations on input Verilog code and write it out into an output file    
    ast = pyverilog.parse(input)  # Parse the given source AST tree structure using PyVerilog's parse function (https://pyverilog.readthedocs.io/en/)  
                    # Create a visitor instance and call each transform operation on this parsed input   
                vis = ArrayToAssocArrayVisitor()  # Initialize the Visitor here    
        for child in ast:                     # For every node (in our case, an AST tree) we do something with it using visit methods  
            if isinstance(child):             # Check whether this object corresponds to a Verilog array declaration or not    ….      vis.visit_array_declaration(node= child ) ...     elif...         else:              vis . visit_other ( node = Child)        // Handle all other types of nodes in the AST tree here  
                continue                       # Continue with next operation for this type or proceed to error handling    pass …..# End if block and call appropriate visitor methods after visiting each child     return True          # Return true on success, false otherwise (https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html)
```   This is a very simplified version of the above requirement implementation that you can further expand to suit your requirements as per details mentioned in it: handling more types and exception management among others along with proper command line interface design, docstrings etc., will be needed according to use case scenario at hand like for instance parsing all Verilog code into an AST tree structure using PyVerilog's parse function.
