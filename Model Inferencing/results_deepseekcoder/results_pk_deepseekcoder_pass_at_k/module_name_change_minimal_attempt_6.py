Here's a simplified version of how you might implement such functionality using PyVerilog and argparse for CLI, regex to find module names in comments or identifiers that should be replaced due to naming conventions changes etc.: 
Please note this is just an example on the structure. You need further adjustments according your needs:
```python
import pyverilog as pv
from verilog import ast, nodes_abc
# from xformframework here or wherever you're implementing transforming modules for a framework like XFormFramework 
    
def findModuleName(file):    # Assuming this function is responsible to read the file and get content of it. It may need modification as per your requirement  
        with open (filename, 'r') as f:     
            data = f.read()                 
          return pyverilog_parseASTfromString(data)  # Assuming this function is responsible for parsing the verilog code to AST    
        
def replaceModuleNameInCommentOrIdentifier():   # This should be a method in visitor class that will visit all nodes and find module name references. It may need modification as per your requirement   
        pass  // Implement this function based on requirements here     
      
class ModuleRenameVisitor(ast.NodeTransformer):    
            def __init__(self, old_name: str, new_name:str) -> None:   # Constructor to store the names that need replacement   
                self._old = pyverilog_RegExpCompileToRegexpPattern("^"+pyverilog_quoteIdent(ast.unescapeIdentifier('%s' % old_name)))  , new name can be replaced with 'new module', here we are using '%n')
                self._replace = pyverilog_RegExpCompileToRegexpPattern("^"+pyverilog_quoteIdent(ast.unescapeIdentifier('%s' % old_name)))  , new name can be replaced with 'new module', here we are using '%n')
            
            def visitModuleDecl(self, node: nodes) -> ast.Node:    # Visit function to replace the names in comment and identifiers  
                if (not isinstance('module' == self._old)) or ('^`sxport module name="%name_arg";\n  '+isInstance(node, id))) {     // Add more conditions here as per requirement    } else{        return super().visitModuleDecl()}
                # Replace the text in comment and identifiers with new names. Here replace function is used to do it but you can use other functions also for replacing like str_replace(self._old, self._new)   here we are using '%n')    }  return node;}}' % old name
            
            # Add more visitXXX methods according your requirements (like add/remove ports in a module etc.)        
```    
For command-line interface you can use argparse:
 ```python       
def parse_args():   // Parse the arguments from CLI. It should be modified as per requirement   
  parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()     
  # Add all necessary parameters here for your task, like file name or module to rename etc         
     return args      
```       
You can use docstrings in Python with python's `__doc__` attribute (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) :   // Add all necessary details here for your task   
Finally, you need to integrate this functionality into the existing xform framework:  It will require that a new class or module in our codebase is created which has methods like `transform(file)` (This should be called from main function), where we can call appropriate transformations and pass necessary parameters. If any error occurs during these operations, then return False otherwise True as per requirement  
    // Add all the details here for your task     
```python    
def run_xform():  # This is responsible to interact with xForm framework (like calling methods of existing classes/modules) based on passed parameters. It should be modified according requirements in a way that suits this function         
   args = parseArgs()    // Parse the arguments from CLI, you can call above `parse_args` method here      if not isinstance(ast.literalEval('__name__ == "main"'), bool):  return False     else:       ModuleRenameVisitor().transform('/path/to/yourfile', 'newmodule')    // Use the visitor to transform file, you can call above `ModuleRenamingvisitor` and pass necessary parameters here      if not isinstance(ast.literalEval('__name__ == "main"'), bool):  return False     else:       True
```   Finally make sure all imports are correct (like 'pyverilog', etc.) according to your requirement    // Include appropriate error handling and validation as per requirements      } ```python}'''})}}}}}')` in python. This is the end of code for this module, you can add more details here if required
