To implement this task, you would need to follow these steps in Python using PyVerilog's `Pyverilogen` and regular expressions (regex) library for text transformations : 
- Use pyverigen package from veripyc/pyperl or similar packages which can parse Verilog source code. This will be the main tool to process AST of a given file using PyVerilogrammar, an abstract syntax tree parser generator in Python that builds parsers for programming languages based on context-free grammars (CFG).
  ```python
  from pyverigen import parse_file as pf    #parse verilog source code.
  ```
 - Use regular expressions to perform the actual text transformations: identify signals in declarations, assignments and references of a Verilog module using `re` package for matching whole words only (not partial).  This will be done on each parsed AST node by traversing it recursively with visitor pattern. Each time we find signal name then replace its occurrences as per the requirement in xform function
- For error handling, you can use Python's builtin exceptions or create custom exception classes that extend them for specific errors raised during execution of your code such as `VerilogParseError` etc., and catch these within visitor functions.  This will ensure robustness against different kinds inputs to the program (e.g corrupted files, wrong file formats)
- Finally return True/False based on whether any changes were made or not in successful execution of transformation function: If at least one signal name was found then we have updated a module and thus returning False otherwise it means no modifications required so true is returned but if there are errors during the process (like parsing files, finding signals etc.), they will be caught by exception handling.
  ```python
  def xform(old_name: str , new_name:str):     #xformation function to rename signal in verilog module codebase using visitor pattern and regex for matching word only (whole name).        return True/False;       if error occur then raise exception.    try…except
  ``` 
The complete Python script with proper imports, a Visitor class that extends the xform base from existing patterns in `xforms` module will look like below:
- Import all necessary libraries at top of your python file (i.e., pyverigen , re and argparse). This is needed so as to use PyVerilog's functions, regex operations etc within our codebase itself which can be easily integrated with the existing xform framework patterns by following these steps:
  ```python 
# Importing necessary libraries at top of your python file.    from pyverigen import parse_file #parse verilog source code .      re       ...argpars...     pf,....try…except..catch.....if error occur then raise exception ....else return True/False;   if there are errors during the process (like parsing files or finding signals etc.), they will be caught by excption handling.
```  A main function in your python file that would call above functions based on user inputs:   `def run():      parse = pf(file_path)     result=visitor().xform(signal,new_name).if there is error then print('Error...') elif not...... else ....else
```  A command-line interface can be created using argparse.Python's builtin `argparse` module would allow you to pass the file path and signal name as arguments from your terminal:    def run():      parser = ..... #create an ArgumentParser object that will handle our program’s argument..  
```  Finally, a docstring at top of each function can be used for readability. For instance : `def xform(self , old_name: str , new_name:str) -> bool`` This is the visitor pattern in action and it identifies target elements within an AST using PyVerilogrammar, a Python tool that builds parsers based on context-free grammars (CFG). If all done correctly then this function will replace signals with `new_name`.
