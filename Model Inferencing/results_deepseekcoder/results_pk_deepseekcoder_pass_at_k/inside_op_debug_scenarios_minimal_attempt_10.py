Here is a basic example of how you could approach this task using Python and PyVerilog, but it's important to note that Verilog/SystemVerilog syntax isn't very straightforward due to its wide range of features (like multiple loops over arrays) which are not covered by the existing xform framework patterns. This is why a proper AST parser like pyverilog would be necessary for this task, and I will use it in my code as an example:

```python
import argparse
from ast import NodeVisitor, parse  # Importing built-in nodes of the Python's ast module.
from re import match    # For using regex pattern matching operation on string values.
# Assuming we have a file named 'ast_visit', containing pyverilog code as strings to be parsed and analyzed by visitor class: 
import sys   , os, glob;sys.path.append(os.path.join('..','lib')) ; import ast_visitor # Your AST Visiting module   
# The PyVerilog parser is a part of the 'pyverilog' package (you need to install it) – you can use pip command if not installed yet: `pip3 install pyverilog`  
import pyverilog as pv     # Importing Python Verilog Parser. This will be used for parsing and analysis of ASTs in our code;   
# The 'ast' module is a built-in part with python, so we won’t need to import it explicitly here – the parser function (pyverilog) provides us all necessary tools:   pd.parse(code_string), NodeVisitor for visiting nodes in tree structures etc;   
# In real scenario you should use pyverilog's own visitor classes and AST node types if available, but I assume above example is a starting point – it will be expanded as per the requirement   ; pd.parse(code_string).body[0].name == 'main'; ast module provides all necessary tools for parsing;
# The code of transformation function:    def transform (self): pass # Here you can put your transformations logic, similar to existing xform framework patterns – return appropriate value accordingly   ;     ^--> Your answer should be provided here.     Note that the 'transform' method must use PyVerilog’s visitor pattern and AST manipulation capabilities in order for it not only pass through nodes (similar as your visiting function) but also perform actual transformations on them using pyverilog parser functionality
# Command line parsing:    def parse_args(): # Here you can provide a command-line interface with argparse module;   sys.argv is list of arguments passed to the script, it’s useful for getting info from users or setting up scripts like this one – return parsed result as an object which we call 'params'
# The main function:    def __main__(): # This line will run when python file directly executed;   Here you can put code that should be called in the end of your script, similar to existing xform framework patterns.     For example :  if _name_ == '_main_': ... Your answer for transform method call (and/or main function) would go here
# Documentation:    """ This is a docstring which will appear when you use help(yourmodule), or print statements etc., to give an overview of your module’s purpose and how it works – make sure all the functions are well documented with appropriate comments, including any parameters they accept;   Also include information about each function's return value (whether that be a boolean indicating whether something has changed/not);
# The code provided here is just an example to give you idea of what kind of task could potentially get done. It will require significant expansion and modification based on the actual requirements, as well as adding more features or functions in order for it fully satisfy your needs – but hopefully this gives a starting point that can be expanded upon further!
```  
This is just an outline to guide you through how one might approach such task. The full implementation of each requirement would require much more detailed and complex code, as well as thorough testing with various inputs (both valid Verilog/SystemVerilog programs), which will not fit in the scope here due its length limit – but I hope this gives a good starting point to work from!
