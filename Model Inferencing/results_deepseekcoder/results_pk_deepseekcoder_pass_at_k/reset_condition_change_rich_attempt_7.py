In order to implement this change, we will need a couple of additional classes and methods in our visitor class for Python Verilog parsing (pyverilog). We also have to add functionality into argparse command-line interface that handles all input parameters from the user through terminal/command line. Below is an example implementation:

```python
import pyverilog as pv  # PyVerilog parser and AST builder for Python3 (requires csmith)
from re import sub, IGNORECASE   # For regex transformations in python code using 're' module.
# argparse is a built-in module of the standard library which allows command line argument parsing – it makes useable from other programs or scripts within Python applications through functions and variables to handle user input as an interface for our application programmatically . It simplifies tasks like fetching information about options/arguments, usage help etc.
import argparse   # Provides a fast and easy way to write command line interfaces in python 3 using ArgumentParser class provided by the module 'argparse'. A good alternative can be built-in modules of Python itself such as optparse or getopt which are more powerful but less friendly for beginners.
import ast       # This is used when we want define and manipulate an abstract syntax tree (AST) in python, PyVerilog provides us with this feature through pv module – the parser/visitor to build ASTs from source code strings or files (.sv). The 'ast' library can be considered as a more low-level interface for working directly on nodes of an Abstract Syntax Tree.
# For error handling and validation, we use exceptions which are raised when certain conditions aren’t met in the program (like file not found etc.) — they allow us to handle errors gracefully within our code by using Python's exception mechanism . Also provides a way for calling functions or methods from other modules.
import sys        # This module is used as an interface between python calls on your operating system and also allows you write portable applications in different programming languages across platforms (Windows, Unix/Linux etc.). ‘sys’ contains commands to interact with the Python interpreter itself such at exiting or returning from a function.
# 'inspect' module is used for getting information about objects like classes & methods of python object and so on . It includes functionality in inspecting code (like getdoc, ...) as well ‘cmp’ can be replaced by our own compare functions to replace the default comparison method provided Python with an overridden one.
import ctypes    # This module allows you call C libraries from within your python script like calling a library or function in another language using 'ctypes'. It is used for inter-process communication between different applications and also provides some functionality that lets use interact directly/communicate data to the system (shared memory, file IPC).
# For creating command line argument parser. The argparse module creates clear, helpful error messages . ‘add_argument()’ function can be given a list of arguments in terminal or as input from users via CLI tool and it would handle all necessary details about where the user inputs their data by giving help if needed etc
parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='xform framework to change reset condition')  # Creating command line argument parser with description for better understanding of what will be done on terminal/CLI . The function 'add_argument()’ is a method that adds arguments in the form: optional flags, required positional and Nargs (for example '-u', '/path' or both).
# Add your CLI parameters here. ‘help=''…'', type... etc are for describing what kind of input will be provided by user to make it more intuitive . It can also have default value if you want a predefined parameter set as per the requirement and so on, which is very helpful in case any new/modified users need not change anything.
parser.add_argument('-i', '--inputfile', help='Input Verilog file path')  # CLI option for input . The function argument() helps to define what type of arguments will be expected and also how the user should provide it which is very useful in case anyone needs a more friendly way.
parser.add_argument('-o', '--outputfile', help='Output Verilog file path')  # CLI option for output . This time function argument() handles all necessary details about what kind of input will be expected, and also how the user should provide it which is very useful in case anyone needs a more friendly way.
parser.add_argument('-s', '--signalname', help='Signal name to change')  # CLI option for signal . The function argument() handles all necessary details about what kind of input will be expected, and also how the user should provide it which is very useful in case anyone needs a more friendly way.
args = parser.parse_args(sys.argv[1:])   # Parsing arguments from CLI/Terminal . parse_args() function parses command line options into variables so that they can be used by the program as required – it’s handy to have a clean and simple way for user inputs (like in our case -i, --inputfile etc).
# Now we are ready with arguments , use them according your requirement. For example: input_file = args.inputFile . In this line of code you should replace these placeholders accordingly based on what exactly the requirements want from users to provide through CLI/Terminal or in source file itself (if any).
```  # End-of Importing Section, Starts From Here with Code Sections for Transformation Module and Command Line Interface. The above sections are part of our application's core functionality which includes handling input arguments like signal names from the user through CLI/Terminal or in a source file itself as per requirements .
