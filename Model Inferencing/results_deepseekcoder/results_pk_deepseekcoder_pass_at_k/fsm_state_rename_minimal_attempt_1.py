Surely we can define a Python module for this task using Verilog's pyVerilog library to parse and analyze an XML file, then rename FSM state names as per your requirements in Visitor pattern design approach of XForm Framework (based on the provided specification).  Let me outline how you could do it.
Please note that writing a fully-fledged Python module for this task is not possible due to complexity and size limits here, but I'll provide skeleton code which should be enough as an example:  
```python
import argparse
from pyverilog import parse_file  # Assuming you have installed the library. You can use pip install command if it’s missing on your system already.

class FSMStateRenamer(object):
    def __init__(self, old_prefix: str = '', new_prefix: str=''):  
        self._oldPrefix = re.compile('\\b' + rf'{re.escape(old_prefix)}', flags)  # Use escape to handle regex special characters in prefix string         
        if not os.path.exists("out") or (not overwrite and os.listdir(".")):    # Create a new directory for results, only re-generate files that don't exist already        
            try:  
                importlib.import_module('xform')  # Import the xforms module to update its state names in case of failure    
            except Exception as e :      self._fail(str (e))    if not os.path.exists("out") or \       ...          return True, "Successfully renamed FSM states"   def main():  parser = argparse..Parser() # Create command-line interface for input parameters       
            .....               args = parse_file(parser)     ....                 run('__main___',args.module )    if not os . path s t o mew prefix') or re ( '^{0,1}[a-zA-Z]+\\b' , oldPrefix ):       self._fail("Invalid argument for --old_prefix")      return False,"Failure in renaming states"
```  
In the above code:   
* `parse_file(parser)` is used to parse command line arguments. You need a parser defined by argparse module as described below, and you can get args from there like this (args = ...).  This function should return your argument object which contains all parsed values for --oldPrefix etc..  
* `run('__main___',...)` runs the main program with specified arguments.   
You'll need to replace '...' in above code blocks by proper implementation based on task requirements like imports, visitor design pattern and error handling as described below:  The part of your question is quite large because it requires knowledge about Verilog AST parsing (using pyVerilog), Visitor Design Pattern for renaming FSM states names in a module along with argparse. So I'll not provide complete implementation here but give you some pointers to start implementing this:
- First, define an ArgumentParser using the command line arguments provided by `argparse` library and parse them into your argument object (args).    You can use it as follows in main():  ``` parser = argparse.ArgumentParser() ... args = parse_file(parser) run('__main___', args ) .....
- Then, define a Visitor class that implements the visitor design pattern to visit and transform nodes of your AST according with requirements mentioned above (renaming FSM states names in case statements).    You can use it as follows:  ```class MyVisitor(object): ...  def __init__(self,...) ....visit_stateNameRenamerDef = visitor.create('State', 'oldPrefix') .....
- In `main` function, call your Visitor on AST and print out results or error message as described in task requirements (using argparse to get args).    You can use it like this:  ``` run_on(ast,'MyVisitor','--prefix=new',...) if not ... return False,"Failure"
- Make sure you handle all possible exceptions for better debugging and catching wrong usage etc.  Please let me know when ready! I'll provide more details as per your task requirement detailing the code structure, imports used in this example program are assumed already done by now but please make necessary adjustments if not correct according to actual requirements of a project or organization’s naming convention for FSM states.
