Here's a simple example of how you could structure your module to perform this task using PyVerilog and argparse for creating CLI arguments, re for regular expressions handling text transformations etc.: 

```python
import pyverilog as pv
from verilog import ast_pb2
from collections.abc import Iterable
import json
import os
# from typing import List
re = __import__('re') #Python's built-in module for regular expressions operations 
argparse =  __import__( 'argparse' )  	#To parse command line arguments in python, argpase is used. 
parser  = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="Change the bit width of multiple signals at once")    #Creating a parser object to get input from user by using add_argument() method inside if loop and then calling .parse_args(); which returns arguments passed in as command line inputs (if any).
parser.add_argument('-f', '--filepath' , type=str, required = True )   #Creating an argument for file path - f is short form of --file 
Args =  parser.parse_args()   	#Parses the arguments passed from command line to get all details like name and other information pass during run time in a list format (for example: python3 xformscript.py -f "C:/Users/name/Desktop/testFileVerilog")
filepath = Args.filepath   #getting file path  passed by command line arguments, ie., C:\users\desktop..../...etc(user will pass the full paths of verilogs in CLI)   	#Parsing input argument to get all details like name and other information
```    	         		     			        									  								                                                                                   	 	   	     	       						 							                 ​                                                                                                    }}}}... etc. This is just a simple example if you want more detailed code, please provide additional requirement or elaborate on your requirements!    #For elaboration about how to use pyverilog and argparse in python
```python	  		    			      ` 	   	 					 `       ^              v         x      y z. I'm not sure what you mean by "TASK: Change the bit width of multiple signals at once" - Could someone please clarify this? It seems to be a requirement for an exercise or project, rather than something as simple and straightforward one 
I understand that it involves parsing Verilog files with PyVerilog library (which is not built-in), but I'm having trouble understanding the exact task requirements. Could you please clarify what exactly "TASK: Change bit width of multiple signals at once" means? If there are other parts or steps to follow, let me know!
