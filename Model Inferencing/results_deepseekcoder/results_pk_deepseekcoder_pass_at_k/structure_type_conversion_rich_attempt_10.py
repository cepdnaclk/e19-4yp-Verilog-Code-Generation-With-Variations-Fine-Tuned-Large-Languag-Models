Here is a Python module for your requirement using PyVerilog, re (for regular expressions), argparse and unittest libraries which you can use as reference or start from there to complete implementation based on requirements provided in task description above. 

This requires `pyverilog` library that should be already installed via pip:  ```pip install pyverilog==0.12.47-cp36-cp36m_x86_64.whl (you can find the wheel file at https://www.python.org/ftp/python/) ```
In this module, we first parse Verilog code using PyVerilog and then use a visitor to search for signals in the AST tree created by parsing of verilog source files that match given signal name (signal_name). After finding these declarations it modifies them into structs or unions based on whether they are packed/unpacked, nested structures could be handled recursively and hybrid types can also have a correspondingly modified form.
```python 
import pyverilog as pv
from argparse import ArgumentParser   # for command line interface     (Optional)      
class SignalVisitor(pv.Node):          //PyVerilog visitor class definition should match with your requirement      """Visit node and make modifications"""    def visit_assignnode(self, n: pv.AssignNode):        super().visit_assignnode(n)         #Modify assignments here... return self 
def main():                            //Main function to start transformation process   parser = ArgumentParser()     parser.addargument("verilogfile")    args = parser.parse_args()      signame='sig1', repattern, replacement   = '(struct|union) ({0}) { .'.format('.'), '.')       #Load and parse verilog file   with pv.load(), you might want to use pyverilog from source code instead of using load() function 
    tree = ...                         //PyVerilog AST creation should be done here...     visitor=SignalVisitor(signame, repattern, replacement)       #Create a PyVerify visitors instance and call its visit method on the parsed veri-log file.   pv.visit_tree()
```  This is just an example based solution not complete yet because of complexities like nested structures handling in pyverilog library for parsing Verilog source files, visiting nodes hierarchy (recursive), error checking and more details you can refer to PyVerilog official documentation or some Python tutorials.
