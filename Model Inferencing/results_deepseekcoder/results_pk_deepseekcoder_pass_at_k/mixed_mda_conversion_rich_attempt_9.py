Here is a Python module for your requirements using pyverilog and re modules, as well as argparse to handle CLI arguments. This script will parse Verilog AST from input file(s), apply visitor pattern transformation on it based on signal name provided in command line argument (`-signal_name`).
Please note that the `transform()` function is not complete and you need a way of mapping signals to their correct types, as well as handling different combinations/dimensions. This part requires more specifics about your use case for MDA's dimension type combination or dimensions in general (fixed vs dynamic etc) which cannot be provided here without additional context information on how the `transform()` function should behave with these new requirements.
```python
import pyverilog as pv
from re import sub, IGNORECASE  # For regex transformations and case insensitive matching in replacements (optional)
import argparse                # Python's built-in module for command line arguments parsing - optional if you can use python standard library. Not included here since it is very basic requirement not covered by this task example code provided above with pyverilog, re and pv modules in mind as per your requirements (only a simple CLI interaction).
import ast                    # Python's built-in module for manipulating abstract syntax trees - optional if you can use python standard library. Not included here since it is very basic requirement not covered by this task example code provided above with pyverilog, re and pv modules in mind as per your requirements (only a simple CLI interaction).
