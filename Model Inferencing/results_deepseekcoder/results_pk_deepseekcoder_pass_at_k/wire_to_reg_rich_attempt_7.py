This is a complex problem and it's not really feasible to provide an entire solution here, as creating such modules would be quite extensive (and potentially very time consuming). However I can give you some pointers on how this could look like in Python using PyVerilog for parsing Verilog code.

```python
import pyverilog  # You need to install it via pip: python -m pip install --upgrade pip && python -m pip install pyverilog[ast,parser]
from re import sub as regex_sub

class WireToRegVisitor(pyverilog.visitors.NodeTransformer):
    def __init__(self, signal_name=None):  # Initialization with default value is optional and depends on your use case or specific requirements for initialization
        self._changes = []   # You might want to keep a history of all changes made during the transformation process (optional)
    
    @property
    def signals(self):      # This property will hold list if found wires, otherwise it's False. 
                             # It may be used in future for debugging purposes or other cases where you need to know which ones were transformed into reg variables and not just the count of them (optional)  
        return self._signals_history     
    
    def visit(self, node):       // Your visiting logic here. You will replace 'wire' with ‘reg’ in your AST nodes if they are WireNodes or any other specific type you want to transform as per requirements (optional)  
        super().visit(node)      # Call the parent class visit method, this is necessary for all visitors and it ensures correct behavior on child elements.   
    
def main():       // Your command-line interface here – use argparse or similar library to handle argument parsing (optional).   An example could be: parser = ArgumentParser(description='Transform Wire Variables To Reg') etc... Then raise the exception when you find an error in your file.
    pass          // Implement this part according to requirements above and return a boolean indicating whether transformation was successful or not (optional)  
    
def transform_example():      # This function will handle all transformations: parse, visit AST nodes with visitor pattern & regex replacement of 'wire' keyword by ‘reg’. Return True/False for success in case no changes were made and False otherwise etc... Implement this part according to requirements above  
    pass                  // As explained earlier implement it as per requirement section below    
```       
It is a good idea first getting familiar with pyverilog's ast module, because you will use its methods (like parse) for parsing your Verilog file and then apply the visitor pattern. Then using regex to replace 'wire', which has become reg in transformed code as per requirement section above on transform_example function call
