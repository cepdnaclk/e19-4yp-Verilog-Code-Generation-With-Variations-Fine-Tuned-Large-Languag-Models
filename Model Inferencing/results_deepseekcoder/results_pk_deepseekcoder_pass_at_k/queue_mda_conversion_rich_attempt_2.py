Based on your requirements, I have made a Python module that implements this task using PyVerilog for parsing and analysis of Verilog/SystemVerilog AST (Abstract Syntax Tree), regex to perform transformations in text files, argparse as command-line interface handling etc. 
Please note: This is not an exhaustive solution but it should give you a good starting point on how your task can be accomplished by modifying the existing xform framework patterns based upon these requirements I have provided below for reference purposes only and does not guarantee perfect functionality or error correction in all cases due to lack of information about actual source code, AST nodes etc.
 
```python  
import pyverilog as pv
from re import sub
import argparse
    
class FixedArrayToQueueTransformer(pv.NodeVisitor):    # Inheriting from existing xform framework pattern using PyVerilog's Node Visitors
      def __init__(self, signal_name) -> None:   # Initialize the visitor class with your target declarations (signal name in this case). 
          self.signals = []   
          
     ...(continue from previous code...)      
        
def transform(inputFilePath : str , outputfilepath):      # Main function to perform transformations on a file using PyVerilog's AST parser and regex replace method  
        ast, directives  = pv.parse([input_file])  # Parse the input Verilog/Systemverilog code with pyverilgo’s parse API   
         visitor = FixedArrayToQueueTransformer(signalname)     # Create a Visitor instance using your signal name  
        ... (continue from previous function definition...)      
          modified_content  = sub("pattern", "replacement" , content )  # Use regex to replace the fixed array declarations with queue syntax.    Modified Content is stored in 'modifiedContent' variable     
         f = open(outputfilepath, mode=’w+')     ... (continue from previous file handling)  
        f . write ((Modified content))  # Write modified code to output File      
          return True if there are no syntax errors else False    # Return true on success otherwise false.     
          
def main():         # Main function for command line interface using argparse module    
            parser =argparse.ArgumentParser(description='A script that takes a Verilog/Systemverilgo code and transforms fixed arrays to queue-based multi dimensional array')   ... (continue from previous parsing)   
           inputFilePath =  args .inputfilepath  # Get the path of Input File    
            output_dir =args.outputdirectory      # get Output Directory Path       
             calltransform(Input file,Output directory )       return if there are syntax errors else False   ......continue from previous code...   
           run main() at last in your script  ... (end comment)        
```          This is a basic guideline for the implementation of such task. For more complex tasks you might need to go deeper into each node and process them as per requirements, including handling multi-dimensional arrays etc., but this should provide an outline on how it can be achieved using PyVerilog's AST parser API in Python which has already been used for other similar projects like xform framework.
