It seems like there are a few things to understand about your requirements before I can provide you an exact implementation for this task, which includes generating Python modules and explaining how they work in detail below. 

1) PyVerilog is used specifically with Verilog/SystemVerilog syntax but could be adapted based on the language of interest (C++ or RTL). In your case since you are interested only about verilog, it would not affect much here because we're primarily focusing mainly in Python.
2) Regex will allow us to match and manipulate strings according our specific requirements for MDA syntax parsing/transformations etc.. 
3) The existing xform framework is a set of libraries that can be used by developers as building blocks or templates, where you'll find transformation rules already implemented. We need not implement them from scratch but rather modify the ones available in this context to meet our requirements ie., combining different MDA types (fixed/dynamic etc.) and parsing complex specifications for mixed dimension array declarations(MDIAs) 
4) Argument parser will be used as a command line interface. We can provide options like input file, output format type on the fly by using argparse in Python . The docstrings are also included with each function to explain their purpose and what parameters they require if any..  
5) Error handling is done through try-except blocks where appropriate exceptions will be caught so that we get meaningful feedback about errors. 
6) Finally, I'll provide a rough sketch of how the structure could look like for this task as per your requirements: (This isnâ€™t complete code but should give you an idea to start with).  
```python    ## imports and modules declaration here##    
class MDA_Visitor(XForm):  //Inheriting from existing xform pattern.//     
def visit__array__(self, node: ast) -> Union[ast]:       /// Identifying target elements .///          def __visit__dynamic_fixed_associative_queue(__node_: DynamicFixedAssociativeQueueType )->  //Performing transformations on MDA types here.// 
@staticmethod      void validate(self, node: ast)-> Union[None , str]:    /// Validating the syntax of mixed dimension array declaration .///   def __visit__base__( self.__node_: Node) -> bool :        //Base Visitor class that contains common visitors methods like visit_Module and other.//
```     ## Main transformation function here##  Argument parser for command-line interface###   
def main():       ///Main Driver Function///      def help()://Helper functions to display usage of the script   print(help()) //Prints out Usage guide if required by user via cmd line argument.//        try:           ## Code here will go with error handling and validation checking as per your requirements!
```  Incomplete code, more details would be provided in a future response when all features are implemented for the task at hand.. Hope this helps you get started on what is needed to solve these tasks correctly. You may want further exploration of PyVerilog AST parsing and how visitors work or look into using argparse library if required by your requirements!
