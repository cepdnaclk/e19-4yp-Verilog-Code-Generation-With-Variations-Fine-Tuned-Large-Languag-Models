Firstly, we need to install pyverilog and re modules if they are not installed yet in our python environment using pip as follows : 
```python
pip install PyVerilog-ast numpy argparse pandas rdflib transformers sklearn networkx matplotlib seaborn pydotplus lxml graphviz pygraphviz jinja2 sympy scipy tensorflow==1.9 re keras torch nltk gensim
``` 
Next, we'll define a visitor class and main transformation function:
Here is the code snippets for that :  
The `transform` method of our Visitor will perform all transformations according to your requirements like changing module names in declarations. The changes are made directly inside this file without any need from other files (other than Python's built-in libraries). 
```python
from pyverilog import parse, analyze_ast as aa
import re #Python library for working with regular expressions  
class MyVisitor(aa):    
    def __init__(self , oldname: str = None ) ->None :            
        super().__init__()        
       self.oldname=oldname 
      self._changes_made   = []          #List to hold changes made by visitor  
           print(f'Visitor with {oldname} name initialized')    
    def visit_(self,node):             
        if isinstance ( node , aa .Node ) :            
            for item in dir(node)  -> int:                 #Iterating each attribute of the Node object  
                try:                        
                    getattr (item , str('name'))    => None    else continue                    
                       self._changes_made.append ('Found {}'.format ((self .oldname)))              return super().visit_(node)  End method def transform(inputfile :str, outputfile   name=None)-> bool:      print (f'Starting transformation of file { inputFile}')        
    #Parses the Verilog AST           imports_ast = parse(''.join([open ('myverigofile.v', 'r').read()]))  Defines our visitor and parses verilog code        newvisitor  =  MyVisitor(oldname='yourOldName')    
    #Performs the AST traversal         for i in aa .traverse (imports_ast):      print ('Traversing Node',i)       &lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;  newvisitor.visit( imports\_ ast )   Replace all occurrences of oldname with the same name inside outputfile    for i in os . listdir ('./'):        if '.v' ==os \_. path\ [ -3:]:         open ('output_files', 'w').write    
```  Opening and closing braces are left uncommented. This code is a start on creating the transformation module for your framework according to requirements described above, with all changes made in place without any need from other files (other than Python's built-in libraries). Note that you have t o call `transform` method providing appropriate file names as parameters:
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":   # Checking whether the program is being run directly or imported into another module.  print(f"{'Main'}")    transform("myverigofile.v",'newfile')      exit (0) if you want to quit after transformation end of file:
```     Note : This code assumes that your Verilog files are present in the same directory as this Python script and it is run from a terminal or command line with appropriate permissions set up on Unix-like systems. For Windows, PyVerilog's AST parser might not work directly due to its different handling of whitespace compared to other parsing tools like ANTLR4 in Java/C# which can parse the Verilog code better than this Python based tool but for now it should serve as a good starting point.
