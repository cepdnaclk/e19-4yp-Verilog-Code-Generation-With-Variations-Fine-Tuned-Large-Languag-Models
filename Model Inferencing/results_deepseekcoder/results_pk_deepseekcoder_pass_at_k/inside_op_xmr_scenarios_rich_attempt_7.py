Based on your requirements, here is a high level overview of how you can structure this project and provide test cases for different scenarios in Python using PyVerilog (a parser generator). 

Firstly, install required packages by running `pip install pyverilog` command if not installed already. You also need to have ASTs ready from your Verilog/SystemVerilog source code files which can be generated with tools like csv2ast or ast2csv in PyTorch (Python).

1) Create a visitor class: 
```python
import pyverilog as pv
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
class XMRVisitor(ABC): # Custom Abstract Base Class for Visitors. This is an example only and not necessary in your actual project but can be used to extend the functionality of other visitors too if needed 
    @abstractmethod
    def visit_node1(self, node: pv.Node) -> None: ...   # Define abstract methods based on nodes you want visited ie Declaration or Statement etc... (replace 'pv' with actual parser module name from pyverilog library in your project). 
```   
2) Create a main transformation function that uses visitor and PyVerilog to parse, analyze & transform the source code:  

You can use `parse_file` method of each AST node for parsing. For example if you have an ast with nodes representing Declarations or Statements in your Verilog/SystemVerilog file(s), visit them using visitor and perform transformation as per requirement (replace 'node' by actual parser module name). 
```python
def transform_example():   # Define function for the xform framework. Replace these with appropriate functions if needed based on project requirements in your existing library or toolset.)   
     inputFile = "inputfile"                  # Input file path/name and type (replace '...' by actual inputs). 
     outputFile  = pv.parse_file(inputFile)   # Parse AST using pyverilog to get ast object from the source code of an Verilog or SystemVerilog file (.sv, .v files are used in this example only as they represent a common extension). 
     visitor = XMRVisitor()                   # Create instance/instance variables for your custom Visitors. (replace '...' by actual names if needed)  
      ...                                      # Traverse and visit the AST using defined methods of visited object(s), perform required transformations on nodes as per requirement). 
     modifiedContent = visitor.__visit__(outputFile)    # Perform necessary modifications/transformations (replace '...' by actual name if needed in this function. It is assumed that your custom Visitors have a __visit__ method to traverse and visit the AST using defined methods of visited object(s). 
     ...                                      # Write output content back into file as per requirement.).  
```     
3) Create command line interface: Use argparse module for this (replace '...' by actual commands if needed in your existing library or toolset.)   
4) Documentation/Code comments are important parts of good programming practice. You may use Sphinx, Javadoc style documentation as well which will help others and yourself understand what the code is doing at a more granular level (replace '...' by actual comment explaining specific points). 
```python
import argparse   # Module for handling command line arguments in Python   
parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="...")     # Create Argument Parser with description as per requirement if any.)     
 parser.add_argument("input", type = str, help =  "Input file name")  # Adding a new argument that takes an input string (replace '...' by actual details).  
parser.add_argument('--output', default="..." ,help=  ...)     # Provide the description for output and set its defaults if not provided else provide it as per requirement.)   
``` 
Note: This is a high level structure, you may need to adjust based on actual project requirements or toolset. Also make sure that your AST nodes are correctly generated by tools like csv2ast (for .csv data) and ast2csv( for parsers output). If not possible then use PyTorch's available parser libraries in Python, you may need to adjust the structure based on those as well if they donâ€™t fully meet your requirements.
