Here's a skeleton of how you could structure such module in Python, using argparse for CLI and PyVerilog to parse Verilog/SystemVerilog files (it seems this functionality is missing from standard library).  Note that the implementation assumes we are working with simple signal declarations.

```python
import re
from pyverilog import load_file, Module, SignalDeclarationError   # assuming you have a function for parsing Verilog/SystemVerilog files and catching exceptions raised by PyVerilog functions 
                                                                # Note: This is not standard Python library. You might need to install it with pip or use third-party libraries such as pyvlangparser, ply etc.  
import argparse                         
                                                                   
class SignalXForm(object):                  
     def __init__(self, old_width=None, new_width=None ):           # Initialize the widths (if not provided in CLI)                    
         self._old_bit = int((8 / math.log2(int(new_width))).real if old_width else None   # Assuming you are replacing all bit sizes with new size, and we're dealing only one type of signal here   
                                                                                   
     def visit_(self):                  // You would replace '_', 'visit_, etc.' in this pattern. This is where the magic happens!     
         self._do_transform()          # Call your own implementation to perform actual transformation  and error checking            
        return True                     // Return whether there was an issue or not   for debugging purposes                 
                                                                                   
     def _fail_(self, msg):                // Error messages are more informative here. This is where you would add them up   
         raise Exception(msg)              # In this case we'll simply throw exceptions (which Python will catch and print out nicely).  
        return False                      // Return whether there was an issue or not for debugging purposes                 
                                                                                   
     def _do_transform_(self):             // Your transformation should be implemented in here. This is a placeholder                
         raise NotImplementedError("'Your implementation goes here.'")  # Throw this error if you donâ€™t have the specifics           
          
def main():                           
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="Change signal width.")   // Define command-line interface            
                                                                                   
    group1 = parser.add_argument_group('Required arguments')  # Required args for CLI             
      
     gargs, unparsed  = parser.parse_known_args()           # Parse the unknowns                    
      if not unparsed:                                      // Check that we got everything           
          main(sys.argv[1:])                              # Call this method with all arguments except for script name             
   else :                                               
       print("Not enough positional parameters")             # Print message in case of insufficient args                
                                                                                   
if __name__ == "__main__":                  // Define the main function (entry point)              
    sys.exit(not SignalXForm(*gargs.__dict__).visit_())      // Run your code  and catch exceptions if any        
```  
This script is a starting template to get you started in creating such an xform module for signals' bit widths change using PyVerilog, argparse (command-line arguments parser), re(regular expressions) & error handling mechanism. For complex signal declarations or larger files/system it will be more complicated and would require parsing mechanisms which are not provided by standard Python libraries like pyverilomg etc., you'll have to use third party packages such as ply, lxml for example .
