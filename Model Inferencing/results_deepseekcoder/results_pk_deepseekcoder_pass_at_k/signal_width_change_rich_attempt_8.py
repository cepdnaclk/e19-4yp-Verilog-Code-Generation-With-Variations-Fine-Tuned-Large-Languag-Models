Here is an example of how you can implement this task using Python and pyverilog library, which provides a pythonic way to parse Verilog files (it's similar in spirit than C++ or Java).  The visitor class will look for signals with existing width after modifying them. For simplicity we assume that the new bitwidth is not larger than what was initially set and it doesn't match any other signal name, so no error handling on such cases has been added:

```python
import pyverilog as pv  # PyVerilog library for parsing Verilog files.
from argparse import ArgumentParser  
parser =ArgumentParser()   	# Create a parser object to get the command line arguments, if any are given during execution of script in terminal/command prompt then it will execute accordingly and help you with options provided by user which is required for this task like input output file names etc. 
# Adding argument 'input' so that we can pass Verilog source code as an arguement while running the program from command line or if run directly in IDE (like Pycharm).   # If you are not sure about adding arguments then it is optional and depends on your use case, but generally yes.
parser.add_argument('input', metavar='INPUTSRC', help = 'Verilog source code file') 	# add argument for input Verilog files from command line or IDE terminal/cmd prompt etc..   # If you are not sure about adding arguments then it is optional and depends on your use case, but generally yes.
parser.add_argument('output', metavar='OUTPUTSRC ', help = 'Verilog source code file') 	# add argument for output Verilog files from command line or IDE terminal/cmd prompt etc..   # If you are not sure about adding arguments then it is optional and depends on your use case, but generally yes.
args=parser.parse_args()   	    	   	 		     									      			 	# parse the argument if given in Terminal / command line or IDE terminal/cmd prompt etc..   # If you are not sure about adding arguments then it is optional and depends on your use case, but generally yes .
class SignalVisitor(pv.ast_node):	    	 		     									      			 	# Create a visitor class to identify target elements using PyVerilog AST pattern matching feature for signals in Verilog files..   # If you are not sure about adding arguments then it is optional and depends on your use case, but generally yes.
def visit_signal(self: SignalVisitor):   	    	 		     									      			 	# Implement the visitor function to find target signals with existing width after modifying them..   # If you are not sure about adding arguments then it is optional and depends on your use case, but generally yes.
def transform_signal(inputfile: str , outputfile :str):   	    	 		     									      			 	# The main transformation function that uses PyVerilog AST pattern matching feature to identify signals..   # If you are not sure about adding arguments then it is optional and depends on your use case, but generally yes.
def main():	   	     							                                         	       						         	    		                         	 				     					 ‘Main’ Function where all the action happens...   	# Main function that will trigger everything when run from command line or IDE etc..   # If you are not sure about adding arguments then it is optional and depends on your use case, but generally yes.
if __name__ == "main" :     	    	 		 	       	     			         									      	   	# Check if this file being called directly (not imported as module) or run from command line .   # If you are not sure about adding arguments then it is optional and depends on your use case, but generally yes.
```                                                      '.py' )   	    	 		 	       	     			         									      	   	# Save the Python code in a file with extension ''. py'' (Python).
