Here is a sample Python module for your requirement using PyVerilog and re (regular expressions). Please note that you need to have pyverilog installed in order to use it, as well as other necessary dependencies such as argparse which allows command-line interface creation etc., along with the xform framework patterns.

```python
import sys
from collections import namedtuple
try:  # Python3+; no need for try/except blocks here since we're only calling a function and not trying to run it, but if you do want that... then include this block too (it will catch errors).  
    from pyverilog.ast_nodes import *       // Import all ast nodes module – replace 'pyverilog.*' with the correct path for your project’s structure and modules depending on where it is built or installed in current environment if you are not sure about location of specific file/module
except:   # Python2 - same as above. Replace these lines to handle exception based python 3+ version compatibility when importing pyverilog module (like from future importer() and replace 'pyverilog.*' with the correct path). If not using PyVerilog, then you can remove this part of code which is related to it.
    pass   // No operation in Python2 - just for compatibility purpose when importing modules or functions during development process (optional) – if we don’t use pyverilog and all the functionality will be same as before with only difference between python3+ syntax etc., but required module/function may not exist.
    
# Import your xform framework's patterns here, so that you can make transformations on AST nodes using those methods in Visitor pattern below – replace 'your_xform.*', if necessary use the correct path from where it is installed or built to this environment (optional).   // This line importing will only be executed when pyverilog's ast module exists.
from your_xform import *   
    
XFormNode = namedtuple('XFormNode','module name content')  # Define the structure of a X-ray node in AST - replace with actual information if necessary (optional). // This line is used to parse and analyze Abstract Syntax Trees. Each time you run xform function, it will generate new nodes based on your requirements/scenarios which are then passed into visitor functions for further transformations etc.,
  # Define the structure of an AST node in a way that pyverilog can understand (optional). // This line is used to parse and analyze Abstract Syntax Trees.
