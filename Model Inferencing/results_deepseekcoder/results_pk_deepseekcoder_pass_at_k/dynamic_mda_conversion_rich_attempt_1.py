Here's a basic example of how you could structure your Python module to achieve this task using pyverilog for parsing and transformation, re for regex handling etc.: 
```python
import argparse
from collections import namedtuple
import inspect
import os
import sys
sys.path.append(os.getcwd()) # add the current working directory into python path to access our modules in this same dir (ex: from xform_module import *).  This line is necessary if you have moved your module somewhere else and did not update argparse or any other imported function
from pyverilog.parser import PyVerilogParser, VerilogTreePrinter as VTParser # You might need to adjust this according the version of our modules in pip installations 
import re   # Python's built-in module for regex operations (re) is needed here... I hope so! ;-) Please make sure it has been included. Otherwise, you will get a syntax error when trying importing any other function from these libraries into your codebase or to try running the script in an IDE that cannot interpret Python modules dynamically
from xform_module  // This is where we need place our custom visitor class and its methods (visit) - how it should look like, but this will be filled according with actual requirement. It might include a method for error handling etc., depending on what you're aiming to achieve here...  
from xform_module import transform  // This is where we need place our main transformation function which uses the visitor and its methods - how it should look like, but this will be filled according with actual requirement. It might include a method for error handling etc., depending on what you're aiming to achieve here...
```  
Your implementation can then follow these steps: 
1- Parse Verilog file using PyVerilogParser and convert the tree into another structure (AST) that is easier accessible with visitor pattern. In your case, it might be better if AST nodes are named "Node" or something similar so you could easily find them in codebase by traversing through all instances of this class
2- Implement a custom Visitor which can visit and process the tree (which now is an Abstract Syntax Tree) using Python's builtin features. In your case, it should search for fixed arrays declarations within nodes that are either Decl or Node types in AST(since we have to find signals from Verilog files), when a signal name matches with given one then make changes and append them into list of "changes_made"
3- Implement the transformations using regex. This will depend on your specific requirements, but if you're looking for something simple like replacing fixed array declarations or any other similar operation use this approach to perform text manipulations in Verilog source code files 
4- Include proper error handling and validation (e.g., check whether input file exists etc.). Use Python builtin exception mechanism here, so you can handle exceptions during the whole process gracefully which is a very good practice for writing robust scripts like this one! If something goes wrong while parsing or transforming an AST then exit with failure status and print out detailed error messages.
5- Finally return success/failure flag based on whether all transformations were successful (True)还是 not(False).  You can use Python's inbuilt 'sys', os, argparse modules for this part of the task too! It depends upon your requirement if you want to include them or not...

Please run it on a local machine with appropriate Python interpreter installed as per these instructions above in order to achieve desired result using provided example of framework (FRAMEWORK EXAMPLE) — if you need assistance, feel free for further clarification!
