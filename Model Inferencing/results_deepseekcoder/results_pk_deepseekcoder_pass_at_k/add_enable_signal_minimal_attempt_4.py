Here's a Python module for your requirement using pyverilog, re (for regex operations), and argparse to handle CLI arguments.  Note that this is just an example of how you might structure it; actual implementation will depend on specific requirements or constraints in the xform framework system Verilog/SystemVerilog uses:
```python
import pyverilog as pv
from re import search, DOTALL
import argparse

class CounterXForm(pv.transformer):  # This is a visitor class based on pattern from existing xforms... not an exhaustive list; you'd need to fill in the rest yourself by understanding how Verilog/SystemVerilog ASTs are constructed and parsed according to your specific use case
    def __init__(self, increment_patterns):  # You would capture these patterns from existing counter increments... this is just a placeholder for now. For actual work you'd need an implementation of CounterXForm visitor class which will identify target elements in AST and perform the transformation itself using regex
        self._incrementPat = increment_patterns if isinstance(increment_patterns, list) else [increment_patterns]  # capture patterns for counter increments here... this would be a parameter that you'd pass when running your script. For actual work it needs an implementation of identifying and performing transformations on AST based upon the received increment pattern
        self._enable = None  
    
    def start(self, ast):  # This function is called for each file parsed... here we just set up our enable signal (if not already done) in this block. In actual work you'd need a more comprehensive implementation to capture and setup the 'increment_patterns', enabling logic etc based on your requirements
        if self._enable: return  # If an existing "addEnableSignal" was found, we won’t be doing anything here... in real version it would actually add enable signal into AST block. This line is just a placeholder for now and should contain the actual implementation according to how xform framework works
        self._enable = pv.ast_nodes(pv.AssignStmt, target=self)  # Create an instance variable "_addEnableSignal" that will hold our generated code... we’ll use it as a placeholder here and in real version actually add enable signal into AST block
        self._enable['target'] = pv.parse_expr('counter <= counter + 1')  
    
    def visit(self, node):  # This function is called for each visited element... this line should contain actual implementation of the visitor pattern according to how xform framework works and handle increment operation if required by your requirements like in real version it will add 'increment' instruction into AST block. In case you need more complexity (like looping, branch logic etc), then use existing patterns provided
        # For now we just return current node... this is a placeholder for an actual implementation of visitor pattern based on how xform framework works and handle increment operation if required by your requirements like in real version it will add 'increment' instruction into AST block. In case you need more complexity (like looping, branch logic etc), then use existing patterns provided
        return node  # This line should contain actual implementation of the visitor pattern according to how xform framework works and handle increment operation if required by your requirements like in real version it will add 'increment' instruction into AST block. In case you need more complexity (like looping, branch logic etc), then use existing patterns provided
```  
To integrate this module with the CLI: 
- Add `parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="XForm Module")` at top of your Python file to create a command line interface for passing input parameters from terminal/command prompt using flags like so - python filename.py --enableCounterIncrementPattern 'counter <= counter + 1' 
- In the `main() function, parse arguments after creating parser and add necessary checks if enable flag is not provided then exit with error message or simply return false (if you want module to fail on missing flags).   Use argparse.ArgumentParser for command line argument parsing in Python. You can use --help option which will display the help/usage of your script at any time during execution, as shown below:
```python 
def main(): # This function is invoked when run from terminal or cmd... it reads args and calls transformer accordingly if enabled flag provided else prints error message return False   parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="XForm Module")# Create a Argument Parser object for handling command line arguments.. In real work you'd have more complex logic to read these parameters from file, environment variables etc
    args = parser.parse_args()  # parse the argument passed in cli mode   if not provided then exit with error message or return False (if required by your requirements)... Here it is for simplicity and understanding purposes of requirement only: capture enable flag here using argparser arguments pass to function, handle its presence/absence based on these flags.
    xform = CounterXForm(args.incrementCounterPattern if args.enable else [])  # create a transformer object with the received increment pattern or no patterns (if not provided)... This is an example of how you can use argparse to capture command line arguments in python and handle them as required
    xform_ast = pv.from_source(xform, 'filename') if args.enable else None  # create AST from source code or return (if not provided)... This is for simplicity of understanding purpose only: replace here with actual implementation to parse file/code into Abstract Syntax Tree based on your requirements
    xform._start()   this function would be called when parser reads the enabled flag, it should call start method in transformer object which will generate code and return true or false depending upon success. If not provided then simply returns False... Here for simplicity of understanding purpose only: replace here with actual implementation to setup/verify AST based on your requirements
    xform._visit(xform_ast)  this function would be called when parser reads the enabled flag, it should call visit method in transformer object which will handle increment operation and return true or false depending upon success. If not provided then simply returns False... Here for simplicity of understanding purpose only: replace here with actual implementation to perform transformations on AST based on your requirements
```  You can follow above steps as per requirement, it's important that you understand how xform framework works so these are the general approach in a way. In case if there is any specific logic or constraints related then provide those details and accordingly implement them into code according to need of each step provided earlier.. I hope this helps!
