```python
import pyverilog as pv
from verilog_parser import parse, NodeKind  # custom module to handle Verilog parsing and AST creation
# Import necessary modules/packages here based on your Python version or library requirements

class ArrayDeclVisitor(ExampleVisitor):  
    """A visitor class that identifies array declarations"""
    
    def __init__(self, signal_name: str) -> None:  # Initialize the base type of an array declaration. Assuming bit is initializing as default for simplicity here (can be replaced with other types if required). Default width can also vary based on requirements and AST structure's rules
        super().__init__(signal_name="bit")  
    
    def visit(self, node: Node) -> None :  # Method to traverse through the abstract syntax tree (AST), checking for array declarations. Replace this with appropriate method based on AST structure and requirements in questioning system verilog library's implementation details like how dimensions are handled etc
        if isinstance(node, pv.ArrayDecl):  # Check whether node represents an Array Declaration or not (Based upon your custom Abstract Syntax Tree)        
            for item in node:  
                self._check_item(item=item);   
            
def transform() -> bool :    
        """A function to perform the actual transformations"""  # Add docstring details as per requirement and system verilog library's documentation. Ensure it returns True/False based on success or failure of transformation operations  
        
# Command-line Interface with argparse module for command line arguments (example: python -m your_module --file=inputFile)  # Add docstring details as per requirement and system verilog library's documentation. Ensure it handles these cases appropriately based on requirements in questioning the Verilog/SystemVerilog framework patterns
    ```  
Note that this is a high-level guideline to help you get started, not an exhaustive solution for your problem as there are many details and edge case conditions needed depending upon specific use scenarios. This also assumes all necessary dependencies have been properly installed in the Python environment where it will run (e.g., PyVerilog).
