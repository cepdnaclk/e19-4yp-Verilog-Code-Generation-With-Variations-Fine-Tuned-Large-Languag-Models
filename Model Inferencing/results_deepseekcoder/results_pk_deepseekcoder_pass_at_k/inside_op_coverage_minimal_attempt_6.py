Here's a simplified version of how you could structure such an entire module in Python, using PyVerilog for parsing and generating test cases (for now). For simplicity reasons, I will limit this to just creating coverage points within some elements inside operator with random values instead than all possible use-cases. 

```python
import pyverilog as pv
from verilog import ast_pb2
import re
# from google.protobuf import text_format as tf
import argparse

class MyVisitor(pv._ASTTransformer):   # custom visitor class based on xform framework pattern 
    def visitIdentExpr_(self, node:ast_pb2.AstNode) -> ast_pb2.AstNode :           # define your own transformation rules here as per the problem requirement (e.g., use random values for inside operator etc.) and return updated AST Node  
        pass 
    
    def visitModule_(self, node:ast_pb2.AstNode) -> ast_pb2.AstNode :         # define your own transformation rules here as per the problem requirement (e.g., generate test cases for inside operator etc.) and return updated AST Node  
        pass 
    
def main(args):         
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()                       # create command line interface           
    args, unknown_args = parser.parse_known_args()      
     
if __name__ == "__main__":                    		# make sure to call the function when run as a script and not at import  point  
     main(sys.argv[1:])                          # calling it with command line arguments   		        			              									        } else {print ("Wrong usage, please use Python file in console or via IDEs")} print (pyverilog.__version__) pytest -q xform_file  to test your module
