Here is a Python module for your requirements using PyVerilog, re (for regex transformations), argparse and ast modules respectively to perform error handling & validation tasks along with creating an argument parser interface in command line of this project as well docstrings are included at each place necessary within the code. 
Let's break down what is required:
1) Importing Necessary Modules/Packages   - done using import statements and appropriate module names (pyverilog, re etc.)   
2) Creating A Visitor Class That Inherits From Pre-Existing XForms     - Done by defining a new class extending the old xform's pattern. This is also where error handling & validation would be performed  
3) Defining The Main Transformation Function â€“ done with proper parameter passing for input and output files, as well signal names     
4) Creating Command-Line Interface     - Done using argparse module to create a command line interface that can take in the necessary parameters from terminal. This is also where we will provide information about how this script should be used etc 
5) Including Docstrings   For each function, method and variable within code for better readability & understanding of what it does   
6) Integrating With Existing XForm Framework Patterns - done by ensuring that the existing xform framework's patterns are not overwritten or altered. This would be achieved through proper design principles (i.e., separation between different parts, using established interfaces and conventions etc.) 
7) Returning True/False For Success / Failure of transformation   
8) Validating The Required Input Parameters   - done to make sure all required parameters are provided in the command line interface i.e input_file output_directory signalname, error handling for non-existence files etc 
9) Performing Regex Transformations In AST      For performing transformations on code using regex and ast module's functions    which include substitution of namespaces from old to new modules   .
10) Writing The Modified Code Back To File     - done by writing the modified content back into a file.  This is also where error handling for writes would occur if something goes wrong in this step i.e., permissions issues, etc   
This solution should integrate properly with pre-existing xform framework's patterns and can be extended or adapted to include more functionalities as required by your project requirements including support of other AST nodes like classes/structures alongwith port lists preserving the same for all ports in case if any changes need done. 
This script will also handle comments updates when references are made inside modules, this is a necessary step based on how xform framework works i.,e it makes use of endmodule declarations and replaces them with new ones once transformation completes successfully or fails due to errors etc   .    If you have any specific constraints (like more complex AST structure), please let me know.
