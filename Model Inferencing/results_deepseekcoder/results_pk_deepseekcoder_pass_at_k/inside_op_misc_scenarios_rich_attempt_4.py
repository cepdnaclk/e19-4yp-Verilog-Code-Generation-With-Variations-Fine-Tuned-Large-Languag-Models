Here's a Python module for your requirement using PyVerilog and re (for regex operations). It creates an visitor class that inherits from another transformation method, implements some of its methods based on requirements mentioned above, including error handling etc., then uses this to transform the input file. 

Please note: This is a simplified example for your requirement because creating miscellaneous and edge case scenarios using PyVerilog are quite complex tasks that require manual testing cases which can be difficult (if not impossible) in Python scripting language, thus it's hard-coded here with generic test data.
Also note: Verilog/SystemVerilog parsing is a somewhat specific task and the provided code lacks error handling for all edge case scenarios found during this process which you might need to consider incorporating into your final solution as well in production environment, or handle exceptions appropriately depending on how robustly these operations should be.
Please note that Pyverilog library needs pyVerilog python bindings (pybind11) and pylint for linter checks hence install them using pip: 
```python
pip3 install --user -U pi verilog-pytools==0.9.*    # For Verilog Python tools & PyBinds, you may use this version if there're issues with the next one in future releases/updates as they are compatible (and more comprehensive) 
```python
pip3 install --user pylint   # linter for your code and other dev tasks. Make sure it is installed before running pyverilog transformations, otherwise you may encounter errors or unexpected behavior while parsing the Verilog files in PyVerilot/Pybinds bindings. 
```python
pip3 install --user argparse   # For command-line interface if needed for users to provide input and output file paths directly from terminal via CLI arguments, not required here as all transformation is done programmatically within Python script itself using pyverilog's AST parsing. 
```python
pip3 install --user ast unittest    # For testing the visitor with different inputs for edge cases and misc scenarios provided in this code example to be tested via unit tests, not required here but would certainly help if you have a suite of test scripts that use your transformer/visitor. 
```python
pip3 install --user pybind11   # Required by PyVerilog's bindings for Python and C++ alike languages (like Verilog) to work with them, not required in this case as we are using a pure python interface of the library which will handle all parsing/transformation tasks directly.
