Based on your requirements, I have provided a Python module that meets them as follows (I'm using PyVerilog for parsing and dynamic array generation). 
The following modules are required to run this script successfully - `pyverilog` library from Verilog/SystemVerilog. If not installed yet you can use pip install command:  ```pip install pyverilog``` . The other libraries such as re (for regular expressions) and argparse which is used for handling the argument inputs are also required to run this script successfully, so make sure they're already available in your Python environment.
Also note that PyVerilog does not directly support dynamic multi-dimensional arrays yet but you can use a workaround by using nested lists as array dimensions when parsing Verilog code into an AST structure: 
```python
import pyverilog as pv
from ast import For, FunctionDef, Module
def visit_FunctionDef(node):
    if node.name == 'main': # or whatever the function name is in your module (replace main with what you actually use)
        print('Found main') 
```   Then create a visitor class that will traverse through this AST structure and apply transformations: ```python
class MyVisitor(pv.ASTVisitor):
    def visit_FunctionDef(self, node: FunctionDef)->For : # change the method name according to what you actually use in your function (replace 'visit' with whatever is appropriate)  Here we are assuming that each main block contains a single statement or expression and no loops/if-statements.
        print('Found {}'.format(node))  ``` Then create an argument parser: ```python    
def parse_args(): # replace this function according to your needs (e.g., adding more arguments)  Here we are assuming that you want the user input for signal names, and output file name too as command line inputs    args = argparse.ArgumentParser()  ``` Then create a main transformation method: ```python
def transform_main(args): # replace this function according to your needs (e.g., adding more functionality)  Here we are assuming that you want the user input for signal names, and output file name too as command line inputs    def doit():   args = parse_args()     assert isinstance(args.signalname , str), 'You must provide a valid Signal Name' # replace this check according to your needs (e.g., adding more checks)  if __name__ == "__main__" :
doit(); ```    The final code can be run by running the Python file from command line or importing it into another script using appropriate libraries and calls as per requirement:  ```python     pyfile = 'your_pyverilog.py'  assert os.path.exists(os.path.abspath('./{}'.format((args)))), "File doesn't exist" else pv .ast().parse('/home/user/{0}') ().visit ('MyVisitor()').dump('./.verilog_out_{}.sv','encoding=utf-8',indent=2)```   Please make sure to replace the checks and functionality in above example as per your requirement.
