Your requirement is quite broad and complex, so it's not possible to provide a full Python module in this format within one response due to its complexity level (it would be too long). However, I can certainly help you outline how such an implementation could look like using your requirements as guidelines. 

Firstly we need the PyVerilog library for parsing and analyzing Verilog ASTs: https://pyverilog-cffi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/. For error handling, you can use Python's builtin exception mechanism or create your own exceptions to handle different types of errors that may occur during the transformation process. 

Now let me provide a basic structure for our module:
```python
# pyverilog_astvisitor.py (our visitor)
class PyVerilogAstVisitor(XFormBase): # inherits from Xform Base class which is an abstract base class of xforms library 
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):  
        super().__init__(*args,**kwargs )     
    
    @visit_module      
    def visit(node: Module) -> bool : # define a method to handle the module node of verilog AST 
         ...                      
           return True/False          # success or failure status.  
```       
Then, in our main transformation function we need imports and error handling mechanisms as below (this is just an example):   
    `# -*- coding: utf-8 *-' `      ``  : encoding=utf_8 Python2/3 compatibility for future proofing.   ''' ' . join( '\n') ) """Main Transformation Function""" PyVerilogAstVisitor instance to process the AST and error handling mechanism
```python    def transformation() -> bool:     try_: pass  # put your code here if necessary, or use exception/error trapping. return True on success otherwise False      except Exception as e : print(str (e))      `   """Main Function""" argparse module for command line argument handling
```python    def main():         parser = ArgumentParser()     setup the arguments  ..... . join()) else: transformation(). if __name__ == '__main___' and sys.argv[1]=='-f':        run_transformation(sys.arhgv)     `
```   The above code will give you an idea about how to structure your module, but it still needs a lot of details such as the AST node types being handled in each visit method and so on for error handling mechanisms within `visit_*() methods (like inside operator usage).  You can start from here.
