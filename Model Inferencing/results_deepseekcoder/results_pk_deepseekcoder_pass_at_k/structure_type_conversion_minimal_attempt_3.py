Here's a basic example of how you could implement this in Python using argparse for CLI and pyverilog to parse Verilog/SystemVerilog files, including error handling etc.: 

```python
import re
from typing import List, Union
import ast unparsed_code from 'xform' # Import the xForm code module which includes visitor pattern. This will vary based on your implementation of conversion logic in visitX() method (which is not defined here) and other methods that handle specific structures  like unpacking/packing or blasted structure representations etc
import pyverilog as pv
from argparse import ArgumentParser, RawDescriptionHelpFormatter   # Import the necessary modules from python.argparse for command-line interface    
   
# Create a visitor class that inherits pattern of existing xforms  (Not defined here)     
class XformVisitor(ast_unparsed):      
        pass         
        
def transform():   # Define the main transformation function          
            parser = ArgumentParser()    
             AddArgument('input', type=str, help='Input Verilog/SystemVerilog file')    # CLI arguments  here     
              Parse_args(parser)       
               with open (Args.File,'r+b'} as f:   // Open the input verilog and read it into memory    
                p = pyverilog.parse(''.join(f))// parse through file using PyVerilog     
                  for t in visitX_recursive(p):  # Perform transformation on parsed AST (define your pattern here)    // define how to traverse the tree    
                       pass   /* Define what should happen when visiting each node */      
               return True        /**/ Successful conversion? **/      False         """ Failure reasons ?*// In case of failure, provide details.  "          ''''             ,__doc__) # docstring for this module or function if any     )    XformVisitor()   // call the visitor on AST      
               return convert(p)        /* Call your conversion logic here */      False         """ Error in converting? **/ In case of failure, provide details.  "          ''''             ,__doc__) # docstring for this module or function if any     )    XformVisitor()   // call the visitor on AST      
```       
Note: This is a simplified example and might not cover all edge cases you need to handle in your specific use case. You would have more complex code than can be shown here, but I hope it gives an idea of how this could work!  Also pyverilog does require the Verilog/SystemVerilog language syntax parser is a separate module so make sure that has been added as well to avoid any parsing errors.
