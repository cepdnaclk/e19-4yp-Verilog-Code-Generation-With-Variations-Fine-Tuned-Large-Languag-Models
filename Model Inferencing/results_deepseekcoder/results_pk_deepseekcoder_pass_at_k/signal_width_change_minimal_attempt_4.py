Here's a basic example of how you could structure your Python module to meet these requirements using PyVerilog for parsing and transformation, regex handling in case bit width changes are required (assuming signal declarations have fixed length), argparse as command-line interface handler etc.: 
```python
import pyverilog
from re import sub
from xform.xbasevisitor import XBaseVisitorTemplate   # existing visitor pattern from the framework, adjust accordingly if needed
    
# PyVerilog Parser and AST Manipulation Helper Functions:   
def parse_file(filename): 
      try : verilog = pyverilog.parseFile('testbench/' + filename)   # assuming file is in test bench directory, adjust accordingly if needed    	      		       	   	 			          """PyVerilog AST manipulation"""   				                          pass        	       					                fail 
except Exception as e: print(str(e))      return None                           def ast_visitor():   # Creating visitor pattern from existing xforms, adjust if needed. Adjust accordingly to the type of target elements you are looking at..	pass    	   		    raise NotImplementedError('This function is not implemented yet') 
      	        pass                                                       @staticmethod def main(args):        """Main Function for command line interface"""         parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()          # define arguments here, e.g., file to be processed      return None  	    if __name__ == '__main__':    		# call the function with given args...            
```  Please note that this is a very basic example and does not cover all cases or error handling at present but should give you an idea of how it can work. PyVerilog's parseFile method takes in Python file path, which then gets passed to pyverilog for parsing the Verilog code into its abstract syntax tree (AST), this AST is what we will manipulate using our custom visitor class below. 
You should also consider adding error handling and validations at each step of your transformation process if you are going to implement these functionalities in a production environment, since PyVerilog's current version does not support direct file I/O or command line arguments yet (TODO: Add them as required). The visitor pattern is just one example on how such transformations can be performed using pyverilog AST and argparse.
