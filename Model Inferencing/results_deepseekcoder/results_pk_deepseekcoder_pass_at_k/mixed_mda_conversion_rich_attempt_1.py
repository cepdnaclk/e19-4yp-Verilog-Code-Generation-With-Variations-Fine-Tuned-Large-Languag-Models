Sure, here's a Python module for your requirement using pyverilog and re modules to parse Verilog syntaxes correctly (because of their low level nature). The visitor class inherits from an example provided by Deepseek Coder model which you may have already implemented or designed. 
Please note that this is just basic version, error handling has been kept minimal for brevity and lacks actual implementation details like signal processing etc., but it should serve as a good starting point to guide the development of your solution:
```python
import pyverilog as pv
from re import sub  # For regex transformations.
# Import other required modules if any exist, otherwise declare them here in future updates!
"""Python Imports Here."""
class ExampleVisitor(YourExistingClassName):  
    """Define your Visitor Class with the methods you need to implement!"""    
        def __init__(self , signal_name ):         # Define constructors and initializers here.      self.(parameter) = value; This is where it's done in Python, similar functions exist for all kinds of languages!    """   ExampleVisitor.__dict__['changes_made']=[]"""Define your properties (variables), you can also define their types if they have a specific type.
        def visit(self , node ): # You need to implement the `visit` method for this visitor, similar methods exist in other languages too!     """ ExampleVisitor.__dict__['signal_found']=False"""Define your properties (variables), you can also define their types if they have a specific type.
        def performTransformations(self , inputFile ): # Implement the function to parse and transform according with pyverilog's AST model!     """ ExampleVisitor.__dict__['input_file']=None"""Define your properties (variables), you can also define their types if they have a specific type.
        def main(self , argv ): # Implement the command-line interface and it will call all other functions to achieve what user asked for!     """ ExampleVisitor.__dict__['argparse']=None"""Define your properties (variables), you can also define their types if they have a specific type.
        def docstrings(self ): # Implement the function that generates documentation strings using python's built-in `doctest` module!     """ ExampleVisitor.__dict__['docstring']=None"""Define your properties (variables), you can also define their types if they have a specific type.
        def errors(self ): # Implement the function that validates and handles syntax error in Verilog code according to PyVerilog's AST model!     """ ExampleVisitor.__dict__['Pyverilog']=None"""Define your properties (variables), you can also define their types if they have a specific type.
         # Add more methods as per requirements, and handle exceptions too for proper code execution in case of errors or incorrect usage etc!  """   ]]])]]"}]}}, commenting is the only way to write multiline comments (Python's version). This can be done by using three quotes """"...""" on top.
