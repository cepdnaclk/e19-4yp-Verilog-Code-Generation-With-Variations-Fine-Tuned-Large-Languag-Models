Here is a Python module implementing your requirements using PyVerilog and Regex for text transformations in Verilog/SystemVerilog files, along with command line interface (argparse) to handle user inputs : 
```python
import pyverilog as pv
from re import sub   # python's built-in module used here instead of 're', because we need regular expressions.
import argparse    # Python standard library for handling CLI arguments in a more manageable way than using getopt or cgi etc... 
                    # The command line tool is now called `argparse` which provides additional functionality like type checking, error reporting and usage generation automatically by ArgumentParser instance methods. This makes it easier to handle user input from the terminal while still maintaining complete control over all aspects of your program's arguments handling mechanism for Python applications
                     # For example: arg_parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="A tool that does something")  and then you can add some options like -v, --verbose to those functions automatically by creating help message in the description or via methods such as `arg_parser._actions[-1].help` which returns a long-form usage string for your script.
                     # argparse also handles all of our command line argument management functionality and makes it easy with just these few lines code, what else would you need to do? Python's standard library is full enough that we can use the builtins without needing importing from third party modules! – https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html
                     # Important note: when a function’s first argument comes as arguments, it will be treated as positional parameters and subsequent ones are considered optional named parameter which means you can use or not specify the value of these options at all times they're required by your script to run effectively if one is omitted.
                     # As an example: `arg_parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="A tool that does something")` and then call parse, it will take care about providing values or not for the arguments in such a way as Python's standard library already provides this functionality through methods of Argument Parsers which have been explained above
