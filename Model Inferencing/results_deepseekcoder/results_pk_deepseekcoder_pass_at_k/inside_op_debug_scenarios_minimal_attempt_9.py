Here is a basic skeleton of what you're looking for in Python, using PyVerilog to parse and analyze Verilog/SystemVerilog ASTs (Abstract Syntax Trees), argparse module as command-line interface handling, re regular expressions pattern matching etc.  Please note that this code does not include the SHDL XMR force test cases or UCLI trace and VPI walker tests because they are quite complex to create them from scratch due to their specific nature (e.g., non-deterministic behavior).
```python
import pyverilog as pv  # PyVerilog is a Python interface for Verilog/SystemVerilog ASTs  
from argparse import ArgumentParser   
import re    

class XformVisitor(pv.XForm):     
        """A visitor that performs operations on xforms."""        
  # Your existing code here...      

def transform_xform():         
    parser =ArgumentParser()          
   // Add your arguments to the command line interface, e.g., file path argument           
     args=parser.parse_args()       
      pv.setLogFile(open("logfile","w"))  # Set log output        
       try:         
              ast =pv.readVerilog([args.filename])    // read Verilog/SystemVerilog code from the file     yielded by pyverilog           if not isinstance (ast, pv.XForm):                print("Not a xform") return         # Error handling and validation       
              visitor = XformVisitor(args)           <!-- Instantiate your custom Visitor -->          try:             ast.accept([visitor])      // Pass the instance to AST's accept method which calls visit methods on all elements in it       if not isinstance (ast, pv.XForm):                print("Not a xform") return         # Error handling and validation       
           except Exception as e:             Print ("Caught exception",e)  // Catch any exceptions that may occur during the execution          raise    
```      The error catching block inside try-except makes sure to handle errors appropriately, which is important for debugging. It also verifies whether each object visited by an AST visitor can be treated as a xform or not and provides appropriate feedback in case it isn't one of them (for instance the presence/absence check).
