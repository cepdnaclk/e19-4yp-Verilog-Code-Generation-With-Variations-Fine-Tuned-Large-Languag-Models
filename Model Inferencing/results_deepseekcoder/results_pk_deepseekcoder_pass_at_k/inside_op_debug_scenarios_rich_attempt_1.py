Here's a basic implementation of your requirements using PyVerilog and Python for parsing, regex transformations (this is just an example). This does not include all possible test cases you mentioned but should give you a good starting point to write more comprehensive tests in future tasks. 

```python
import pyverilog as pv
from re import search, sub # For regular expressions operations
# Import necessary argparse libraries for command line argument parsing if needed later on...
parser = None  
def str2bool(val):
    """Turns a string into boolean."""  val_str=str(val)     try: return bool(int(val)) except ValueError : pass      print("Not valid choice", val), sys.exit()         if not parser is None and re.match('^-r', argv[0])
def main():   # Define a function to perform transformations  def parse_args ():     global options    try:options=json . loads(argsparse arguments,stype = dict) except ValueError : pass      print("Parsed Arguments", args), sys.exit()         if __name__ == "main" main () {...}
def execute():  # Define a function to parse input file and apply transformations def transform (input_file: str , output_filename:str, signalName):     global parser   try : pv . load (" + inputFile) inp = ast.literal(inp). simplify () if not isinstance (. simp lits t 1 ) else raise Exception("Simplify only one node at a time!")    with open (input_file, "r" , encoding='utf8') as file : content...
def main():   # Define the function that will call all other functions def run(argv: list = sys . arg v) if __name__ == 'main': ... pass  else raise Exception("Can only be called from command line")    print ("Running xform on ", inputFile), execute (input_file, output. verilog , signalName )
if _ name_:   # Call the main function def: str2bool = lambda val : bool(int(val)) try ... except...  if __name__ == "main" run() else exit ("Can only be called from command line")    } catch Exception as e {print("Error ",e)}
```    
The above code is a basic skeleton for your xform framework. You'll need to fill in the details of how you want all these functions (parsing, transforming) and where they should go based on what each part does with inputs from command-line arguments or user input/interactive mode etc., as well as any custom error handling necessary depending upon your requirements for debugging tools.
