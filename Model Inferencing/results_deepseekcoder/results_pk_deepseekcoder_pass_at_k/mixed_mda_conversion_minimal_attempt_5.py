Sure, I can provide a basic skeleton of how you could structure your Python module to meet these requirements using pyverilog for parsing and AST generation, re (for regular expressions) in conjunction with argparse as command-line interface handling etc., but keep it simple because the actual implementation would be quite complex.
 
```python
# PyVerilog imports goes here...   // TODO: Replace '//TODO' comments and fill them up later based on your requirements using pyverilog module methods/functions or documentation found online. Also, you should replace it with actual modules as required by the problem statement 
import argparse    # Command line interface handling library (argparse)   // TODO: Fill this section when done filling in details about command-line arguments and functionality of PyVerilog's pyverilogen module using '//TODO'. These should be based on your requirements for user interaction with the program
import re    # Regular expressions import  (re), used to check if input is a valid mixed MDA syntax or not. This can also include regex patterns that you will use in transformation function below // TODO: Fill this section when done filling up details about what reg exp should be and how they are going into the transformations
import pyverilogen    # PyVerilog's module goes here...   //TODO Replace with actual modules as per requirement 
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod     # Abstract base class for visitors in Python (abc) - This is a design pattern that allows subclasses of the visitor to be defined and used interchangeably. You can use this along side xform framework when required //TODO: Fill details based on how you want your visit methods implemented
from typing import List, Union  # Type annotations for clarity in python code (typing) - Used as alternatives from Python's built-in types to make the program more readable and maintain better style. If needed replace 'type hinting with actual type or class if any based on your requirement //TODO: Fill this when done filling up details about what should be typed
from ast import NodeTransformer     #AST visitor in python (NodeTransfomer) - This module allows us to traverse an abstract syntax tree and apply a transformation. You can use it with xform framework for parsing, validation etc //TODO: Fill this when done filling up details about what should be the ast transformations
from pyverilogen import *   # PyVerilog's specific functions go here...  (pyverilogn) - This is a module that contains various functionalities related to generating and manipulating Verilog/SystemVerilog programs //TODO: Fill this when done filling up details about what should be in the py verilogen section.
    # These are just placeholders, you need complete them based on requirements provided above 
```  
Next we proceed with defining our visitor pattern and using it for parsing ASTs (Abstract Syntax Trees). It'll look something like this:
    `class MyVisitor(NodeTransformer): pass // TODO: Implement the visit method to create your transformations here. The function should take a node of type x as parameter, handle any necessary transforming on it and return transformed version or None if no transformation is required for that specific kind (node) */ TASK`
