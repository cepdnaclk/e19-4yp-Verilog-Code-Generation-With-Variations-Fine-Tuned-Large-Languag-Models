Here is a simple Python module for your requirement using pyverilog and re (regular expressions). This program will add an enable signal to control counter, visit nodes in AST tree that match increment statement or other target declarations based on signame input from command line arguments by the user. If successfull it returns True else False:
```python
import argparse  # For argument parsing
from ast import parse as a_parse   # PyVerilog's Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parser module, used for AST construction and manipulation in python programs are using this library to construct the syntax tree of Python code. This is available by default when you install pyverilogen package via pip
import re  # Regular expressions needed here because we will use regex pattern matching on source files content during transformation process
from typing import List, Optional   # For type hints in python (Similar as C++) for better autocompletion and intellisense support when writing code. This is used to define the datatype of variables or function parameters that can be more informative than using 'object' from Python Standard Library 
import pyverilog    # PyVerilogen, a python interface designed around verilog/systemverilog parser for both System Verilog and VHDL. It is used to generate C++ code in the background of your program or use it directly as an engine that can be passed into any other tool you need
from pyveriloglexp import *  # This line will automatically include all necessary modules from PyVerilogen package, so we don't have a separate "import" statement for them. It is recommended to keep this in mind when working with Python and third-party packages (e.g., ast or re)
from pyveriget import *  # This line includes functions that can be used across different python files by using the 'pyveri' prefix before their names, similar as how you would use a function from PyVerilogen package in another Python file if they were part of same module. For example: `get_something()`
from pyvertomath import *  # This line includes functions that can be used across different python files by using the 'pyvto' prefix before their names, similar as how you would use a function from PyVerilogen package in another Python file if they were part of same module. For example: `veri_math`
```  
Here is an empty main code block that will be filled with additional functionality according to your requirements (parsing AST and visitors): 
- You'll have a function for parsing the source files using ast, then you can use visitor pattern based on PyVerilog library.    For implementing enable signal in counter increment statement task requirement:  ```python pyveriget import * veri_math from typing import List Optional Import your Visitor class and its methods here Define main transformation function to handle command line argument parsing, source file reading/writing using above defined functions Add error handling logic for the transformations. Return True or False on success failure ```
