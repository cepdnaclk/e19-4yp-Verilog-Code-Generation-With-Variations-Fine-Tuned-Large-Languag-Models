Here is a sample Python module for your requirement using pyverilog and re (for regex operations). It's important to note that this script will be an example of how you can structure such transformation according to XForm, not as complete solution but rather starting point or guide in achieving the goal. 
Also please ensure PyVerilog is installed correctly with Python support for Verilog/Systemverilog code generation and parsing by using pip install pyverilog command on your terminal after installing python-pyverilog package if you haven't done so already: `pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/ianmcloughlin/python_pyverilog`
```Python (example)  file name="xformModulePyVerilog.py":  
import pyverilog as pv
from argparse import ArgumentParser, SUPPRESS
parser =ArgumentParser(description=  "XForm Framework Module for PyVerilogen") # create a parser object to parse command-line arguments 
# Adding optional argument -t flag and --targets parameter  
parser.add_argument("--target", type=str, nargs='+', help ="Target verilog file(s) you want Xform applied on") # adding target flags/arguments to parser object   
options =  parser .parse_args()  # parse the arguments from command line  
# import necessary modules and packages for parsing Verilogs, regex operations etc. by using 'import' statement at top of your script after argparser is defined above it in this way: `from xformModulePyVerilog import *`   
class XFormVisitor(pv.XPathTransformer): # define a visitor class that extends the pattern from existing transformations  with pyverilogen patterns   def __init__(self, targ_files=None) : super().__iniit_(targ_file: list[str]) if not isinstance (targets , type( None)) for target in targets else self.topology = pv .XPathTopo() 
# define a main transformation function by using the visitor class   def xformMain(): pass # start of your code below this line can be filled with actual logic based on requirement above and implementations needed to use pyverilog for parsing Verilogs.    If __name__ == "main":     parser = ArgumentParser(description='XForm Framework PyVerilogen Module') pass # command-line interface implementation by using argparse module   def main(): Pass 
```This is a very basic version of what you want, for an elaborate and comprehensive solution the structure can be quite complex. Also it requires more details about how to use pyverilog patterns in your specific context (like handling different contexts like procedural/initial block etc.), as well understanding Verilogs AST(Abstract Syntax Tree), regex pattern matching operations or error checking mechanisms which are not included within this simple script for the sake of brevity and clarity.
