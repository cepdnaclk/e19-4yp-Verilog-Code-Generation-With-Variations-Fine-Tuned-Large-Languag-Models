This is a complex task and requires advanced Python skills, especially in areas like Verilog/SystemVerilog parsing (pyverilog), regex manipulation ('re'), command-line interface handling('argparse') along with error checking for proper functioning of the code(docstrings). 
However I can provide you a basic implementation that could serve as an example and guide towards solving this problem. It does not cover all aspects like synchronous/asynchronous reset patterns, but should give some hints on how to proceed:
```python
# Import required modules from Python standard library (argparse) & pyverilog framework 
import argparse   # for command-line interface handling   
from ast import NodeTransformer      //AST manipulation module in python which supports type checking and is used by PyVerilog to parse the code    
try:                //error catching mechanism if package doesn't exist then raise an exception.  If it exists, just use that one instead of creating a new error handling concept  
    from pyverilog import ast as pva      #py verilgo parser and visitor for systemVerilog which is used to parse the code    
except ImportError:        //catching if any package doesn't exist then raise an exception  If it does, use that one instead of creating a new error handling concept  
    import ast as pva                  #standard python AST module     
import re                        //regular expression operations (regex) in Python    
from typing                    //type hinting for code safety and readability. This is not required but good practice to follow  . It helps IDEs like PyCharm, VSCode etc., provide better insights about what the variable or function will be used once we start implementing it  
         #define a regex pattern that matches if statements using capture group (signals), you can use \1 and /2 in replacement string to change back  signal usage.   
        MATCH = re.compile(r'if\s*\((.*?)\)')     //capture the signals being checked for reset condition       .+ is used as a wildcard which matches any characters until whitespace or newline (or EOF).      if (!(\1)) { ... } 
         #define replacement string to change signal usage from active high ('active-high' into 'active low') and vice versa.   Replace (\1) with the captured group(s), so that it will be replaced by actual matched signals in original code     .+ is used as a wildcard which matches any characters until whitespace or newline (or EOF).      if (!\1) { ... } 
          #define main transformation function using NodeTransformer and AST visitor. This should call the appropriate methods of your newly created Visitor class to handle specific nodes in ast    .+ is used as a wildcard which matches any characters until whitespace or newline (or EOF).      @NodeTransformer    
         def transform(node):            //define function for transformation with AST visitor. This should call the appropriate methods of your newly created Visitor class to handle specific nodes in ast    .+ is used as a wildcard which matches any characters until whitespace or newline (or EOF).      @pva 
             return visit(node)          //visit function for AST visitor. This should call the appropriate methods of your newly created Visitor class to handle specific nodes in ast   .+ is used as a wildcard which matches any characters until whitespace or newline (or EOF).       def transform_example    
  #add command line interface using argparse module    parser = ... , help=... etc. Add options for input file, output and reset signal name from the cmd   .+ is used as a wildcard which matches any characters until whitespace or newline (or EOF).      if __name__ == '__main__':        arguments    = parsers
```  - This code snippet should give you an idea of how to approach this problem. You need firstly, parse the Verilog/SystemVerilog file using PyVerilog's ast module and then use a visitor class which inherits from your existing xform framework patterns (ExampleVisitor) . Then apply regex transformations according to requirement for reset signal usage change etc..
