Here's a basic implementation of your requirements using Python and pyverilog library for Verilog/SystemVerilog parsing, AST construction (pyparsing), regex matching(re) etc.. Please note that this is just an example module you can modify it according to the specific use case.

```python
import argparse  # Command line argument parser  
from pyverilog import PyVerilog as PV, ast
import re       # Regex for matching text patterns    

class RenamerVisitor(PV._ModuleASTNode):    # Visiting visitor class that matches target elements by pattern in declarations and assignments 
        def __init__(self, old_name: str, new_name:str) -> None :  
            self.old_name = re.compile('^'+re.escape(old_name), re.IGNORECASE|re.MULTILINE | re.DOTALL )    # Compile for matching whole word only  (not partial matches due to '.' in patterns)
            self.new_name = new_name  
        def visitModuleASTNode(self, node: PV._ModuleASTNode):     return None         
        
def renameSignalInDeclarationsAssignmentsReferences(oldName : str ,  newName :str ) -> bool:# Renaming function   
      try:   # Try block for error handling and validation. (Check if old_signal already exists)                                                  
            pv = PV()      
            
            astTree=pv._parse(inputFilePath, 'r')  # Parse Verilog/SystemVerilog module to AST   
        
        except Exception as e:   # Catch block for handling exceptions. (Print error)     return False if not validated or raised exception in try-catch blocks                 
            print(str(e))          
            
          visitor = RenamerVisitor(oldName, newName )    # Create instance of visiting class  with old_name and replacement name     
        
        astTree.visitChildrenNodesTailRec(visitor)   # Perform visit on the AST (rename signals in declarations/assignments). It will recursively go through all nodes, performing actions as per visitor rules    return True if no errors occurred else False    
``` 
Please note that this is a very basic and generic implementation of your requirement. You need to make sure you handle the case where oldName does not exist in any signal declaration/assignment or reference within inputFilePath file, etc.. Also it's important for real-world usage cases (e.g., large Verilog modules), there are more advanced ways like using pyverilogâ€™s C++ API which provides a higher level interface to manipulate the AST after parsing from source code or directly build an abstract syntax tree, etc..
