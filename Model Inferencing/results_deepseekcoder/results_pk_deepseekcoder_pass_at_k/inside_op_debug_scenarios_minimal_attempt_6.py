Here's a skeleton of how you might create this module in Python using argparse for CLI and PyVerilog to parse Verilog/SystemVerilog AST, while incorporating error handling & validation as described above (in pseudocode).  This is quite an extensive task so let me give some high-level ideas:

```python
# Import necessary libraries. You will need pyverilog and re for this part but you may want to add more if needed based on the complexity of your test cases/patterns (e.g., from xform import *). 
import argparse, re, sys   # For command line argument handling & validation etc...
from abc import ABCMeta, abstractmethod    # Abstract Base Class for visitor pattern to ensure all visitors have a similar interface ...    
from pyverilog import VerilogModule as VM      # Use this if you're using PyVerilog library. 
  
# Visitor class that uses the XFormVisitors ABCMeta Pattern:    (This is your base visitor pattern).
class xform_visitor(metaclass=ABCMeta):    
@abstractmethod      # Abstract method to be overridden by each specific visit.  ...  
def VisitSomethingElse(*args, **kwargs) :        pass         ......    end of abstract class definition.....      
# Implement the actual text transformations (This is where you'll write your regex).     .....      # Handle CLI parsing & argument handling etc....          def execute(self):           ...  return result             if __name__=="__main__":            parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()                ......
```   Your module should look similar to this:
 ```python    class DebugTestCasesVisitor (xform_visitor) :     def VisitSomethingElse(self, node):         # Implement the actual text transformations here...        return result          if __name__=="__main__":              parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()             ......
```   You will need to expand on this skeleton as per your requirements (e.g., for debug and tool-specific test cases, trace driver/load functionality tests etc.).  PyVerilog has not been used in the above code but you'll be using it with AST transformations if needed from there too..
   This is a high level overview of what will need to go into your module. Implementing everything correctly would require more detailed work and knowledge about Verilog/SystemVerilog syntax & semantics, as well as regular expressions for the transformation tasks you've mentioned above (which are quite complex). 
   Please note that this code should be run from a Python script using command line arguments. Argparse is used to parse these CLI options and validate inputs in real-time while executing your program with given flags/options, allowing flexibility based on the requirements of specific test cases you've mentioned above (e.g., debugging tools or tooling functionality).
