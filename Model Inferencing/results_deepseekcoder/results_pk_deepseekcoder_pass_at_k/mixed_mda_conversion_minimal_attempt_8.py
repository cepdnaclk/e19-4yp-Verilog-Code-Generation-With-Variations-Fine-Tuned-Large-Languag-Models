Here is a skeleton of how you can structure your Python module for this task, using pyverilog to parse and analyze the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), visitor pattern from an XForm class in order to identify target elements/nodes based on their location within AST tree or other criteria. 
I will use regex as a method to perform transformations of MDA syntax:

```python
# Import required modules & packages  
import pyverilog    # PyVerilog is used for parsing and analyzing the System Verilog code/ast    
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod  // Abstract base class in Python to define an interface with only one method 'abstract' by default. This helps us when we need a template of what our XForm should look like  
import re    # Regular expressions module for pattern matching and manipulating strings    
from argparse import ArgumentParser     
# Importing appropriate modules/packages based on your requirement – pyverilog etc., you can add more as per requirements.  For example, if we are using queue or list data structures then these packages should be imported accordingly  
   
class XForm(ABC):     // Abstract class is a blueprint for creating object types in Python (abstract base classes)     
       @staticmethod        # A decorator to declare that the method can only access static methods – useful when we want our visitor pattern functionality as per your requirement.  
    def visit(self, node):         // This is a template function for visiting each and every type of nodes in abstract syntax tree (AST)     
       pass     # Implementation will be provided by child classes or specific visitors depending on the nature/type of target elements we want to transform – based upon your requirement.  
          
class MyVisitor(XForm):    // Specific Visitors for each type and combination should inherit from this class     
       def visit_variableDeclaration(self, node):         # Visit function specifics will be provided by child classes or different visitors depending on the nature/type of target elements we want to transform – based upon your requirement.  
          pass     // Implementation for variable declaration type nodes   
           
      .      
          
def main():        /// Main Function which handles command-line arguments and calls necessary functions related with this task, like parsing from AST or transformation of MDA etc.,  is written here: Based on the requirements given above.  
     parser = ArgumentParser()    // Creates a new argument parse object for handling user inputs (Command Line)     
          .add_argument("-f", "--file")        # Defines an optional command line input (-f or --file), and gives it default value as None, so if not provided then file name will be treated like none.    // This should match with the expected pattern of user inputs in your requirement 
     args = parser.parse_args()      /// Parses out all arguments passed by users into 'arg' variable      
          filename=vars(args)["file"]         # Extracts file name (if provided), else uses default None value    // This should match with the expected pattern of user inputs in your requirement 
     if not re.match(".*\\.(sv|v)$",filename):        /// Checks whether filename has .(svg or verilog extension). If it does then proceed otherwise exit (use appropriate message to notify about this and how should be done.)    // This can also match with the requirement
          print('File is not of sv/.verilog format. Please provide correct file')     /// Message for users if they have provided wrong filename or incorrect extension – Based on your requirements, modify it accordingly   .close()      # Closes any opened files after usage to free up resources    // This should match with the requirement as well
          return        // If all checks are passed successfully then returns True otherwise False (Based upon success/failure of given conditions)     /// Modify this part according your requirements.  For example, if there was no error in file reading and writing operations etc., you can mention "return true" here   .exit()      # Exits the program with a specific message (.based on requirement), for debugging purpose
          return        // Similar implementation as above based upon success/failure of conditions.  For example, if there was no error in file reading and writing operations etc., you can mention "return true" here   .exit()      # Exits the program with a specific message (.based on requirement), for debugging purpose
          return        // Similar implementation as above based upon success/failure of conditions.

For example, if there was no error in file reading and writing operations etc., you can mention "return true" here   .exit()      # Exits the program with a specific message (.based on requirement), for debugging purpose
     else:         // Else block will execute when filename is valid as per your requirements.  For example, if there was no error in file reading and writing operations etc., you can mention "return true" here   .exit()      # Exits the program with a specific message (.based on requirement), for debugging purpose
