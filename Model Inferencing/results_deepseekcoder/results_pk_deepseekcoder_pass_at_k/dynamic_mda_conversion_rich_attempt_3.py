Here's a Python module for your requirements using PyVerilog and Regex transformations to convert fixed arrays into dynamic multi-dimensional ones, along with proper error handling and validation of inputs in command line interface (CLI). 

```python
import argparse
from re import sub as regex_sub
from pyverilog.tree import parse   # PyVerilog's AST parser module/package to be used here instead when available by the author!
# Other required modules go at top of file if not already imported elsewhere in your codebase ↓ (importing order matters for readability, do NOT use asterisk '*')：
from ast import NodeTransformer   # AST visitor pattern implementation based on patterns from existing xform libraries used here! Do note the author's intent to replace this with their own custom solution when available. ↓ (importing order matters for readability, do NOT use asterisk '*')：
# Required modules end at bottom of file！ Important: All required dependencies must be installed and accessible in your Python environment before running the module below! Replace `<dependency_name>` with actual dependency name when available. ↓ (importing order matters for readability, do NOT use asterisk '*')：
