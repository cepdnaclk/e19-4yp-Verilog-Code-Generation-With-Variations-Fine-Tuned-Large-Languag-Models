Here is a high level design of how you can structure this task using Python, Verilog/SystemVerilog and pyverilog library for parsing ASTs in SystemVerilog scripts (xforms). 

```python
import argparse
from collections import namedtuple
try: # PyVerilog is a part of the system python package. If not, it will raise ImportError when trying to load xform module from pyverilogen library path/to/pyverilognumpy_path 
    import sys
    syspath = sys.path
    if 'site-packages' in syspath: # PyVerilog is a part of the site packages, so remove it to get correct module loading paths (this works on python2 and Python3)  
        path_to_pyverilognumpy=syspath[:] 
    else :    
       pyvpath = [x for x in syspath if 'site-packages' not in x][0] # find the correct index of site packages, this will be used to append/prepend path required by PyVerilog library.  
       sys.path.insert(0,'{}/pyverigogen'.format( pyvpath ))   
        
except ImportError:    
      print('Could not find system python package (required for parsing ASTs).')             # You can handle this scenario as per your requirement, e.g., error handling or exit the program  
       sys.exit()                                                               
       
import pyverilog  # PyVerilog is a Python library used to parse SystemVerilog code and convert it into Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). It should be part of standard python package if not installed separately by you with pip install command        
from xform_module import XFormClass   # This will depend on how your transformation module 'xforms' is implemented. You need to make sure this matches what PyVerilog actually does, but for now assuming it can be loaded correctly from the same directory as pyverigogen package if installed separately with pip install command        
    
def create_parser():  # Create a function that will parse arguments passed through cmd line  
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='xform test module')      
                                     
                                                            return parsers      // Returning the parsed result which can be used in transformation or testing functions                     
def main() -> bool:  # Main function that will take arguments passed through cmd line and call all necessary transformations/tests. This is where our work actually happens  
    args = create_parser().parse_args( )      // Parse the command-line argument using above defined parser    
       return xform([arg1, arg2])  /* your transformation function here */        /* Calling Transformation Function and returning result of its execution. This can be true/false or any other suitable type for success indicator*/         }      // End main()           if __name__ == "main":         
       sys.exit(not main())            # If not successful, exit program with error code  
```  Also you should note that this is a simplified version of what your task may actually look like and there are many ways to handle edge cases in Python/Verilog such as using exception handling mechanisms or simply returning None when an expected result cannot be obtained. In addition please make sure pyverigogen library (Python part) installed before running the script, it is a separate python package required for parsing ASTs while XForm module should also have its own set of tests and transformations that can't just rely on PyVerilog as they might handle more complex scenarios.
