Here's a simple implementation of your requirements using Python and pyverilog library, which is designed for parsing Verilog or SystemVerilog source files into an abstract syntax tree (AST). This will not be complete solution but should give you the starting point to write more complex transformation module. Note that this code does require a working installation of both PyVerilog and Python:
```python
import pyverilog as pv
from verilog_tools import XformVisitor, PatternError  # Assuming these two libraries are already installed in the environment you're using to run it. If not use pip install command for installing them if they aren’t available on your system yet: 'pip install pyverilog'.
import re
from argparse import ArgumentParser   # For creating a CLI interface, useful library that can handle argument parsing in Python programs ‘argparse' is included. If not use pip for installing it if they aren’t available on your system yet: 'pip install argparse'].
```
Now let us create visitor class to identify target elements and perform the actual transformations using regex pattern matching, error handling etc :-):  
This code should be extended according with real MDA types (associative array) that can represent complex data structures. For now I will assume a simple one Dimensional Array as an example: 
```python
class XformVisitor(XformVisitor[str]):     # Assuming the existing xforms are already defined in pyverilog for strings only (MDA types)   :-|    You can extend this code to support other MDA's based on your requirements.  Use appropriate PyVerilog methods and adjust accordingly
                                           Based upon target elements found while parsing AST, perform transformations using regex pattern matching:     use pyverilog regular expressions or similar tools that could help create a more complex one for handling different dimension combinations in MDA's syntax :-|    Use error handling to report any errors during the transformation process and return appropriate results.
```   This is just an example code, you need complete implementation according with your requirements:  Example of XformVisitor (visiting AST nodes) can be found at 'https://pyverilog.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/index.html#module-PyVerilog_xforms'
   Now, let us create a main function to handle command line interface and docstrings:  This would look something like this after your visitor class is implemented :   ```python     def xform(file):         pass        if __name__ == "__main__":             parser = ArgumentParser()            # Add arguments here, such as file name etc.           args = parser.parse_args()          try:                with open(args.filename)  read the verilog source code into a string for parsing    pass        except FileNotFoundError:# Handle exceptions and provide user friendly error message         print("File not found!")   Return False/Exception in case of failure
```     You can add more functionality to your main function as per requirements, such handling complex MDA's based on the parsed AST etc. Be sure this code will work with any Python program that parses Verilog or SystemVerilog source files into an abstract syntax tree (AST). Also note pyverilog library is not fully featured and may have some limitations compared to more complete alternatives, it might be a good idea for large scale programs in which case you would want the capabilities of alternative libraries.
