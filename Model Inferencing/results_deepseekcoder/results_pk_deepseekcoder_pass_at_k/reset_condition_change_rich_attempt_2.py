Given your requirements, you can write a Python module to perform this task using pyverilog for parsing and analysis of Verilog/SystemVerilog ASTs (Abstract Syntax Trees), regex for text transformations and argparse for command-line interface creation as follows:

```python
import re
from ast import NodeTransformer, Decl  # Assuming you have a custom declaration node class in your codebase. Change accordingly if not the case.
try: from pyverilog import parse_exprs   # For parsing Verilog expressions for sensitivity analysis purposes only (you need to install it using pip). Replace with appropriate method call based on where this is used or what you have available in your project. 
except ImportError as e: print(f"pyverilog not found, please use alternative methods like veripool.") # Alternative way for parsing Verilog expressions if pyverilog isn't installed by default (you can install it using pip). Replace with appropriate method call based on where this is used or what you have available in your project.
from argparse import ArgumentParser   # For handling command-line arguments, add the necessary code here to parse and use these args as needed throughout the program: 
def find_reset(node):    // Define a function that will be called recursively for each node during AST traversal (you can replace this with whatever method you have available). This is where your logic should go.   # Replace accordingly if not using existing functionality in argparse or ast module to parse command line arguments
def transform(input_file, output_file):    // Define a function that will be called at the end of transformation (you can use this as place holder for actual transformations) 
# Add necessary imports here. Replace accordingly if not using existing functionality in argparse or ast module to parse command line arguments:   # Assuming you have already defined functions and classes according to your requirements, replace with appropriate code based on the design of these functionalities/classes used elsewhere within this project (if any).
```  // Add necessary imports here. Replace accordingly if not using existing functionality in argparse or ast module for parsing command line arguments:   # Assuming you have already defined functions and classes according to your requirements, replace with appropriate code based on the design of these functionalities/classes used elsewhere within this project (if any).
```python  // This is where all transformations should be done. Replace accordingly if not using existing functionality in argparse or ast module for parsing command line arguments:   # Assuming you have already defined functions and classes according to your requirements, replace with appropriate code based on the design of these functionalities/classes used elsewhere within this project (if any).
