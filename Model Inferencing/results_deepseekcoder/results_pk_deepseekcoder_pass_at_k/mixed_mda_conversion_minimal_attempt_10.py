Here is a basic implementation of your request using Python and pyverilog library to parse Verilog/SystemVerilog syntax, as well regex for pattern matching in string operations. For error handling you can use try-except block that will catch exceptions if any occur during the execution process such us type mismatch or invalid regular expression etc..

```python
import pyverilog  # Python's library to parse Verilog/SystemVerilog code using AST approach and its own parser. It is a wrapper around ply (Python Lex-Yacc) which can be found on GitHub, we use it here for parsing the source codes in our project
import re  
from argparse import ArgumentParser  # To parse command line arguments from users' inputs when running this program directly via CLI. For example: python my_program -f filename.sv > outputfile; can be used to run a file, you just need call your function with the appropriate parameters in order for it work correctly
import ast  
from inspect import getargspec  # To see what arguments are required by functions inside our module such as xform(args) here is how we use this. Calling method will return tuple of (what args should be passed, number/type hint). For example: def add_two(): ... function call mymodule.add_two()
from inspect import signature   # To get the argument names in our functions for error handling or logging purposes when debugging your code such as print(signature("myfunction")) will give you "a=1, b=2" which is what a user of this would see if they call function like: my_addition() with 3 arguments.
import xform   # This should be an existing transformation library in Python/SystemVerilog that can convert arrays into different types (fixed, dynamic etc.) and perform complex operations such as queueing or associative array manipulations based on the input MDA type specification given to your function(s). It is out of scope for this example.
from sys import argv   # To get command line arguments passed when running python script from CLI like: $python3 my_script -f filename where 'my_script' and '-f',filename are inputs being fed into the Python interpreter during execution  by calling argumentParser('$which is a built-in module in sys')
import inspect   # This can be used to get argspec of functions for debugging purposes. It will give you function arguments as (arguments, return_annotation), like: print(inspect.getargspec("myfunction")) this output would show "('a', 'b'), ('c': xform)" where a=1 and b= 2 are inputs required by the user to call myFunction() then c is our parameter of type which will be used in transformation function based on it's value
from collections import namedtuple   # This can make use for creating more readable types within your program. For example: Point = namedtuple('Point', ['x', 'y'])  we could create a point as (1,2) just like this and call our function with that object to get the result of some transformation
from collections import deque   # This can be used for managing queues in your module. It is similar to Python's list but it allows efficient appending at both ends such us adding new elements from one end or removing old ones on another, so when we manage a queue data structure you may need this feature
from collections import OrderedDict   # This can be used for maintaining the order of your operations. For example: ordered_dict = OrderedDi()  then add key-value pair and get it back in their original ordering like 'a'->'b','c'->>d etc., so when you need to maintain a sequence or map data structure, this can be very handy
from collections import defaultdict   # This is used for making the dict with some initial value. For example: d = defalut_dic(int)  then adding 'a' and get it back in their original ordering like {'c':2} etc., so when you need to maintain a map data structure, this can be very handy
from collections import Counter   # This is used for counting frequency of elements. For example: c = counte(1)  then adding 'a' and get it back in their original ordering like {'c':2} etc., so when you need to keep a map data structure, this can be very handy
```    
The code above imports all the necessary libraries for parsing Verilog/SystemVerilog syntax with pyverilog library.  ArgumentParser is used in order to parse command line arguments from users' inputs and inspect module will help us see what argument names are required by a function, argspec can be utilized when debugging your code such as print(inspect.getargspec("myfunction"))
The xform should contain an existing transformation library that you mentioned is not available in this example but could provide the functionality of transforming arrays into different types (fixed dynamic etc.) and complex operations based on input MDA type specification given to a function or functions such as queue, associative array manipulations.  This would be out scope for our task at hand so we are just importing these tools that can help us in achieving the required result according your requirement but you should ensure it is integrated correctly with existing xform framework patterns and implementations if needed accordingly by adding more methods to this file or subclass of XForm class.
