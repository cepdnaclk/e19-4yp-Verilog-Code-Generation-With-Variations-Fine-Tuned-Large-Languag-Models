Here's a simplified version of how you could structure such module in Python, using pyverilog for parsing and ast manipulation part (which is not trivial to achieve):
```python
from argparse import ArgumentParser  # type: ignore[import]
# You may need more modules here based on your requirements. For example re or os can be used if you want regex in python string operations, etc..
try: from pyverilog import verilog_ast as ast   # noqa fstring [all]  type check issue with circular dep warning (pyverilog is a package for Python) - ignore this line. It should be removed once you've fixed the above one in your code
except ImportError: print('PyVerilog not found, please install it via pip')   # noqa fstring [all]  type check issue with circular dep warning (pyverilog is a package for Python) - ignore this line. It should be removed once you've fixed the above one in your code
except Exception as e: print(str(e)) raise    from typing import List, Tuple   # noqa fstring [all]  type check issue with circular dep warning (pyverilog is a package for Python) - ignore this line. It should be removed once you've fixed the above one in your code
# You may want to move all pyVerilog-related parts into separate functions or classes depending on what they do, and refactor according as per pythonic principles (e.g., use of list comprehensions instead of loops)  - ignore this line if you're not interested about the separation/refactoring
# Also handle errors properly in your code for better debugging experience when something goes wrong e.g.: FileNotFoundError, IOError etc . You can raise them as exceptions and catch these using try-except blocks.. For more info see https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#defining-exceptions
from ast import Module  # type: ignore[import]   from __future__ import annotations    FunctionDef, arg, Name, Str, AnnAssign, Subscript as sub     alias deprecation deco print(deco) for x in dir() if not callable and not x.startswith("__")  # noqa fstring [all]
import re   from typing import List    def visit_Module(*args: Any)->bool->$visitor = visitorClass('module')def main()-> 1 or False, *mainArgs() ->`enter code here`use(parse.getvalue()) and not parseError else (run([str(e)]), 0)
if __name__ == "__main__":    parser=ArgumentParser("PyVerilog Xform")     parser.add_argument('file', nargs ='?',default =  'top')   main() if runnable, print ('Failed with error: ',str(e)) else sys.exit (1)
```  The code above is a very high level overview of how you can structure the module and should be modified according to your specific requirements for parsing Verilog files using PyVerilog library in Python along with other necessary modules like `argparse`, re etc.. In this way it will allow transformation as per required by user.
Please note that verilog_ast is not a part of standard python's ast module and you need to install pyverilog separately using pip or your package manager in order for above code works perfectly fine: 
```sh   # noqa fstring [all]    command - venv/bin/python3.9 m-5 buildout[main]-buildout_default .py --user`pip install pyverilog && python myscript `doctest or equivalent for your use case e, g; x
```  It's recommended to have a deeper understanding of Python and AST manipulation before using such modules. You may need more complex code in actual implementation based on the requirements specified above which might be too long if done by one person only considering basic functionality at first glance as described here with pyverilog parsing, ast transformation etc..
