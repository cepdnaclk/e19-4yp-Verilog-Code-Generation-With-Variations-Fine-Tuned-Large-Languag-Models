Here is an example of how you can implement this task using Python, PyVerilog (a library for parsing and traversing Verilog ASTs), re (for regular expressions) and argparse(to handle command-line arguments).  The code below provides a high level overview. You will need to fill in the details based on your actual use case:

```python
import pyverilog as pv
from ast import NodeTransformer, Decl
import re
import sys
import argparse

# PyVerilog parser and AST visitor implementation -----------------------------
class ExampleVisitor(NodeTransformer):   # inherits from a pattern to identify target declarations/nodes... you need to fill this part up based on your requirements.
    def __init__(self, signal_name: str) -> None:
        self._signal_found = False         # ... and so forth for other members of the class as required by python's magic methods rules (__ init _ , etc.) 
                                            # Also add a `changes` list to track changes made. Each change should be added in format f"Found {self.name}" or equivalent... you need fill this part up based on your requirements too!  
        self._signal_name = signal_name    # ... for other members as required by python's magic methods rules (__ init _ , etc.) 
    
    def visit(self, node: Node) -> None :                         
         if isinstance(node, Decl):                               # If the input 'Node' type matches a specific class... then perform following actions. You need to fill this part up based on your requirements!  
            for item in node.list():                             # ... and so forth as required by python rules (__ init _ , etc.) 
                if hasattr(item, "name") and item.name == self._signal_name:    # If the 'node' input matches a specific attribute... then perform following actions.. You need to fill this part up based on your requirements!  
                    print("Found ",self._signal_name)             # ... else continue with other operations as required by python rules (__ init _ , etc.)

         return False                                             # Return false (or equivalent) in such cases. You may also have to handle more error situations as per requirement!!! 
     def visit_success(self, node: Node):                       # A success case that is called when 'node' input matches all of the above conditions... you need fill this part up based on your requirements!
