Here is a basic example of how you can create such an experiment in Python using argparse for CLI and PyVerilog to parse Verilog files, but note that this will require some more work than what's possible within your current context due to the complexities involved with AST manipulation. 

```python
import pyverilog as pv
from verilog_parser import MyVisitor # This is a placeholder for an existing visitor class you have implemented in Python that parses Verilog files and identifies target elements based on certain patterns, but it should be adapted to your needs. 
# Make sure the file structure matches with what's expected from pyverilog parser library as we are using PyVerilog AST here which is not fully supported by all libraries yet (like PLY or Irony).
import re
from argparse import ArgumentParser # For command line interface. 
# Add more error handling and validation if needed, based on the specific requirements of your task above like checking for empty arrays/values etc in targets before performing operations..  
def main():    
    parser =ArgumentParser()         // Define a argument parse instance to handle arguments passed from CLI        .add_argument('--file', required=True)  Parse and get the file name as an optional input parameter.      args, _ =  vars(parser.parse_args())            print("Input File : ", argv[1])
    try:         // Attempt to open the Verilog source code from command line argument provided        with open (argv [ 1 ], 'r' ) as fid     pyverilog = pv .PyVerilog(fid.read())   print("Parsed PyVerilog File: ",pyverilog)
    except IOError :         // Raise error if the source code file provided does not exist, or is a directory        raise Exception ("Input Verilog Filename Not Found")      .add_argument('--file', required=True)  Parse and get filename as command line argument.     args , _ = vars(parser.parse_args())         print("Error: Input file not found, please provide a verilog source codefilename.")
    else :                     // If open operation was successful...          try            pyverilog .accept (MyVisitor() )           if rerrores or fail == None  raise Exception ("Transformation failed. Please check your Verilog file")      print("Successfully transformed PyVerilog File: ",pyvrilog)
if __name__=='main_': main ()   // This is the entry point of a python program, this will execute when you run pyverigocodec as command line tool.  It handles exceptions and error messages for user input/file operations in Python scripts..      except Exception: print(sys .exc _info()[0]), sys._exit (1)
```  
This code is a very basic representation of how you could potentially implement this task using PyVerilog, Regex pattern matching etc. More complex tasks would require rewriting the visitor class to handle different patterns in your Verilog files or needing more sophisticated error handling and validation checks based on specific requirements above like checking for empty arrays/values before performing operations.
