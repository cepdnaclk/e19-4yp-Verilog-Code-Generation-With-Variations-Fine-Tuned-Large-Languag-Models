Here is a basic implementation of your requirement using Python and pyverilog library to parse Verilog/SystemVerilog files, PyVerilog provides an interface for parsing SystemVerilog source file into Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), then use visitors design pattern in order perform the transformations. 
Please note that you should have `pyverilog` package installed and properly configured to be able to parse Verilog/SystemVerilog files using pyverilog library, if not please install it by running: pip install --upgrade pyverilog (if your system is already upgraded) or python -m pip install PyVerilog.
Moreover you should have `argparse` module installed in Python to be able the command-line interface as well; If necessary use arg = parser.add_argument('file', type=str, help='path of a Systemverig/SystemVelog file'). 
The following code is very simplified and does not contain all your requirements but should give you an idea about how to start:  
```python
import pyverilog as pv
from argparse import ArgumentParser

def visit_signals(node):
    if node.is_signal():  # check type of the current AST element, replace with your own logic or predefined functions/classes here that match signal types to a struct / union accordingly  
        print("Signal found: ", str(pv.dump(node)))
        
def visit_module(mod):    
    mod.visit('signal', lambda n: visit_signals(n))  # apply visitor pattern here, replace 'signal' with the type of AST nodes you want to handle  
      
if __name__ == "__main__":     
    parser = ArgumentParser()    
    parser.add_argument('file', help="path of a Systemverig/SystemVelog file")  # define your command-line interface, replace 'yourFile' with the correct argument name  
      
    args = parser.parse_args()     
        
    svf_parser = pv.SvFileParser(pv._filepath=str(args.file))    
       
    for mod in svf_parser:  # iterate over all modules found, replace with your own logic or predefined functions/classes here to handle each module  
       visit_module(mod)     
```           In this code `visit_signals` is a visitor function that receives AST nodes of type 'signal', and prints their content. The other part handles the conversion from signals with struct types, you would need more complex logic depending on your requirements (e.g., pack/unpack data structures). This design can be easily extended to handle nested structure representations as well hybrid or composite datatypes according requirement by modifying these functions accordingly and invoking them in `visit_signals` function call within appropriate condition statement(s)
