Here's an example of how you could structure your Python module for this task using PyVerilog and a visitor class to identify target elements in Verilog/SystemVerilog syntax trees, which is not trivial due to language features such as increment operation on counters with enable signals. You would need some more specific details about the AST or counter increments (like how many places you can insert an assertion for each line increase) and it might be better off done by a software engineer who specializes in Verilog/SystemVerilog code transformations rather than assembling all this into one small module.
