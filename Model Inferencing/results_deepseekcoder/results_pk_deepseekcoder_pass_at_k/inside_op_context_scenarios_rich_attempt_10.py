Here is a Python module for your requirement using PyVerilog and re (RegEx). This script follows an XForm pattern where you define transformation rules in visitor classes, then apply those transformations on Verilog/Systemverilog code via command-line interface or direct invocation from the test cases. 

```python
import pyverilog as pv
from re import sub   # RegEx module for python to handle regular expressions (regex) in text data types and perform operations such a search, replace etc on strings using patterns. It's similar function like 'sub()', but uses more powerful pattern matching than the subset of Perlâ€™s regexp which is used here with re package
import argparse   # For command-line arguments parsing  in Python
from inspect import getsourcefile as getsf    # To obtain source file name using an inspection function that fetches filename from a given object. This can be helpful while debugging the code and testing cases for your script separately or under different conditions/environments, ect...   . It's similar to dirname(argv[0]) but more general in its use
import os        # For file handling related functions like open(), read() etc.  This module provides a way of using operating system dependent functionality for working with files and directores such as reading/writing data, managing named pipes or sockets among others tasks associated to the filesystems are part defined by POSIX standard
from ast import parse   # To Parse AST in Python (Abstract Syntax Trees) It's a built-in module of python which is used for parsing an expression into abstract syntax tree.  The given string should be considered as code and parsed such that the identifiers are associated with their declarations, statements result from execution etc
from inspect import Signature   # To work on function signatures in Python (Signature object represents a callable's arguments) It is used to describe methods or functions by providing information about parameter names.  This module provides functionality similar to argparse for handling command line inputs of your script and can be utilized as part of the test cases
import sys   # To handle system-related operations such reading/writing files, managing environment variables etc in Python. It's a builtin python library that holds information about arguments passed while running code or calling modules  This is handy for tests purposes to check if they are being called correctly and where your module resides
    
class ExampleVisitor(pv.XForm):   # Define visitor class with pattern from existing Xform framework in pyverilog package (based on Verilog/SystemVerilog)  . It uses AST parsing to identify the target declarations, and then applies transformations using regex patterns into content
    def __init__(self, signal_name):   # Initialize visitor with a signame as parameter for identification purpose in visitors' visit method. The changes made are stored here which is returned by this function after visiting AST tree of code  . It returns True if any change found and False otherwise (meaning no significant modifications were done)
    def visit(self, node):   # This visitor visits the given Verilog/SystemVerilog Node. The base class XForm method 'visit' is overridden here to handle different types of nodes in code graph with AST parsing and then call methods on this instance if found any match
     ...  # define other visit functions for handling inside operator usage, case statements scenarios etc...   . It returns True/False based upon the success or failure. In each function there should be proper error checking done to handle exceptions appropriately using try-except blocks as well and return appropriate values in such cases (similar functionality like if else conditions).
     ...  # define other methods for handling procedural, initial block contexts etc...   . Same goes with all scenarios above mentioned condition. Return True/False based on the success or failure of each scenario execution respectively using try-except blocks as well and return appropriate values in such cases (similar functionality like if else conditions).
     ...  # define methods for handling loops & continuous assigns, etc...   . Same goes with all scenarios above mentioned condition. Return True/False based on the success or failure of each scenario execution respectively using try-except blocks as well and return appropriate values in such cases (similar functionality like if else conditions).
