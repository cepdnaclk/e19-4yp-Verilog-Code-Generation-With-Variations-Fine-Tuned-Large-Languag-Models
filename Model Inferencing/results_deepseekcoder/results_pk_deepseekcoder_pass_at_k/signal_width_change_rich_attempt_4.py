Here's a Python module for your requirement using PyVerilog and re (for regex transformations):

```python

# noinspection PyUnresolvedReferences,PyPackageRequirementsAwarenessWarning */ /* ImportError: cannot import name 'visitor_pattern' from non-existent module '''python/pyverilog'''/* # uncomment this line and change accordingly.*/
