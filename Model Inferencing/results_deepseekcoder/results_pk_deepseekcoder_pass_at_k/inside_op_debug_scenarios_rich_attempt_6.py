Here's a simplified version of your requirements, converted to Python using pyverilog and re libraries for parsing Verilog/SystemVerilog syntax tree (AST) without creating custom XForm classes like in your original example code snippet. I assume you have already installed the necessary packages via pip:
```python
import os  # For file handling operations such as reading, writing files etc..  
from pyverilog import parse_file    # You can use any other function to load AST from a source like str or pathlib Path object. Here I'm using the pre-defined one in `pyverilog` library which may not work for your specific project if you have customized parser functionality
import re   # For performing regular expressions (regex) operations 
from argparse import ArgumentParser    # To handle command line arguments and options, similar to unittest.main() of Python's standard libraries
```    
Define a visitor that can be used for parsing:
Python code snippet will look like below in the `visitor` class definition which should include an initializer (constructor) method as well as visit methods where you would define your logic to find and modify signals.  Here, I'm assuming "signal_name" is a string representing signal name that we are looking for:
```python
class Visitor(object):    # Python does not require parenthesis when defining classes or functions so this line can be simplified by using `super()` like in existing examples  
  def __init__(self, node, signal_name=None):     # Define initialization method with default argument for 'signal name' to prevent errors if you donâ€™t provide it.   
      self._node = None       # Private attribute that will hold the parsed AST (or some kind of representation)  
      super(Visitor,self).__init__(*args,'kwargs')     # Call parent class initializer method with your parameters and keyword arguments if any 
        ...            
    def visit_node1234567890(cls):       # Method to be overridden for each specific node in AST     
         ......  
```           
Main transformation function:     You should handle command line options (args), file input/output, and signal name. For the purpose of this example I'm assuming that your files are located at `input_file` location with a default output to be written in place if no other destination is provided using flag --out=filename  
```python    python     def main():  # Main function for handling command line options and file input/output. Similar functionality can also exist within argparse module      ArgumentParser(description = 'Transformation tool') . add_argument('file', type =  str, help  ='Input Verilog File location or - out filename if not specified defaulting to stdout  
```    Here is how you might handle command line options and file input/output:  (Please note that in real use case implementation can be much more complex)     ...      elif '--in-file'.startswith(args.file):...            # File operation for reading from filename provided on the cmdline  
```python    python        with open('/dev/stdout' if not args.output else ars, in mode = "r") as f:  ...      elif '--xform':     ..          .         ...... and more similar operations...`       # File operation for writing to file provided on the cmdline  
```python    python        return True;                   // Return true if successfull otherwise false. Same functionality can exist within exception handling block as well  ...      else:                    raise ValueError('Unknown command line option' + args...)     print(main())`       # Run main function which will handle the different file operations and provide appropriate output  
```python    python         } ``` Python code for parsing AST with PyVerilog, adding visitor functionality to found signals:  (Please note that in real use case implementation can be much more complex)     ...        elif '--signal-name'.startswith(args.signals):...            # Adding signal name while visiting the node          
```python    python         self._node = parse_file('/dev/stdin' if not args['inputs'] else arg, *[arg]),     ...      elif '--out-dir'.startswith(args.output) and '.txt':...            # Create output file with modified content similar functionality can exist in this block  
```python    python         os._exit(-1 if not args['debugging'] else 0); return False;`       ...      elif '--tool-specific'.startswith(args.tools):     ..          .        ...... and more operations... ``` This is a very simplified version of what your requirements can be done, you would have to handle all possible inputs (error handling) as well which may require custom logic in each case based on the specifics provided by PyVerilog's AST representation.
