Here's a basic example of how you could structure your Python module for this task using PyVerilog and Regex to create test cases, handle virtual interfaces etc.: 
```python
import argparse
from pyverilog import parse_file
from re import match as regex_match
    
def is_target(node):    # Custom visitor function. Should be able to identify the target elements in your AST tree     
   if node.__class__ == YourModule:  # Replace with actual class names or ids of modules and classes you're interested in       
       return True                     # Return true when a match is found, false otherwise         
    
def perform_xform(node):    # Custom visitor function. This should contain the xformation logic     
   if node.__class__ == YourInterface:  # Replace with actual class names or ids of interfaces you're interested in        
       return transformed                   # Return a result indicating success/failure         
    
def parse_arguments():    # Function to handle command line arguments          
   parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="PyVerilog test runner")     
   parser.add_argument("verilog", type=str, help='Path of Verilog file')         
    
def main() -> bool:    # Main function to execute the whole process          
  args = parse_arguments().parse_args()      
        
  ast  = parse_file(filename)     
   if not isinstance(ast, list):        return False            try :             xform.visit (is_target, ast )                   perform_xform . visit((lambda node: regex_match("your regular expression",str(node))), ast  except Exception as e       print ("An error occurred in transformation.",e)         
   else                            for child in ast           try :             xform.visit (is_target,child )                   perform_xform . visit((lambda node: regex_match("your regular expression",str(node))), child  except Exception as e       print ("An error occurred during iteration.",e)
          return True      # Main function to execute the whole process    if __name__ == 'main' : main()  ```        This is a basic skeleton. You will need add more functionality based on your requirement, like for complex ASTs and transformations that involve multiple nodes/modules etc., also provide proper error handling in case of invalid inputs or exceptions occurred during parsing the file / executing transformation logic respectively.. 
Remember to replace "YourModule" with actual module names you're interested into. Similarly, make sure your visitor functions are correctly defined based on what kind of ASTs they deal with and how transformations should be done within them.(Example: For XMR use different types or structures in the ast like class/interface definitions)
