Here is a sample Python module for your requirement using PyVerilog, argparse and re (regular expressions). This doesn't cover all possible errors or validations you mentioned in requirements but should give an idea of how to approach it from scratch. 

Please note that this only works if the old name used by modules is unique within a given file as Verilog uses module names for identifiers and not just their content, so they must be globally unique across all declared entities (e.g., ports or signals). If you want to handle multiple instances of same named entity in one location then this approach would fail because the AST nodes won't uniquely identify them based on name alone but can still have duplicate names within a single file due to their content being different apart from module and instance definitions (e.g., ports, signals).

```python
import argparse  # Argument Parser for command line arguments  
from pyverilog import parse_exprs as pe, VerilogFileError   
from re import sub     # Regular expression operations to replace module names in declarations and comments.  
                  
class ModuleTransformer(pe):          
  def __init__(self, oldname: str , newname:str) -> None :        
      self._old_newname = (oldname, newname )    # tuple of the name to be replaced in a declaration and its replacement.  
      
  @staticmethod             
  def match(node):          
     return node.__class__.__name__ == 'module'           
       
        
def visit_matchingnodes_(old, new) :             # Visitor function that will call on each matching AST nodes using the provided visitor class.  
    for a in old:                               # Loop over all children of current node      (a).children  .         
     if match(a):                             # If it is indeed target element, then do transformation and recursively visit its childs/nodes      
         print ('Visiting ', a)                  # Print statement for debugging purpose.            
        self._visit_matchingNodes_(sub(r'^module\s+', new + 'module ', str(a)),new )  
         
          
def transformfile (filename :str , oldname: str,  newname: str) -> bool    # Transformation function.      @staticmethod              def match_oldnewname():        return True            else               xf = ModuleTransformer('m1',"n2")   print(xf._visit())
```          
This is a basic skeleton of the code and it lacks all necessary functionality for handling complex Verilog file transformations such as error checking, validation etc. But this should give you an idea about how to approach your problem from scratch in Python using PyVerilog's AST operations along with regular expressions (regex).
