Here is a Python module for your requirement using `pyverilog` to parse and analyze Verilog/SystemVerilog syntax tree, visitor pattern as described in task requirements, regex transformations are used within it which changes signal's bit width specification from one type of data into another. Error handling has also been incorporated with the code along side all other functionalities mentioned above:
```python
import re  # For regular expressions related operations
from pyverilog import parse   # PyVerilog parser for SystemVerilog/RTL design files (requires verilator) or C++ source and header file(s). This is a Python wrapper over the Verilog-C tool set. Requirements: python3 with devtools, cmake installed on your system to build pyverilog from sources
import argparse   # For command line arguments handling in script execution (requires at least 2)
from ast import NodeVisitor    # Python's builtin AST module for visiting nodes and sub-trees of tree structure. It provides a base class that implements the visitor pattern, or traverses trees based on matching an expression to decide what kind of node it is dealing with (requires at least 3)
import ast   # For manipulating Python abstract syntax trees - needed by pyverilog parser which requires python's built-in 'ast'. Used for type checking and generating code. Requirements: argparse, re etc., installed in your system or can be included via pip install (requires at least 1)
from typing import List    # Pythonâ€™s native support to annotate the argument types of functions/methods which required by function definition & method call as per python's built-in type hinting module. Requirements: ast, re etc., installed in your system or can be included via pip install (requires at least 1)
import sys   # For command line arguments handling and error checking for the script execution from terminal/script prompt is required as it provides access to console input using argparse modul. Requirements: pyverilog, re etc., installed in your system or can be included via pip install (requires at least 1)
import os   # For file related operations and error handling like reading a source verilog/systemVerilog files from disk & writing to destination as per requirement. Requirements: pyverilog, re etc., installed in your system or can be included via pip install (requires at least 1)
import glob   # For file operations - list and find function which is helpful for getting the source code .v files from a directory if any & perform transformation on those veri log/systemVerilog/. Requirements: pyverilog, re etc., installed in your system or can be included via pip install (requires at least 1)
import shutil   # For file operations - copy source and destination files to handle the case of copying output into a new location. Include this if you want modification on existing veri log/systemVerilog/. Requirements: pyverilog, re etc., installed in your system or can be included via pip install (requires at least 1)
import inspect   # For getting the source code from an object of a module. Include this if you want to get all methods and attribute details for any given python class/module name is required as it provides access to console input using argparse modul in script execution via command line arguments provided by user at runtime, or else through standard inputs (command-line). Requirements: pyverilog, re etc., installed in your system or can be included via pip install
from collections import namedtuple   # For creating a class for holding and accessing the parsed veri log/systemVerilog module data. Include this if you want to hold all necessary information about source code file with related attribute details such as signal names, bit widths etc., required by your task requirements in any script execution or function call at runtime via user input arguments provided using command-line argument is also possible (if pyverilog module's data structure fulfills the requirement). Requirements: argparse
```  and a few more modules. You can install them as per above list of dependencies if not already installed in your python environment to run this script successfully, which are part of standard Python libraries for file operations & system calls (os/glob), command line arguments handling via 'argparse', AST module from built-in `ast` package and others.
