Here's a basic example of how you could structure your Python module to achieve this task using pyverilog for parsing and analyzing AST, visitor pattern as well as regex transformations in python language along with error handling mechanism which is also included within the code snippet below. 

This solution assumes that PyVerilog's parse function returns a Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of Verilog files parsed by pyverilog and we are looking for arrays to be converted into associative multi-dimensional array declarations, which is represented as '`[key_type]`'. 
Please install necessary libraries before running this script. You can do it via pip: `pip install PyVerilog re argparse` . Also make sure that you have pyverilog installed and its location in your environment's PATH variable or update the path if needed otherwise, replace 'your_file.sv', '/path/to/pyverilog-module'.
```python 
# Import necessary libraries  
import re
from PyVerilog import parse    # Replace with pyverilog parser module you use for parsing Verilog files in your environment or install it via pip if not available.    
import argparse              # For command-line arguments handling     
        
# Initialize Argument Parser  
parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Convert arrays into associative multi dimensional array declarations') 
      
parser.add_argument('inputfile', metavar='INPUTFILE', type=str, help="Input Verilog file for conversion")    # input sv/v files  
    
args = parser.parse_args()     
        
def transform(svf):         
        try:                   
            ast , directives  = parse([svf])  // Parse AST of the SV File using pyverilog's 'parse function'.          
            
                                                  if not isinstance (ast, object) or len ((dir for dir in list(directives.keys()) + [node_name])) != 4:      
                            return False   // If ast and directive counts are incorrect then it returns false indicating failure     
                                else :             
                                    changesmade = []          # Create a change log to keep track of all the modifications done in this run       
                                           for node ∈ list(ast.list) + [node_name]:             // Iterate through each nodes present inside AST        
                                                if isinstance (item, Node):             
                             try:                      __          # Attempt to convert array declarations into '[key]' syntax   using regular expressions and replace() function    defn.  replacement = "[' + str(node_name)+']"     modifed content  = re . sub (pattern, replacement , node )      
                                                     with open ("outputfile", mode=’w') as f :             // Write the modified SV code into a new file           return True   __                # End of try-except block          }  raise Exception ('Error occurred during transformation.');    finally:     print (changesmade)      if not isinstance(ast, Node):        
            except exception_type as e :                   // Catch any exceptions raised and show the message in console                  return False   # End of Finally clause       try again after catching  pyverilog module or SV file.    else: pass     print ('Transformation successful!')      if __name__ == "__main__":        transform(args . inputfile)
```                      // This line is to run the script from command-line with specific sv/v files passed in arguments as 'python3 your_script.py /path/to/yourfiles'  where '/...' are paths of SV or V file(.sv, .v).   Please replace all occurrences according to actual path and types if necessary
