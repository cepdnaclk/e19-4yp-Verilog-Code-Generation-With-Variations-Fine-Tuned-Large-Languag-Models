Here's a simplified version of how you could structure such an extension to your Python module, using `pyverilog` for parsing and AST manipulation (although I highly recommend working directly into PyVerilog or looking at other tools that provide this functionality). This code does not cover all the requirements but should give you a good start.

```python
import pyverilog as pv
from argparse import ArgumentParser, RawTextHelpFormatter  # for command-line interface
parser =ArgumentParser(description='Convert arrays to mixed multi-dimensional array types', formatter_class=RawTextHelpFormatter)
args , remainingArgs  = parser.parse_known_args()  
# parse the arguments here if necessary (if not, you can leave this as is), or pass in a file name via command line argument — 'test' for example but any valid filename will do   
ast = pv.parse(' '.join(remainingArgs)) # assuming all inputs are text files to be parsed by pyverilog and should not have leading/trailing whitespaces, you may need proper handling if input is a file or string — replace 'test' with the name of your test case
# You will use argparse.ArgumentParser() here for command-line interface but this code doesn’t include that part yet because it would be too complex to handle in such simple way, you may need proper handling if input is a file or string — replace 'test' with the name of your test case
```python
class ArrayToMDAXform(pv.Module): # this class will follow xform pattern and perform required transformations on ast nodes  
    def __init__(self, array_data=None):# define a constructor that takes initial data as input if any 
        super().__init__()         pd = self + "pd"      @property       return            # you can add more properties here or in the method itself. If not provided it will remain empty and no action is taken, unless overwritten by child classes   def visit_ArrayDecl(self):  pass   
# implement your visitor methods (visit_*), these should be called when ast nodes are being visited with appropriate function calls      # This code can't perform the transformations at this stage because we have not defined what kind of data will need to undergo transformation, and how they get converted. You might want a different approach depending on requirements 
def main():# define your entry point method   def array_to_mda(ast):    pass # you can call ast here with pyverilog AST object but for now we just return true if it's not an xformable node, or else run the visitor methods and appropriate transformations.
```  You should implement your own transformation logic in `ArrayToMDAXForm` class inside method definitions (which are similar to Python functions) according what kind of data you want transforming etc., then call these by using ast object with pyverilog AST tree, so this code is a start.
