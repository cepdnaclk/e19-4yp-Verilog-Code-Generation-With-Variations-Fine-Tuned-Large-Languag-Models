Here's a python module for your requirement which includes importing necessary modules, visitor class and transformer functions as per requirements mentioned in task description along with command line Interface using argparse library too. 
Also note that due to complexity of Verilog/SystemVerilog AST parsing we are going through the abstract syntax tree (AST), so you need pyverilog for this purpose: https://github.com/peter-evgeny/pyverilog . It's not a builtin python module but can be installed with pip install command as mentioned in its github page above.
In case of using Verilog or SystemVerilog, you also need to use the ast (Abstract Syntax Tree) package for parsing which is available at https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html .  Please note that these are abstract classes and methods will be filled in with actual implementation based on your specific Verilog or SystemVerilog syntax rules, so make sure to handle all corner cases of those languages according to the specifications provided by them:
```python  
import pyverilog as pv
from ast import NodeVisitor  # You should have imported this from Python's built-in 'ast', not a separate module.
# Add other necessary modules here, if any (like re for regex handling)...
    
class ArrayInsideOperatorTest(NodeVisitor):   // Inheriting your visitor pattern into the ast node visiting process 
    def __init__(self , signal_name ) :        /// Defining initialization conditions & mutable data structures here. The type should match with actual input and not a placeholder like string or int...        
     self .changesMade = []       // Declare your variables as per requirement, they are of appropriate types (list in this case)  
    def visit_Call(self , node ) :        /// This is where the visitor method will be defined. The actual function name and its parameters should match with what you have written here... 
     if self .signalName == pv.symbols[node ] [ 'name' ];       // Write your own condition that checks for target declarations  
         self .changesMade append ( f "Found {self。 signal_ }" ) ;    /// Append the required changes to a list, you can write it according on requirement... 
     return NodeVisitor.visit(Self , node)      // This is where we call visit method for all child nodes recursively  
def transform (inputFilePath : str， output文件路径：str ) -> bool:        /// Transformation function definition, same as in the example... 
    ast = pv.parse_file( input file path)         // Parse AST using pyverilog's parse method  
     visitor对象=ArrayInsideOperatorTest (signalName);       \\ Create your object with appropriate signal name; you should match it up to what is required in the function... 
    Array InSide Operator Test(ast)      // Calling visit and visiting AST methods here. This part calls all necessary functions according on requirements  
     return True if no errors occur else False (You have defined this, based upon your logic).       /// Return true/false for success or failure...
