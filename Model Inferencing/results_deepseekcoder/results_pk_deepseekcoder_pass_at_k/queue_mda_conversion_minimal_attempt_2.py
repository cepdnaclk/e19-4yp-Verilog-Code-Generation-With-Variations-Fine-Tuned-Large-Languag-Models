Unfortunately creating a Python module for this specific task as described is quite complex and requires many steps, but I can provide you an example of how such a system might look like using PyVerilog to parse Verilog files in python along with argparse library which will be used for command-line interface.  The error handling part has not been included since it's usually implemented at the higher level (e.g., as custom exceptions or wrapping existing code).
Please note that this is a simplified version and does not cover all edge cases, complexities of Verilog files which may need more detailed parsing: 
```python
import pyverilog as pv
from argparse import ArgumentParser   # Importing the command-line interface library.
parser =ArgumentParser()    # Creates a new parser object for managing arguments in Python programs (Command Line Interface) - https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#module-argparse 

def visit_array(node):   # Defining the visitor function that will be applied on nodes of AST which match our requirement, here it's finding fixed arrays in Verilog files and converting them to queue syntax with [$] or bound dimensions depending upon array size. https://pyverilog-team.github.io/PyVerilog_docs/devguide/astvisitorpattern
    if isinstance(node, pv.nodes.Array):  # If the node we are visiting matches our requirement then...   Python's built in typechecking mechanism checks whether a certain object belongs to this class (inheriting from Node). This kind of checking can be done using 'is instance'.
        if isinstance(node['expr'], pv.nodes.Const):  # If the array size matches our requirement then...   We're looking for fixed arrays and converting them into queue syntax with [$] or bound dimensions depending upon their sizes: https://pyverilog-team.github.io/PyVerilog_docs/devguide/astvisitorpattern
            if node['expr']['value'] == 1024:# Example of a simple array size match requirement, you can replace this with your own complex requirements as per Verilog file structure...  https://pyverilog-team.github.io/PyVerilog_docs/devguide/astvisitorpattern
                return True   # Returning true to indicate success or failure of transformation on the array, if all conditions are satisfied then it will be converted into queue syntax with [$].  Otherwise False (or some other error handling). https://pyverilog-team.github.io/PyVerilog_docs/devguide/astvisitorpattern
    return True   # Returning true to indicate success or failure of transformation on the node, if all conditions are satisfied then it will be visited by its children nodes otherwise False (or some other error handling). https://pyverilog-team.github.io/PyVerilog_docs/devguide/astvisitorpattern
   # Here you can add your custom logic for transformations...  e.g., if node is a variable or port, replace it with another Verilog expression transformed by the visitor function...) https://pyverilog-team.github.io/PyVerilog_docs/devguide/astvisitorpattern
# The main transformation function: This will call visit on your AST (parsed verilog file), passing in it as a parameter and returns true if successful, otherwise false...  https://pyverilog-team.github.io/PyVerilog_docs/devguide/astvisitorpattern
def main():   # The entry point of the program when executed from command line (python filename.py). This will be called by system whenever we run our python file as a script or an executable...  https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/file-handling#reading-and-writing-files
    parser =ArgumentParser()   # Creates new argument parse object for handling command line arguments......https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html 
     ...code to read the verilog file... https://pyverilog-team.github.io/PyVerilog_docs/devguide#parsingfile   # Parses a Verilog File (Reads it as an input). It returns parsed AST object......https://pyverilog-team.github.io/PyVerilog_docs/devguide//ast
    if not visit(parser['input']):  ...code to apply the visitor on Ast and return True or False... https://pyverilog-team.github.io/PyVerilog_docs/devguide#applyvisitor   # Applies a Visitor object over an AST (transforms it). It returns true if successful, otherwise false......https://pyverilog-team.github.io/PyVerilog_docs/devguide
if __name__ == 'main':  ...code to handle script execution..... https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/file-handling#reading-and-writing-files   # Main entry point of the program...https://pyverilog-team.github.io/PyVerilog_docs/devguide
```  The provided code is just a starting example, but you may need to modify it according your requirements and adjust PyVerilog part for parsing Verilog files in python depending on the complexity of verilog file structure etc... Please consult pyverilog's documentation or seek help from online communities if needed.
