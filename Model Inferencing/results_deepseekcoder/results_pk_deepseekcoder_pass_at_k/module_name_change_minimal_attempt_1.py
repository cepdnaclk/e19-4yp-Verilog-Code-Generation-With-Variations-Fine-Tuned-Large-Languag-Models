Here's a simple Python module to perform this task using pyverilog and re libraries for parsing Verilog files, regex matching in replacement of specific namespaces or modules name etc., along error handling mechanisms as well. 
The following code doesn’t implement the full transformation requirements (like updating endmodule comments references), but shows how you can start with it:
```python
import pyverilog
from re import sub
  
class ModuleRenameTransformer(pyverilog._ast_visitor):     # Your visitor class will inherit from this pattern 
    def __init__(self, oldname=None, newname=None) -> None:       # Initialize your transformer with the target names (old and/or new module name). You can use *args to pass more parameters if needed.  
        self._old_mod = pyverilog._ast_visitor().getattr(pyverilog, 'module') 
                                                         
    def visitModuleDef(_self: '_VisitorContext', node : Module) -> None:       # Your visitor implementation will be here.  
        if _node == self._oldname or not isinstance(_node ,'str()):           # If the module to rename was found, it runs this code   
            new_mod = sub(r'\b{0}\.'\b'.format('|'.join([self._newbase]),  '\\1'), self.replacement(), node)  
             if isinstance(_node ,'str()') :                                # If the module name was found, it runs this code   
                _ast_visitor().setattr(pyverilog,'module', new_mod )          
            else:                                                         
                 raise Exception('Module not replaced. New Module Name = %s '   (new_node))  # If the module replacement failed for any reason, it raises an exception   
        _ast_visitor().generic_visit(self)     // This will call visitChildren on all children of node if they exist      return None                         
         def getattr(_mod: 'module', name : str ) -> Any   # Get the attribute from a module (similar to import in Python).  It's used here for simplicity.    Returns object or raises AttributeError         
     @staticmethod                                                                                  // Useful if you don’t want visitors of this class visible elsewhere            def replacement() : str      return 'newname'.   # This is where the actual name replacements will happen (using regexes, etc)  It's used here for simplicity.   
     @staticmethod                                                                                  // Useful if you don’t want visitors of this class visible elsewhere            def _newbase() : str      return 'oldname'.   # This is where the actual new base name will be passed in (usually __init__).  It's used here for simplicity.
```    Here, `_VisitorContext` should replace with your visitor context as per requirement and you can use it to pass parameters like old module names or paths etc., Also make sure that necessary import statements are there where required methods/objects of pyverilog library is being called ie PyVerilog needs proper setup.
The full transformation would require a more sophisticated implementation, possibly involving AST manipulation and error checking mechanisms rather than regular expressions for name replacement in the file system like Verilog does with `$rename` or dynamic modules loading etc., which might not be feasible within this scope due to complexity of both pyverilog library as well as Python itself.
