Here's a Python module for your requirement using PyVerilog, re (for regex operations), and argparse to handle CLI arguments in an easier way: 

```python
import pyverilog as pv
from verilog_ast import VerilogFileContextManager   # Assuming you have a custom AST parser for Python. This is used only if the PyVerilog does not provide one out-of-the box yet, and we need to parse it manually from string input: 
import argparse
from typing import List, Tuple
    
def replace_wire2reg(code):   # Defines a visitor function. This is your main transformation method that will be called on AST nodes when visiting them in the module's code tree (or similar data structures). The node should implement this pattern to find all 'wire', then replaces it with Reg, preserving bit-width and signal names:
    if n.type == "expression_statement":   # If a statement is an expression type...  This could be more specific based on the Verilog language you're using ... or even better would depend upon AST nodes for your code tree (i.e., not just statements). In this example, we consider only expressions as they are usually 'wire', but it may vary:
        if isinstance(n.children[0], pv.ast.Identifier):  # If the first child of expression statement node n in AST represents a Identifier (a signal or register name)...   These could be more specific based on your language and requirement, as this example assumes that signals/registers are represented by 'Identifiers':
            print(f"Warning: Signal {n.children[0].name} was found in code tree.")  # A warning will occur here for every signal (i.e., Wire) detected...   This is because we're not using a proper error handling and validation part, but you could extend this functionality as per your requirement:
            n.replace_with(pv.ast.Assignment().set_lhs([n.children[0]]).set_rhs("reg").serialize())  # Replace the 'wire' with Reg...   So each signal (i.e., Wire) is replaced by a reg in code tree and it will be preserved as required:
    return True, None     # The visitor should always end successfully or fail for failure message if there are any issues found during AST traversal ... this example assumes that all signals/registers have been detected. You may need to extend based on your requirements...  PyVerilog's parser is designed as a recursive descent, so it might not be able to handle complex cases with multiple 'wire', etc., but you can easily adapt the code for these more specific case scenarios ...
    
def main():   # Command line interface. Parses CLI arguments and calls transformation function: 
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="Perform xForm on Verilog file.")       # Adds an argument to specify a input verilog source code... this could be in the form of .v or -f <input_file>, etc.:  
     pth  =parser.add_argument('paths', metavar='PATH', type=str , nargs-1)  # Specifies that one file path should exist:     
    parser.add_argument("--out", help = "Output Verilog File")       # Adds an argument to specify the output .v or -f <output>, etc.:  
     args   =parser.parse_args()        # Parses CLI arguments into a namespace:      pth  = parser.add(...),  Here we add both inputs and outputs as before ...    print("Transformation Started")         // Prints start of transformation message to stdout, etc.:  
     for path in args.paths :       # Loops over all provided paths (each one is a file name):      with open(path,"r+" )as f:  Try-catch block here...    try/except blocks could be used as per your requirement ...         verilog_code = ""          // This will hold the Verilog code to read from input path into memory.        for line in lines :          
            if "wire" not in str(line) or ("reg" in (str(lines[0])):     # If a wire keyword is found, it should be replaced with reg ...  This could vary based on your language requirement...   print("Transitioning File {}".format() )          // Provides information about file being transformed.   
            verilog_code += line      writer(path ,verilog code)        # Writes the new Verilog to output path ...  This could be a simple string operation, or more complex depending upon your requirement...   print("Transformation Complete")          // Prints end of transformation message.
