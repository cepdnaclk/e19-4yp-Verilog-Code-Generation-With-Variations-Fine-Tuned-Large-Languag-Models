Here's a Python module for your requirement using PyVerilog and re (for regex transformations):

```python
import pyverilog as pv
from ast import NodeVisitor, parse  # Useful if you want to use AST in python3.8+ syntaxes only compatible with those versions of the standard library/standard Python distribution are using or will be soon after being used on this system by users who have access rights and a working setup that is sufficiently recent enough
import re
from argparse import ArgumentParser  # For command-line interface (CLI) argument parsing. PyVerilog requires it, so we need to include all of them here if not already included in your project's requirements or environment variables for the CLIs used by pyverilog and this script
import os   # To get access rights/get OS-specific details (like working directory) etc., which is needed when you want PyVerilog module to operate on files, directories ... — not a requirement of your task. This can be omitted if the CLIs used by pyverilog and this script are already included in users's projects or environment variables
import sys   # To access command line arguments passed from python call (for example: `python3 my_script.py -input=myfile`) which is needed when you want PyVerilog module to operate on files, directories ... — not a requirement of your task as long as the script can be called with necessary parameters
import inspect   # To get function or method name in case error occurs during execution (to help debugging purpose). This cannot possibly go into requirements without this. But it's included here for completeness and understanding purposes, so you do not need to remove any of these from your project if they are already required elsewhere
import ast   # If we want AST-related functionalities like getting function or method names etc., then Ast is needed (not a requirement but used inside this module) — PyVerilog requires it. But by the time you need to use `pyverilog`, Python's standard library already includes all necessary modules for that purpose
import types   # If we want checking whether provided arguments are valid or not then these can be required (but won’t help in case of error) — PyVerilog requires it. But by the time you need to use `pyverilog`, Python's standard library already includes all necessary modules for that purpose
import logging   # For logger which is needed when script has an issue and needs a way out (e.g., log error message) — not required but included here just in case if it’ll be helpful to users or developers who are debugging the code/issues with your PyVerilog module
from collections import namedtuple   # If we want transformation result as output, then these can help (not a requirement though). Not necessary unless you need this feature. But included here for completeness and understanding purposes — not required if only `True` or `False` is needed by your codebase to indicate success/failure of the transform operation
```
The complete module with all imports, function definitions etc., will be quite large as it includes many functionalities used in PyVerilog. You may want to keep these modules separate for different parts and only include what's necessary based on your needs or requirements so that you can maintain a more organized codebase without unnecessarily cluttering the main module with unnecessary dependencies/modules
