Given your requirements, it's clear you want a Python module to transform Verilog/SystemVerilog source files using Pyverilog and regular expressions (regex). This is quite complex because there are no standard ways of doing this in SystemVerilog or Xform framework. However, I can provide an example that demonstrates how the requirements could be implemented:

Please note you need to have pyverilog installed for parsing Verilog source files and `re` module needed if we want regex based transformations on code elements (counter increment). Also please install argparse as it is not a standard python library. 
```python
import re, sys, os
from collections import namedtuple
try: from pyverilog import VerilogParser # PyVerilog's parser module for parsing verilog source code files  
except ImportError: raise Exception("PyVerilog is not installed. Please install it using pip.")  sys.exit(1)
from argparse import ArgumentParser, FileType    from ast import NodeVisitor # necessary modules to parse and analyze Verilog ASTs with Pyverilog's parser  
```    
## Command-line Interface:      def main():        args = Args()       run(args)  @contextmanager         class ArgparseDecorator (ParserArgs):           ...             # Define the argsparser and parse arguments            if __name__=="main":          setup_argparser    sys.exit("Please provide a Verilog file")
# This is not an example, it's just to show how you could use pyverilog for parsing source files     def run(args):        with open (Args._file,'r') as f:           content =f .read()         parser=VerilogParser ()          parsed_design = 
#parser.parse('',content)  # parse the file      visit, mods  = NodeVisitor().visit    ...             // define a visitor that will perform transformations on AST nodes        if __name__=="main":       run(args))         else:           sys .exit (1 )
```   The above code is just an example and does not actually compile or work. For the actual implementation, you would need to implement your `run` function such that it will read a Verilog file from command-line arguments if one exists; otherwise print error message asking for input verilog files then continue with no action (i.e., exit). The transformations should be performed on AST nodes of the parsed design, not directly in string form representation which is required by PyVerilog's parser and Xform framework as a prerequisite to constructing an Abstract Syntax Tree that can represent code elements at various points during parsing phase. 
   Also note `visit` function needs further implementation if you want it works correctly for adding enable signal etc on counter increments in your AST nodes, not implemented here because this is complex task and would require a deep understanding of Python's built-in ast module as well Xform framework which has its own way to handle code transformations. 
   PyVerilog does have `xforms` functionality that can be used for parsing Verilog source files, but it only supports adding/removing statements directly in the AST nodes and not file or string level changes like you need here since your requirements are more complex (like controlling a counter by an enable signal). 
   So far as I understand Xform framework's capabilities is limited to manipulating code at syntactic levels. You may want consider using PyVerilog for this purpose with its `xforms` functionality, or if you do not have such constraints then manual string transformations might be the best option in terms of complexity and error handling requirements since it would require more work on implementing your transformation logic which is quite complex as per requirement description.
