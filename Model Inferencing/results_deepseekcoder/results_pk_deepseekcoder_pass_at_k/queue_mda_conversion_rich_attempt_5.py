Firstly, we need to install pyverilog and re modules if they are not already installed in your python environment using pip or conda as follows (only for Python 3):
```bash
pip install -U PyVerilog[ast] # For parsing ASTs. You may also use other versions of this package such as astunparse, pypotentialdependencies and others if needed to meet your requirements but they are not strictly necessary depending on the complexity in case you don't need all their features
pip install re 
```  
Now let's create a module for transformation. Here is an example of how we can do this: (Please note that it may require adjustments based upon actual file structure and requirements)   
(This code does not contain the command-line interface, error handling or extensive docstrings because these aspects are complex to cover in one response.)  
```python 
import pyverilog as pv
from re import sub
    
class TransformVisitor: # Your Visitor class should inherit from this pattern. You can use the code above for reference and adapt it according your requirements   
         def __init__(self, signal_name):   # Constructor – Initialize variables like in an init method of a Python object        self._signalName = None     @property      def Signal(self) -> str:          return getattr(pv.Signals[], 'SIGNALNAME')      
         if isinstance (node, pv .Node):   # Checking for target declarations – Use pyverilog's Node and Decl classes to find the appropriate nodes    def visitChildrenNodes(self , node: decl) :     self.visit ([child])        return True     
def main():            xf = TransformVisitor("SIGNALNAME")          pv .parse ('INPUT_FILE') [pv (xf)]  # Parse AST using pyverilog's parser           with open(...,'r+',buffering=1) as f: content  = ...        result   = xf.transformStringsInContent ([content])          if not isinstance ('result','True/False): raise Exception('Failed to transform')         # Write output     
if __name__ == 'main': main()   This code should be in a Python file and could then use argparse or similar functions for command-line interface.    You would call the function like this: python filename -i inputfile --signal_name signalName  (This line is not part of actual program, but it represents usage example)
```    
Please note that you need to fill in details according your requirement and error handling needs as well due to complexity involved. The above module could be a starting point for creating the required transformation based on requirements mentioned earlier using pyverilog's python package with re (for regex operations).  In case of more complex transformations, it would require defining new methods/attributes or overloading existing ones in TransformVisitor class which is not covered here.
