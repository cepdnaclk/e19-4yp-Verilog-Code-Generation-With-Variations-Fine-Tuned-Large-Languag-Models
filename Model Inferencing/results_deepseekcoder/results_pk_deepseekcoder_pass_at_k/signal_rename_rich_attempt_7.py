This is a complex problem and it's not really feasible to provide an entire solution here, as creating such modules would be quite extensive in terms of complexity (parsing Verilog/SystemVerilog files using PyVerilog which has its own set of challenges). However, I can give you some general steps on how this could work and a rough sketch for the Python module.

Here's an outline:
```python
# Import necessary libraries 
import pyverilog as pv   # Use library to parse Verilog files into AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) using PyVerilog package
from re import sub     # For regex based transformations on the text content of nodes in your module. Here, we will use Python's built-in 're' 
import argparse      # Handling command line arguments and options for our program  

# Create visitor class that implements pattern from existing xforms (use inheritance here)   
class SignalRenameVisitor(ExampleVisitor):    
    def __init__(self, old_name, new_name): 
        super().__init__(old_name)      # Call the parent's constructor and pass signal name as argument. This will fill changes made list with signals found message if any exists  
         self.new_name = new_name       # New target declaration to replace old one   
     def visit(self, node):              # Implement visitor pattern here using a similar approach from the original example 
          ...                            # Continue implementing your custom logic for signal renaming as needed...  
           self.changes_made += [f"Found {old} and replaced it with new name: '{new}'"]   
     def visit(self, node):              # Implement visitor pattern here using a similar approach from the original example 
          ...                            # Continue implementing your custom logic for signal renaming as needed...  
           self.changes_made += [f"Rename {old} to new name: '{new}'"]   
     def visit(self, node):              # Implement visitor pattern here using a similar approach from the original example 
          ...                            # Continue implementing your custom logic for signal renaming as needed...  
           self.changes_made += [f"Updated {old} in assignments and references to new name: '{new}'"]   
     def visit(self, node):              # Implement visitor pattern here using a similar approach from the original example 
          ...                            # Continue implementing your custom logic for signal renaming as needed...  
           self.changes_made += [f"Added new name to declarations: '{new}'"]   
     
# Create main transformation function      
def transform(input, output):             
     ast = pv.parse(''.join([open(i).read() for i in input]))  # Load file content into AST using PyVerilog  
          ...                                        # Continue implementing your custom logic here...   
           with open (output,'w') as f:                 # Write back transformed code to output.txt/file    
                pv.pprint(ast, stream=f)                   # Use pyverilog's print function for pretty printing the AST  
          ...                                        # Continue implementing your custom logic here...   
           return True                                # Return true if transformation successful else false 
     
# Create command line interface    
parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="Rename signal in Verilog file")       
       parser .add_argument("-i", "--inputfile ", required=True, help='Input files')           # Adding arguments for input and output filenames 
      ...                                                    # Continue implementing your custom logic here...   
     args = vars(parser.parse_args())        # Parse the command line parameters        
       if not transform(*[vars(args)['inputfile']]):           # Transform function call with arguments from arg parser 
            print('Transformation failed!')                   # Print error message in case of failure   
else:                                                       # Else part for else block after the condition check    
      ...                                                # Continue implementing your custom logic here...  ```. This is a very simplified version and will need much more work to fully implement all features as described above, including handling declarations within assignments or references instead of replacing whole words only (partial matches), error checking in case any issues arise while parsing the file/ast objects etc., also adding support for parallel Verilog files.
