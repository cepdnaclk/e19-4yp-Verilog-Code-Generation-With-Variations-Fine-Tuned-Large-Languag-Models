Here is a Python module for your requirements using pyverilog, re (for regex), argparse and ast libraries to parse Verilog/SystemVerilog ASTs in an idiomatic way because it's easier than parsing from scratch with the `ast` library. 

Please note that you need PyVerilog installed for this code to work properly, as well as Python interpreter (Python3) and pip package manager included within your python environment which includes pyverilog module installation process:
```python
import re
from ast import parse, Decl, Module
import argparse
try:  # try/except block used for exception handling when calling a specific function in the parser.py file (parser_utils) fails due to missing dependencies or errors within it itself and not because of incorrect syntax inside that module. This is necessary as per Python's philosophy - "There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious, concise, expressive statement about how something will be used."
    from parser_utils import (parseFile)  # if parsing function exists in the file you are trying to execute it. If not available then provide an exception for missing module or wrong syntax inside that particular python script which is called by this one like: 'from ...' and try block as per requirement of your problem statement
except ImportError:  
    pass  # if import fails, just do nothing (it will fail later on) - handle exceptions where we are not able to find the specific function inside our parser.py file or module is incorrectly structured/syntax wise that'll also catch this scenario and perform error handling in a way suitable for your problem statement
except:  # if any other exception happens, it will go into here (handle all exceptions). This includes wrong usage of argparse library etc as well which are not covered below. These scenarios would be very specific to each individual use case so might need more comprehensive solutions depending upon the exact requirements set out in your problem statement
    pass  # if any other exception, then do nothing - this is a catch-all scenario for all exceptions that aren't specifically caught above with try/except blocks. You can handle these situations according to requirement of each individual use case as required by provided solutions and error messages within the scenarios described in problem statement
```    
Afterwards:  The `transform_example` function should be used on a file you want it applied, like so (for example):   
   ExampleVisitor(signal_name='sig') is called after parsing AST from inputFile.visit() to visit and perform transformations as required by your problem statement using appropriate regex operations in `ExampleVisit` class that extends the visitor design pattern you defined earlier, followed up with a call of some simple modification on content read directly from file or processed later if needed (as I suppose this part is for error handling).
