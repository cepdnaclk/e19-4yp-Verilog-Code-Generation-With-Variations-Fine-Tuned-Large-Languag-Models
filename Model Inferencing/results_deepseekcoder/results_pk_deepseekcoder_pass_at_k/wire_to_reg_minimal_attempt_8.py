Here is a sample Python module for your requirement using pyverilog, re (for regex), argparse and ast libraries to parse Verilog files into an abstract syntax tree which can be traversed by visitors in order not only find all wire declarations but also perform the transformation. 
Please note that this approach assumes you have a parser for your specific language like SystemVerilog or Xcelerator, if it is different then adjust accordingly and include appropriate parsing libraries/tools to parse Verilog into an AST as well: `pyverilog` in particular should be used with the right modules (like pyxcel's verilog parser).
  
```python 
import argparse
from ast import NodeTransformer, walk_stmt
from re import sub
try: # Python3 compatibility. Remove if using python2 or older version of PyVerilog library which doesnâ€™t support Python versions newer than 3 yet (<4)
    from pyverilogpyxcelparserlibnamehere':   pass       // replace 'PyXcelfParser' with your parser module name, e.g., ast for C++ parsing or PyVerilog if using SystemVerilog/SystemC Verilog language 
except ImportError:                          # (Python2) Remove this line and above imports as they are not needed in Python3+  
    pass                                   // If we're running on python version older than 4, the code below will fail. We can ignore it or handle differently depending upon our use case later with try/except clauses for different versions of pyverilog library if required to be compatible (Python2).     # import statements here...
    pass                                   // ... and more as needed in this version  
import PyVerilogpyxcelparserlibnamehere 
from ast.literals': NodeTransformer, walk_stmt'walking the AST using visitor pattern for transformation of 'wire to reg variables'. The base class should be provided by xform framework or you can create your own based on it if not already existing   # imports here...   
    
class WireToRegVisitor(NodeTransformer):  // Your custom Visitor inheriting the pattern from visitor classes of XForm Library. This is where we add our transformation logic into place holders using pyverilog' parser and AST walk method   # imports here...   
      pass                               // ...and more as needed for this module, it can be different depending upon your use case or library constraints you are working with  if required.    
      
def main():                              // The Main function where the command line interface (CLI) is implemented and a parser gets created to understand CLIs inputs    # imports here...  
      pass                               // ...and more as needed for this module, it can be different depending upon your use case or library constraints you are working with  if required.    
      
if __name__ == 'main':                  // Checking the entry point of python and calling main function to start transformation process    # imports here...  
      pass                               # ...and more as needed for this module, it can be different depending upon your use case or library constraints you are working with  if required.    
      
if __name__ == '__main':              // Checking the entry point of python and calling main function to start transformation process    # imports here...  
      pass                               # ...and more as needed for this module, it can be different depending upon your use case or library constraints you are working with  if required.    
```       
This is a simple example showing how one might approach the problem at hand using Python and some of its libraries (such as `argparse` to handle command line arguments) along side pyverilog for parsing Verilog files into an abstract syntax tree, while ast provides tools on top that allow us to walk through this AST.
