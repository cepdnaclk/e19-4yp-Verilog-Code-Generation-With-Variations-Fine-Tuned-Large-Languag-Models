Here's a Python module for your requirement using PyVerilog, re (for regex operations), argparse and an example visitor class to change reset condition from active high to active low or vice versa based on if statement usage in Verilog code snippet provided as input. This is just the starting point of what you need - actual implementation will be much more complex due to many edge cases, complexity involved error handling etc and also it's important that this module can handle different reset types (active-high or active low) based on user inputs:
```python
import pyverilog as pv
from argparse import ArgumentParser  # for command line arguments.
  
class ResetConditionXform(pv.AstVisitor):   
     def visit_IfStatement(self, node):        
          if not self._inSync:                # Check whether we are in a synchronous or asynchronous reset pattern?                 
             newNode = pv.astops['Not']([node["condition"]])  # invert the condition to become active low/high and update sensitivity list (negedge).  
          else :                             
               return node   
          
         self._inSync=True                      # set flag for asynchronous reset pattern detected, only when we are in synchronous mode.     
      
     def visit_Module(self,node):               
        if not isinstance (node,'IfStatement') and \ 
            len([n for n in node['children']])>0: #check whether module contains any IfStatements   
           return self._inSync  
         else :                          
             raise ValueError("Module must contain at least one 'if' statement")         
        try:                
               pv.transform(node,self)           
              if not isinstance ( node,'IfStatement') and \ 
                len([n for n in node['children']])>0 : #check again after transformation to ensure success or failure           return True  
                   raise ValueError("Module did NOT contain 'if' statement")   
               else:                    
                  self._inSync=False              # reset flag when a synchronous pattern is detected. 
        except Exception as e:      
             print ("Failed transformation with error : ", str(e))     return False  
          
def main():     
          parser = ArgumentParser()        
          parser.add_argument("verilogFile", type=str, help="The Verilog file to be transformed.")       
               args = parser.parse_args()  # Get command line arguments      
               
           try:                         
                  astRoot  = pv.load(fileName)    # Load the verilog module from a given source code  
              except ValueError as e :     print ("Failed to load Verilog file with error message ", str (e))  return False     
               xform = ResetConditionXform()      
                try:                           
                      pv.transform(astRoot,xform) # Apply transformation on AST  
                   except ValueError as e :     print ("Failed to transform Verilog file with error message ", str (e))  return False     
               else:                                 
                    raise Exception("No reset condition detected in the provided code")         
           finally:        
                if xform._inSync==True :    # ensure that a synchronous or asynchronous pattern is set at last.  
                     print ("Reset type not correctly changed, please check your inputs.")     return False     
               else:                         
                    raise ValueError("No reset condition detected in the provided code")  Return True            
        if __name__ == "__main__":            main()    # Execute only when run as script and NOT imported.  
```      
Remember, this is a simplified version of your requirement which might not work perfectly for all use cases due to complexities involved with Verilog ASTs (Above code assumes that reset condition in if statement can be expressed using an 'Not' operator). Also the ResetConditionXform visitor should ideally have more sophisticated behavior based on what kind and when of a synchronous/asynchronous or active-high,active low change would actually mean.
