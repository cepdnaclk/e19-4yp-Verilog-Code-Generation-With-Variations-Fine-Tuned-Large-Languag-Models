Here is a basic structure for your Python module, assuming that you have all necessary dependencies installed and are using PyVerilog to parse Verilog files into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).  The visitor class will be used as per XForm's pattern from existing xform framework. This example does not cover the entirety of renaming a signal in your code, but it should give you good starting points for implementing this functionality:

```python
import re
from pyverilog import parse_expr, VerilogModule  # assuming PyVerilog is installed and available as 'pyverilog' package. You may need to install using pip if not already done so by running "pip install pyverilog" in your command line terminal or python file
from xform import XFormVisitor   # assumes you have an existing library for implementing the visitor pattern from a transformation framework like 'xform'.  Run `pip install <library_name>` to add it.
import argparse    # To handle CLI arguments, assuming this is installed already in Python version above35+ if not run "python -m pip install --upgrade setuptools" and then execute again the command: python -m pip install pytest (if you are using PyTest as your test module) 
import sys   # to print error messages. Include it here because argparse requires one argument, which is usually printed in case of any exception thrown by a user-provided action function or parser definition method like this: `arg = parse_args()` at the end if you provide an invalid number for command line arguments
  
def build_parser():    # To handle CLI Arguments (optional)  use argparse module to add your own options as per requirement. Let's assume we have two flags - old and new names: `arg = parse_args()` at the end if you provide an invalid number for command line arguments
   return parser    		# Add more methods, attributes or implementations based on requirements  (optional) like error handling etc as per your use case. Let's assume all of them are already implemented in this file according to requirement and standard python programming practices which is fine if you add some extra functionality later but it won’t make a big impact unless the original design provided by XForm framework was not altered significantly due these added functionalities
  	    	    # It should be noted that, because of pyverilog's limitations with Python and Verilog syntax (and their differences), transformations will require more complex handling. This includes identifying correct signal names in your module as well as correctly translating the changes into a format understood by PyVerilog or similar AST parsing libraries
  	    	    # Also, pyverilog's capabilities may not be able to handle every case (like partial matches) due its design. Your mileage will vary depending on how you structure your regex pattern and if/how the visitor visits different elements of a Verilog module – please customize as needed
  	    	    # The PyVerilog library does require some setup, which we are not covering here but can be done by following their installation guide https://pyverilog.readthedocs.io/, and it's recommended to have an understanding of how AST works before attempting the whole process as explained above
  	    	    # Finally also note that this is a very high level solution, actual implementation will depend on specific requirements (like more complex signal renaming or other transformations) – see further explanations in PyVerilog's documentation and xform library’s docs. They have many examples of how to perform your task
  	    	    # Also note that you might want a different approach for handling command-line arguments, as argparse is not designed with CLI interaction directly – if this functionality was needed in the current implementation then it may be worth considering other approaches such as using `click` module which can handle interactive mode and has better support.
  	    	    # Lastly remember to check your code against all possible edge cases, especially when you are dealing with Verilog/SystemVerilog syntax – this is a complex area of development but it's crucial for making sure that everything works as expected! This script provides an overview and should be used in conjunction.
