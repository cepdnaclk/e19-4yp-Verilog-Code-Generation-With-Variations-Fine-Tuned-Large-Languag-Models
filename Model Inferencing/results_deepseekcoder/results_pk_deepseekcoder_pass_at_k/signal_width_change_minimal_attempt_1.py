Here's a simple example of how you could structure your module in Python to meet all requirements listed above, although it will be much more complex than what is provided here due to many factors such as error handling and validation that are not covered by this question (but which should still apply). 

For simplicity we start with the visitor class:
```python
from pyverilog import ast_nodes as nn, transforms, ir
import re

class BitWidthTransformer(transforms.PatternRewriter):
    def __init__(self):
        self._match = None  # for error handling and validation later on...        
    
    @staticmethod
    def matches_node(n: nn.Module) -> bool:         
       """Return True if this visitor should apply to the given node."""  
      return isinstance(n, (nn.SignalDeclaration))  # or other types you want it applied too...        
    
```   
The Visitor class above does not do anything as per your requirements but serves just for identifying target elements and applying transformations on them using PyVerilog AST operations like changing bit width of signals etc, however this is still a very basic representation.  For more complex implementations you would need to extend the visitor methods or create new ones specific with each kind/type signal that your code will handle (regs, wires...)
  
The main transformation function could be something as simple:    
```python
def xform_bitwidth(module):    # assuming 'xforms' is a list of transformers... 
       for t in module.transformations():      ...         yield from t          ..              .apply()           if not callable(t) else apply[type](call, *args);            continue               break     return False  ```        This simple function should be enough to get you started but is more complex as it does require knowledge of how your PyVerilog AST and transformations work.
    The command-line interface could look something like: 
 ```python
def main():      ...         parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()           .add_argument('verilog', type=argparse.FileType("r"))          args, verilogfile  = parser.parse_args())       module =  ir.load(next(iterable))    if not xform_bitwidth(module):   ...         print ('Failed')
if __name__ == 'main':  main()     ```     This is a simple example of how you could structure your command-line interface and the transformation function in Python, but would need to be expanded upon significantly for actual use.    It's also important that we include proper error handling (i.e., try/except blocks around operations where errors might occur), as well validation on inputs such as file names or paths mentioned by users from command line arguments and so forth... 
   For the full requirements, you would need to add a lot more functionality here but these should give start points for your project! Please remember that pyverilog is very complex library which requires deep understanding of both Python scripting language (with its own set/package libraries) as well as Verilog dialect.
