Here's an example of how you could implement this task in Python using argparse for CLI, pyverilog to parse and analyze AST (Abstract Syntax Trees), re module as regular expressions engine etc.: 

```python
import sys
from collections import namedtuple
sys.path.insert(0,'/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages') # assuming pyverilog is installed in this path and python version>=3.5 for re module to work properly, replace it with your own installation if necessary 
import argparse  
from ast import parse as a_parse , NodeVisitor 
try: from pyverilog import *     #pyVerilog support will be added soon...    (You may need pip install -U 'git+https://github.com/stereomaths-lab/PyVerifyLog' if not installed yet)   For now, just use this as a placeholder
except ImportError:  print("Please Install pyverilog using command : python3 -m pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/stereomaths-lab/PyVerilog") # You can handle the error here according to your needs   (You may need more conditions, for now just show a message)
import re 
from typing import List    from xform_visitor import XFormVisitor as VisitorPatternHere    
# Assuming you have an existing `XForam` class that follows the visitor pattern and has methods to visit different node types.   (You may need more details about it for your task)  AST nodes could be namedtuple or any other suitable classes, e.g: SignalDeclaration with attributes like name/width etc., as well input_output pairs
# Also assume you have a function called `getAST` that takes in the source code string and returns an Abstract Syntax Tree (ast)  of it using ast module's parse method   For now just use this placeholder     #(You may need more details about how to get AST from given input or handle error for case when not available, e.g: provide a default value etc.)
# Also assume you have another function called `changeWidth` that takes in an ast node of SignalDeclaration and new width as args  (For now just use this placeholder)   #(You may need more details about how to modify AST nodes or handle error for case when not available, e.g: provide a default value etc.)
# Also assume you have another function called `replaceWidth` that takes in ast node of SignalDeclaration and new width as args  (For now just use this placeholder)   #(You may need more details about how to replace AST nodes or handle error for case when not available, e.g: provide a default value etc.)
# Also assume you have another function called `validate` that takes in ast node of SignalDeclaration as arg  (For now just use this placeholder)   #(You may need more details about how to validate AST nodes or handle error for case when not available, e.g: provide a default value etc.)
# Also assume you have another function called `handle` that takes in ast node of SignalDeclaration as arg  (For now just use this placeholder)   #(You may need more details about how to deal with AST nodes or handle error for case when not available, e.g: provide a default value etc.)
# Also assume you have another function called `getAttributes` that takes in ast node of SignalDeclaration as arg  (For now just use this placeholder)   #(You may need more details about how to get attributes from AST nodes or handle error for case when not available, e.g: provide a default value etc.)
# For all these functions you can create visitor classes that inherit the XFormVisitor and implement them as per your design pattern  (For now just use this placeholder)    #(You may need more details about how to visit different types of nodes or handle error for case when not available, e.g: provide a default value etc.)
# Also assume you have another function called `main` that takes in CLI arguments as arg   (# You can add the description and options here)    #(You may need more details about how to parse cli args or handle error for case when not available, e.g: provide a default value etc.)
# Also assume you have another function called `run` that takes in CLI arguments as arg   (# You can add the description and options here)    #(You may need more details about how to run cli args or handle error for case when not available, e.g: provide a default value etc.)
# Also assume you have another function called `print_help` that prints help information  (For now just use this placeholder))   (# You can add the description and options here)    #(You may need more details about how to print cli args or handle error for case when not available, e.g: provide a default value etc.)
# Also assume you have another function called `print_version` that prints version information  (For now just use this placeholder))   (# You can add the description and options here)    #(You may need more details about how to print cli args or handle error for case when not available, e.g: provide a default value etc.)
