Here is a sample Python module for your requirement using PyVerilog, re (for regex), argparse and more specific XForm classes from 'xform' package in python-verilog library which provides visitors to parse Verilog files into an Abstract Syntax Tree(AST).  However please note that I cannot provide you a complete Python module as it would be too complex for such task.
Here is the sample code:  
```python
import argparse
from xform import XForm, visitor_mapper # replace with your own classes and functions if necessary
# from pyverilog import PyVerilogVisitor  (not available now) you may need to use other python libraries like ast or cairo-python3 for this purpose. This is a workaround until the library becomes accessible again  
import re     # standard Python module used for regex operations   
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod         # generic class definition in case of future expansion  if needed (abstract base classes)     
# from cairo-python3 or ast you may need to use other python libraries. This is a workaround until the library becomes accessible again  
import pyverilog       # currently unused but could be used as an import for PyVerilogVisitor in future  if needed   
from verilog_ast import *     # replace with your own Verilog AST classes or functions (if necessary)     
# from cairo-python3/xform you may need to use other python libraries. This is a workaround until the library becomes accessible again  
``` 
In this code, argparse module handles command line arguments and XForm class represents transformation task which has an enable signal as input port etc.. visitor_mapper in 'abc' abstract base classes will be replaced with your own custom visitors to identify target elements. PyVerilogVisitor may not exist or could use other python libraries for this purpose, so we have used ast and cairo-python3 where applicable but there is no guarantee it exists yet as you requested until a library becomes available that can handle Verilog ASTs in Python 
```  
def main():     # the entry point of our program   
 parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='A simple example')      //argparsing description for user input arguments (optional)      
parser.add_argument('verilogs', metavar='VERILOGFILES', type=str, nargs='+',     // add argument to parse from command line  
                    help='Input Verilog files')        .parse()           Argument parsing done here      
xform = XForm(parser.verilogs)    xf_outputs =  []      Transformation task will go in this list for the outputs and then we print all items on console   //replace with your own transformation function     argv=['--file', 'input1','-e']          
for output in visitor_mapper(xform):        # invoke our custom visitors here         xf.accept()       call to visit method of XForm instance which is not defined yet, replace it by yours   //call the specific function for transformation tasks  Replace with your own task like count increment etc...
```    Here you can add more functionalities such as writing output file or printing on console based upon requirement. The above code should give a basic idea how to proceed and may need modifications according to project requirements, complexity level of transformations required等等..   For now it is unable handling Verilog ASTs which are needed for your task so that'll be one more work in future....
