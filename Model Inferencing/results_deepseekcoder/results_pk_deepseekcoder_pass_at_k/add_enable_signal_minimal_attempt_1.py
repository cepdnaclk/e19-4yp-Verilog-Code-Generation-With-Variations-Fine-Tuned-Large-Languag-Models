Sure, I can provide a basic structure for your request using Python and PyVerilog to parse Verilog/Systemverilog files and perform transformations on them. Please note that this is just an example of how you might approach it in practice; the actual implementation will depend heavily on what specific features or issues are required from xform framework such as support for different hardware, error handling etc.,

Firstly, install necessary libraries using pip:
```sh
pip install pyverilog re argparse  # add others if needed (like ast unittest)  
```   
The following is a simplified version of how you might start implementing this in Python. The code below will parse Verilog files and modify the counter based on an enable signal:

**main_xform.py : Main Transformation Function using PyVerilog to Parse Files, Apply Visitor Pattern for xforms & Modify Logic Based On Enable Signal (Optional) ** 
```python  
from pyverilog import parser as pvp    # Import the library and its functions    
import re      
# Add other necessary modules if needed.         
class CounterVisitor(object):       	# Define a Visiting pattern for xform     
	def __init__(self, enable_signal=False  ) :         self._enable = None    # Enable signal flag               
	@pvp('assign', lambda n: 'counter <= counter + 1;')  		     return True              if not isinstance(n.children[0], pvp.Id) or \               re_match=re.compile("^([a-zA-Z_\[]+)\s*<=\s*(.*);$")
	def visitAssign(__self, n):  # Assignment Visitor         def __init__( self , enable )     super(CounterVisitor.__name__   return False if not re_match.fullmatch (n) else True             pvp .replaceChild('assign', 'counter <= counter + 1;')
	def visitModule(__self, n):  # Module Visiting Pattern          def __init__( self , enable )     super(CounterVisitor.__name__   return False if not re_match.fullmatch (n) else True             pvp .replaceChild('assign', 'counter <= counter + 1;')
	# Add other visit methods as per the requirements of xform framework                def __init__(self, enable): pass     # Your implementation here                  ])   return False if not re_match.fullmatch (n) else True             pvp .replaceChild('assign', 'counter <= counter + 1;')
```    ****PyVerilog’s AST nodes are a bit abstract so it'll be hard for beginners to grasp what they actually represent.*  It requires you have some understanding of Python and the PyVerilog library. You can refer more about this at [https://pyverilog-ast.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.](PyVerilog’s AST)   
   ****Regex pattern for Counter Visitor: '^([a-zA-Z_]+)\s*<=\s*(.*);$'**     This is just a regex to match assignments where the left hand side of assignment matches with variable names and right part also has increment operation.  
    ****The enable signal flag (self._enable) will be set if an 'if not re_match...return False; elif ... return True.' block calls for modifying logic**  If it's None, we don’t do anything ie., no modification needed based on the given xform.
   ****The replaceChild method is used to modify AST nodes where necessary by replacing or adding new child node(s). This allows you can change counter increment as per your requirements**  The visitor pattern (Visitor) in PyVerilog provides a way of separating concerns and making the code more readable.
   ****You may need additional error handling/validations if there are any specific rules or conditions to be followed while parsing files, transforming them etc., I have not included that part due to space constraints**  This will also depend on whether you want a command-line interface with argparse for user inputs.
   ****Comprehensive docstrings and import statements in the code would make it easier for anyone reading your work (or someone else who wants/uses yours) understand what each part of this module is doing**  I hope that makes sense! Let me know if you have further questions or need more detailed explanations.
