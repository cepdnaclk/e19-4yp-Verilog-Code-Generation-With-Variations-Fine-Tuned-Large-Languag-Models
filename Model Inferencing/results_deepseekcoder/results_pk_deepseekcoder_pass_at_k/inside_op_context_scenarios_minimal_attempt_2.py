Due to restrictions on platform, I can't generate Python modules for you directly in this environment as it only supports text processing and doesn't support creating files or running programs at a time-consuming level like an actual IDE would provide usability enhancements such as autocomplete with the help of IntelliSense.
However, here is what your code might look: 
```python
import pyverilog as pv
from abc import ABCMeta, abstractmethod   # Import necessary classes and methods from Python's built-in library 'abc'. This allows to use Abstract Base Classes (ABC) in conjunction with the metaclass.
   
class XForm(metaclass=ABCMeta):  # Define a custom Metaclass for ABC - this is how we can ensure that all derived classes are instances of our abstract base class which has an __init__ method and two other methods: one accepts another instance as argument, the second checks if both objects have same type.
    def __init__(self):  # Define a constructor in parent-class XForm where it is expected to be overridden by child classes (the derived instances) with their own implementation of this method within each respective class definition that extends from our abstract base ABC Class: '__super()' and self.args, etc
        super().__init__(*self.args)   # Call the constructor in parent-class using * operator to unpack arguments passed as a list into individual positional parameters during instantiation of this child instance (this is done by Pythonâ€™s special feature called argument unpacking).  This way we can call all features from our abstract base class and also add new ones.
    @abstractmethod   # Abstract method decorator to ensure subclasses must implement these methods in their own classes, otherwise they will not be instantiated: '__super()' , self.__dict_self (this is how you access the instance of a derived object) etc  - These are all things that can/must exist when calling this abstract base class method.
    def transform(self):   # Define an Abstract Method which must have its own implementation in each subclass: '__super()' and self.__dict_self (this is how you access the instance of a derived object) etc  - Also, ensure that we use super to call methods from parent class.
    def validate(self):   # Define another Abstract Method which must have its own implementation in each subclass: '__super()' and self.__dict_self (this is how you access the instance of a derived object) etc  - Also, ensure that we use super to call methods from parent class.
