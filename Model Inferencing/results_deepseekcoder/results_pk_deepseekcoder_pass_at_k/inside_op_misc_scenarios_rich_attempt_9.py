Here is a Python module for your requirements using `pyverilog` and regex (for transformations).  This implementation assumes that you have already installed pyVerilog by running 'pip install PyVerilog'. If not, please do so first with the command "pip install PyVerilog". The code below should help to get started.

```python
import argparse
from re import sub as replacer  # For replacing patterns in text strings using regex
from pyverilog import parse_file   # You may need to change this if you're not on a Linux system or have access issues with PyVerilog module installation. This should be the command for installing it: pip install python-pyverilogen . Then use "import pv" in your script
from os.path import splitext   # For getting file extension and name without extention (e.g., 'test' from filename='example') 

class ExampleVisitor(object):    # Define visitor class with basic operations we need to perform on AST nodes that match our target signal names inside operator scenario as per requirement here: https://pyverilog-readthedocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/parsers_and_transformations/walking_ast_.html
    def __init__(self, signal):  # Initialize visitor with our target node name (signal) as a parameter    
        self._node = None   # Node we're currently visiting. Stored here so that other methods can easily access it if required later on by the `visit()` method   
       super(ExampleVisitor,self).__init__(arg=None , kwargs={})  # Call parent initializer with no arguments or keyword parameters   self._node = None     def visit ( node ) : pass                  @staticmethod         def get_childrens () -> List[Node]        return []
