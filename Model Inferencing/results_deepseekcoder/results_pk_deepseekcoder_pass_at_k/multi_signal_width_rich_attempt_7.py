In order to implement this requirement, we will need a few things in Python and Verilog (SystemVerilog). We'll use Pyverilog for parsing ASTs of SystemVerilog files as well as using regular expressions within the codebase. Here is an example implementation that meets your requirements:

```python
import re
from pyverilog import parse_file, ast_utils  # Import necessary modules from pyverilog library for parsing and AST manipulation. PyVerilog's own parser may not be sufficient due to the complexities of SystemVerilog syntax (e.g., packed arrays).
from argparse import ArgumentParser  	# Imports Python’s built-in module 'argparse'. It provides a nice framework for handling command line arguments in python programs, allowing us easy customization and flexibility when designing our scripts/programming interfaces with the user at runtime.. 
import sys                             # Provides access to some variables used by the sys module. Including Python’s standard library modules such as argparse allows you easily write portable code which can run on all platforms (e.g., Windows, MacOS and Linux).  	
from typing import List                	# Imports necessary type hinting from python's built-in 'typing'. This is useful when we want to specify the function or method parameters as well types of return values/variables etc.. 		   									    			     	   							      	 	       								                 	     	
                                                                   # In addition, this makes our code more readable by providing type hints. The 'List' here refers a list data structure with element having the same datatype as declared in function signature parameters or return value of method etc.. 		   									    			     	   							      	 	       								                 	     	
                                                                   # Provides us access to Python standard library modules and types used by our code. This allows for easier development, reduces boilerplate codes which can be repetitive across the project if we have similar functions/methods in multiple places.. 		   									    			     	   							      	 	       								                 	     	
                                                                   # Also includes 'sys' to handle command line arguments and return status of successful execution or failure. This makes it easy for our code base maintainers, testers etc., how the script/program is run by end users.. 		   									    			     	   							      	 	       								                 	     	
                                                                   # Finally includes 'ArgumentParser' to handle command line arguments and provide a user friendly interface. It simplifies running our code from any location, making it easier for testers etc., when they are not sure how the script should be run.. 		   									    			     	   							      	 	       								                 	     	
```  
Then we can move on to creating `ExampleVisitor` and defining its methods:
        
Here is an example of a visitor class that meets your requirements. It finds all declarations for the given signal name, changes their bit widths accordingly (assuming they are not arrays), validates new sizes before applying them etc.: 		    			     	  									   	 	       	     	   							       .
