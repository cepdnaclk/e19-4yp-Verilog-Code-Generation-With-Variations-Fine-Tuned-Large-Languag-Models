Here's a Python module for your requirement using PyVerilog and re (for regex operations). Please note that this is just an example, you might need to modify it based on actual requirements or constraints of Verilog/SystemVerilog codebase as well the AST structure. Also please ensure pyverilog has been installed correctly by running `pip install PyVerilog` in your terminal if not already done so and also run a test using command line like this:
```python
import argparse  # argument parser library for handling args from CLI  
from xform import ExampleVisitor, transform_example    # the visitor class that follows XFR pattern. Note it should be in same file or you need to update its path accordingly with your setup and current structure of code base    
```
The transformation module (called `xform` here) is a single script which accepts command line arguments for input, output files as well signal names: 
- i - Input File.  
- o - Output file during the operation .   
- s - Signal name to search in codebase and replace it with new value if found (required). Also supports multiple occurrences of this option which will be replaced by all matches that are encountered while parsing AST tree for `s`. 
```python  
def main():     # the entry point function   
        parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='PyVerilog XFR')     
         # command line arguments, here 'i', and also a required argument '-o'. The help of this is: python xform_module.py -h   which will display all the available options    
 	parser.add_argument('-i','--inputfile' , type=str)   
        parser.add_argument('-s', '--signalname')      # required argument for signal name to search and replace in verilog source code file, help is: python xform -h     which will display all available options  
 	parser.add_argument('-o','--outputfile' , type=str)   
        args = parser.parse_args()      # parse the arguments from command line to arg object 'arg'. In Python, everything is treated as an Object and you can access its properties using dot operator like `obj.property`  
 	transform_example(inputfile  = args.inputfile , outputfile= args .outputfile or inplace = True )     # call the transformation function with arguments passed from CLI   
```        You'll need to add more code for error handling, validations and other necessary functionalities based on your requirement such as:  testing XMR scenarios using different reference types etc.   This will be a comprehensive module that can serve you in fulfilling all the requirements mentioned above efficiently with an efficient way of implementing it according to provided patterns by PyVerilog library for parsing, visiting and transforming ASTs while also ensuring error handling mechanisms as well validation checks during transformations if required based on your application.
