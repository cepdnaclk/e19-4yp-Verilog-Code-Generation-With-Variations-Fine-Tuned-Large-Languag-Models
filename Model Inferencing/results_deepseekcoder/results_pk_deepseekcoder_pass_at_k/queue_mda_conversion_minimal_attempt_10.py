Here is a Python module for your requirement using PyVerilog, re (for regular expressions), argparse and ast(Python's standard library to parse Verilog or SystemVerilog).  This example assumes that you are working on verilog2sv which converts from an abstract syntax tree in the form of a ParseTree.
```python
import pyverilog as pv
from re import findall, DOTALL   # For regular expressions support and dot for substring matching 
import argparse               # To handle command-line arguments   
    
class XformVisitor(pv.XFormMatch):     
        """A visitor class that inherits the pattern from existing xforms."""        
                    
def convert_to_queue (verilogCode:str) -> str :  # Assuming verilog code is a string  
    '''Transform fixed arrays to queue-based multi dimensional arrays.'''    
     
    tree = pv.parse(filename, source=verilogCode).children()[0]      
        
if __name__ == '__main__':  # Command line interface       
          parser =  argparse.ArgumentParser (description  ='Convert fixed arrays to queue-based multi dimensional arrays')  
          
    '''Define commandline arguments'''    
      args = parser.add_argument('filename', type=str, help=  'Input verilog file name or code for transformation.' )  # File argument and its usage message         
        
        run(args)      
```   This is a very basic implementation of your requirement using PyVerilog's built-in XFormMatch. Depending on the complexity level required, you may need to extend this module significantly or build upon it in order for full functionality (i.e., handling multiple dimensions and unbounded/bound queues).
