Here's a Python module for your requirement using PyVerilog and re (for regex operations):

```python
import pyverilog as pv  # You need to install this library via pip, e.g., "pip install git+https://github.com/prboehm-dev/pyverilog" for latest version of PyVerilog package (0.34).12)
import re   // Importing the module 're' from Python standard libraries to use regex operations  in python code via its functions such as sub(), findall() etc which are provided by it and used here too.
import argparse    // This is a part of argument parsing for command-line interface, that you can call your script with arguments through the terminal/command line (you need to provide old_name & new name in addition or replace) – e.g., "python transform.py --file inputFile1.sv --signalName mySignal"
   # Define a main function for transformation operation, called from command-line interface:
def xform(inputFileNameSv , signalName):    // This is the new name of your file in .svg format after transformations – e.g., "transformedFile1.sv")
     try :      // Try...except block will catch any exceptions raised during execution and handle them gracefully, notifying user about issue if occurred:   --> Exceptions such as IOError or FileNotFoundException etc are handled here in Python using exception handling mechanism like the above one used for a function. 
          pv_file = open(inputFileNameSv , 'r')    // Open input file and read content into memory, then parse it:   --> We use PyVerilog parser (PyV) to generate AST from sv/verilog code which is an abstract syntax tree of the Verilog source.
          ast = pv_file .read()                    // Read parsed data back as string – e.g., "print('Hello, World!')" in verilog file will be read and converted into a python program/string via pyverigon parser (PyV).   --> Then we define visitor to find & replace signal name using regex:
          changes_made = []                             // This list is used for keeping track of all the modifications made by our transformer. – e.g., "Found mySignal" and so on in each iteration during visit method execution (during AST traversing).   --> Finally, if any change has been done successfully or not through visiting nodes then it will be returned as result:
          visitor = pv_visitor(signalName)              // Create a new instance of our custom Visitor. – e.g., "ExampleVisitor('mySignal')" and so on in each iteration during visit method execution (during AST traversing).   --> We are not using the visitor pattern here, just to simplify your task but it is possible based upon requirement
          changes_made = [item for item in re.findall(r'(\b%s\b)' % signalName , ast) if pv_visitor]  // Use regex operation (re module ) on AST data which finds all occurances of the old name and replace it with new one, then return a list including changes made:
          # Perform transformations here as per requirement. For instance in your case you can use re to find & substitute signals using substitution string ie., 'mySignal' --> Replace signal occurrence by replacing occurrences of the old name – e.g,, "content = content .replace(r, modified_version)"
          # Return result: True if no exceptions occurred otherwise False/Exception details in case an exception was thrown during execution (i.e., IOError or FileNotFound etc).   --> For instance you can use 'print' statement to print the changes made as well return a tuple of all modifications, whether successful and any error encountered while processing data:
          # If no exceptions occurred we simply returned True along with list containing operations performed (if there were): ['Found mySignal'] – e.g., "return result" in function definition would look like this -> 'def xform(inputFileNameSv , signalName) :' -->  return ('True', changes_made if len(changes_made)) or exception details otherwise (e.g.: ("False", str(exception)))
     except Exception as e:  // Except block is used to catch exceptions that occur during the execution of program and handle them in a controlled way -> In this case, we are catching all type of errors which can be occurred at runtime like any other exception based on requirement. Here 'e' variable contains information about error if there was an issue:
          return ('False', str(exception))    // If no exceptions were raised then simply returning False along with Exception details in a tuple format -> "return result" function definition would look as this – e.g.:   -->  def xform() :'-- >  'except (ValueError, IOError) exception: return ('False', str(exception))
```      // End of Python code for transforming signal name in verilog sv file using PyVerilog and re module or any other similar library. – e.g., "def xform() :'-->  'except (ValueError, IOError) exception: return ('False', str(exception))"
   // A command-line interface can be created by argparse to accept arguments -> For example you could create a function called main that accepts input file name and signalName as argument like this – e.g., "def main() :'-->  'args = parser .parse_args()" where the usage would look something similar: --> <py="main__" cols=30>if __name___==“____”!r
