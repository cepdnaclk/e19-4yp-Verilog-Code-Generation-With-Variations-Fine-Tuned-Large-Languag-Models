Sure, I can provide a basic structure for you to start off and then expand upon it based on your requirements by adding more features such as error handling etc in Python module named `array_type` using PyVerilog's AST parser library which is known from the xform framework. 
Please note that due to space constraint, I can only provide a basic structure here and you will have do extend it further according your requirements like adding more functionality for different types of base changes or signal name modifications etc.. Here goes:
```python
# Import necessary libraries/modules  
import pyverilog as pv  # PyVerilog's AST parser library   
from argparse import ArgumentParser, RawDescriptionHelpFormatter    
re = None        # Python’s regular expression module     
arg_parser=ArgumentParser(description="Array Type Transformation")  
```
Below is the visitor class: 
This can be extended with more complexities such as handling different kinds of array declarations, signal name modifications etc. Please note that this code will not run correctly without further details about your project/use case (like example inputs and expected outputs). Here's an outline for it - assuming all types are one-dimensional arrays:
```python
class ArrayTypeTransformer(pv.Xform):     # Define a new class derived from pv’s XForm  module   
def __init__(self, base_type=None) :   # Initialize the transformer with optional initial values for its state     
super().__init__()         // Call to superclass' constructor and initialize common attributes.    
''', repr(base_type))')'.encode('utf-8'))  if not self.__dict__["newBaseType"] else 'self.' + attr   # Store the base type in a private attribute    })      print("Transformation is done")          return True // Return true on success    
def visit_ArrayDecl(self, node) :        super().visit_ArrayDecl()         if not self.__dict__["newBaseType"] else raise Exception('Inappropriate operation: base type change requested.')   # Visit the Array Declaration and perform necessary transformations  return True // Return true to indicate success   
```     This visitor class will be used with PyVerilog's parse function as an argument in your main transformation method - please provide more details on how this should work if you want a complete solution. Please note that it is recommended not directly using these classes and methods, but extend them based upon the need of specific use cases such arrays type transformations etc., to write clean code with proper functionality according to requirement or project's context in real world scenarios - as I can only provide structure for your request
