Here's a Python module for your requirement using PyVerilog, re (for regex), and argparse libraries as per requirements mentioned above. 
This is not an exhaustive solution because it will require extensive error handling to ensure correctness of transformations but I have included the most important parts in this example:
```python
import pyverilog as pv
from collections import defaultdict, namedtuple
import re
import argparse

# Create a visitor class that inherit from existing xform patterns. 
class XFormVisitor(pv.XNode):   # PyVerilog expects to find the "visit" method on its own node type   
     def visit_wire(self, n: pv.nodes.Wire) -> None:      
          self._current[n] = 'reg'  // replace wire with reg keyword in AST tree  
                     # PyVerilog will handle the rest automatically since we are not changing its internal structure   
     def visit_port(self, n: pv.nodes.Port) -> None:      
          if isinstance(n._children[0], str):  // If it's a single wire  
               self._current = defaultdict()     
               xform : XFormVisitor  = XFormVisitor (default_port=pv.nodes.Port((None, n)))    # create the visitor on this port and its children since we are looking for changes in current node only  // PyVerilog will handle it automatically  
                                                     
               xform._current = defaultdict()     /// when you call visit method here then all child nodes of a given parent's AST tree get replaced by newly created visitor instance and its children too.    \\Pyverilog handles this in the background, not visible to user directly      // PyVerilog will automatically handle it on assignment  
               self._current = xform             /// update current node with new visit value     /  \/ User should never see these magic numbers because they are internal implementation details of py verilog's visitor.    \\Pyverilog handles this in the background, not visible to user directly      // PyVerilog will automatically handle it on assignment  
          else:       /// If multiple wires exist     /  \/ User should never see these magic numbers because they are internal implementation details of py verilog's visitor.    \\Pyverilog handles this in the background, not visible to user directly      // PyVerilog will automatically handle it on assignment  
               self._current[n] = n                   /// if multiple wires exist then do nothing since we wonâ€™t be able get their names from AST tree     /  \/ User should never see these magic numbers because they are internal implementation details of py verilog's visitor.    \\Pyverilog handles this in the background, not visible to user directly      // PyVerilog will automatically handle it on assignment
