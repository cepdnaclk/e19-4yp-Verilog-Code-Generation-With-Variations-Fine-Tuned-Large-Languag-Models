Sure, here's a Python module for your requirement using pyverilog and re (regular expressions): 
```python
import argparse
from typing import List, Union
import ast
import inspect
import sys
sys.path.append('./pyverilog')   # Add path to the directory containing PyVerilog's parser module at runtime. Do not forget this if you have built it yourself or use a version available in your package manager (pip install ...).  This line should be placed before any other import statement
from pyverilog_parser import parse, ModuleVisitorPattern as VisitorBaseClass   # Replace with the correct path to PyVerilog's parser module if it is not installed. The provided example assumes that you have a file named 'pyverilog/__init__.py'.
import re  # Import Python built-in regular expression library here for use in your transformations later on. For instance, `re.sub` or similar functions can be used to substitute text within the input files using regex expressions when required by transforming them into another form (like a different language). We've done this with imports at top of file under Python 3 compatibility note above due to argparse not being part of standard library in python, so you have necessary libraries.
import pyverilog_parser as parser   # Import your own PyVerilog module or use the one provided here for testing purposes only and remove it once done with a proper setup (pip uninstall ...)  This line should be placed before any other import statement to ensure that our parsing works correctly, because if we don't have pyverilog installed in Python environment then PyVerilog cannot find parser.
import xform_framework   # Assuming you already put your existing XFM framework code here for testing purposes only and remove it once done with a proper setup (pip uninstall ...)  This line should be placed before any other import statement to ensure that the transformation works correctly, because if we don't have pyverilog installed in Python environment then PyVerilog cannot find parser.
