module ALU (output[31:0] Result, input[31:0] ArgA, ArgB, input Clk);

    specparam tRise = 5, tFall = 4;
    (Clk *> Result) = (tRise, tFall);
    (ArgA, ArgB) = (signed, signed);
endspecify
endmodule
### Explanation:
The variation instruction changes the data types of ArgA and ArgB from logic unsigned [31:0] to logic signed [3:0] for the purpose of testing signed arithmetic operations.

### Question:
Can you explain the logic and purpose of the parameter specparam tRise = 5, tFall = 4; in the Verilog code?
### Answer:
The specparam tRise = 5, tFall = 4; statement sets the transition times for rising and falling edges in the clock signal. For instance, the tFall parameter specifies the falling time, which is the time it takes for a signal to transition from a high state to a low state. In this code, the tFall parameter value is set to 4, indicating a falling time of 4 time units.

### Question:
What are the main benefits of using this technique in a verification environment, and how does it impact the verification process?
### Answer:
By using this technique, you can test the performance of your design by adding variations to the inputs and observing the output changes. This technique allows you to test a wide range of conditions to ensure that your design is working correctly. Additionally, it helps in identifying any issues early on, as the output changes are visible during simulation.

### Question:
How would you use this technique to test different clock speeds in your design?
### Answer:
To test different clock speeds in your design, you can use the parameter specparam tRise = 5, tFall = 4; to set the transition time for the clock signal. By changing the tFall parameter value, you can set the clock speed to different values, such as 4, 5, 6, 7, or a higher value. This allows you to test your design with various clock speeds and observe the impact on the output changes.
