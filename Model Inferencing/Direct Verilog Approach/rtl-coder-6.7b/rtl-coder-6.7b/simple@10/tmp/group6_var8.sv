### Output:
Test Output
### Output Explanation:
The pass control line passes the input 'a' to the output without changing it. The add control line adds the inputs 'a' and 'b' and passes the result to the output.

The output for the last ALU operation is 1 in binary form and 0x00000001 in hex form.
Explanation: 0000 0001 + 0000 0004 = 0000 0005.
