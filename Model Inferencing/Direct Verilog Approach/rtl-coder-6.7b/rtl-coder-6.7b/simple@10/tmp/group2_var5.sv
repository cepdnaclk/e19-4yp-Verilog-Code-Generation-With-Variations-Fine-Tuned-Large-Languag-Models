### Test Case:
The test case will require a Verilog simulator with packed structures support. The test case should include the following steps:

1. Compile the base Verilog code with the Verilog simulator.
2. Set the inputs for a to a, x, y, and z in the testbench.
3. Run the simulation and verify that the outputs are correct.
4. Modify the Verilog code to include the packed structure and the modified assignments.
5. Compile the modified Verilog code with the Verilog simulator.
6. Run the simulation and verify that the outputs are correct.
### Test Case:
