### Results:
| Test | Error |
| ---- | ----- |
| DFF | Pass |

### Explanation
The code uses the union data type to represent input a and b as either 1'b0 or 1'b1. The output y is then assigned the result of the and operation between a and b. The code passes the verification because the union type is supported in Verilog-AMS and the and operation can be performed on union types.

### Code Analysis:
The code uses the union data type to represent input a and b as either 1'b0 or 1'b1. The output y is then assigned the result of the and operation between a and b. The code passes the verification because the union type is supported in Verilog-AMS and the and operation can be performed on union types.
