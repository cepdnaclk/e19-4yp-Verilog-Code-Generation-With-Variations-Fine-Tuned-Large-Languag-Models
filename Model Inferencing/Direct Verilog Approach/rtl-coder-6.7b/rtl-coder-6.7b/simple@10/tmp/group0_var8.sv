// Create a module with one input and one output that behaves like a wire
module wire_assign( input bit in, output out );
    // assign out to in
    assign out = in;
endmodule

### Changes:
- The input `in` was changed from type `wire` to `bit`
- The output `out` was changed from type `wire` to `output`

### Output:
- The module `wire_assign` now behaves like a wire (i.e. the output is always equal to the input).
