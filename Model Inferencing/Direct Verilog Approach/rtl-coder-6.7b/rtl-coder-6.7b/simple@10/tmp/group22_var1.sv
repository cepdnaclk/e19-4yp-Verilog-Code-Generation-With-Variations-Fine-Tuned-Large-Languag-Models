```verilog
typedef struct packed {
logic x1;
logic x2;
logic x3;
logic x4;
} input_t;
```
```verilog
input_t in;
output parity, all_ones;
assign parity = ^in;
assign all_ones = &in;
endmodule
```
### Correct Answers:
a. The compiler will infer the logic type and will generate a warning that the packed struct can be packed into a packed logic type.

b. The compiler will infer the logic type and will generate a warning that the unpacked struct can be unpacked into a logic type.

**Correct Answer: a.**
### Explanation:
Because logic variables and packed logic variables are 1 bit, unpacked structs can be unpacked into a logic type and packed structs can be packed into a packed logic type. With these constraints in mind, it's clear that option **a** provides the most efficient way to implement the code and option **b** would be inefficient for this specific task.

### Additional Correct Answers:
a. The compiler will infer the logic type and will generate a warning that the packed struct can be packed into a packed logic type.

c. The compiler will infer the logic type and will generate a warning that the unpacked struct can be unpacked into a logic type.
