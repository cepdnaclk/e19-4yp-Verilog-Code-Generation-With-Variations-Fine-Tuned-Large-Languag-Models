// Create a module with one input and one output that behaves like a wire
module wire_assign( bit in, output out );
    // assign out to in
    assign out = in;
endmodule
### Results:
In this variation, the type of the input wire in was changed to a bit type. The SystemVerilog bit datatype can be used to represent a single bit of data, with values 0 or 1. In this case, the input wire in is assigned to the output wire out using the bit datatype.

In summary, the modified code in the SystemVerilog variation uses the bit datatype to represent a single bit of data as an input to the module. The behavior of the module remains unchanged, but the input is now represented as a single bit instead of a wire.
