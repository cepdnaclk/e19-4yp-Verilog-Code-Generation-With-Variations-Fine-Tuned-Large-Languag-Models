// Verilog code for Problem 5
module Half_Adder(
    input logic A, B,
    output logic [7:0] Sum, Carry
);
    assign Sum = A ^ B;
    assign Carry = A & B;
endmodule
#### Explanation:
The output type has been changed from reg to logic [7:0] to align with modern signal declarations. The [7:0] indicates that the output is a 8-bit wide signal, which aligns with the expected output type in the SystemVerilog code. This modification ensures that the output type is correctly specified and aligns with the expected functionality of the code.
