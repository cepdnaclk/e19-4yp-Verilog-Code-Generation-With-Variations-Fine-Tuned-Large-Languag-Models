### Additional Information:
1. Generate construct can be used to instantiate multiple instances of the same module in a single cell, which is a method for reducing the number of cells required.
2. This method is useful when the module is used in a complex hierarchical design that is difficult to analyze.
3. Generate construct can also be used to parameterize the module instantiation in a hierarchical design, which is a method for reducing the number of cells required.
