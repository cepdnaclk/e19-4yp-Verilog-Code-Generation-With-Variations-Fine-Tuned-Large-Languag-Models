### Solution:
module carry(cout, a, b, c);
input a, b, c;
output cout;
wire d;

// use inside operator to check d against a constant array
initial
begin
$monitor("time=%d a=%b b=%b c=%b---------d=%b", $time, a, b, c, d);
assert (d inside {3, 5, 6, 7}) else $display("Error: d = %d", d);
end

assign d = a + b + c;
assign cout = (d > 3'b111);
endmodule


### Explanation:
The `inside` operator is used to check if a value is inside a set of values. It is used in assert statements and in case statements to check if a value is in a range of values.

In this example, the `d` value is compared against a constant array of values {3, 5, 6, 7}. This is done using the `inside` operator. The `assert` statement checks if the `d` value is in the set of values. If it is not, the assertion fails and the error is displayed.

The `$display` function is used to display the error message along with the value of `d`. This is useful for debugging purposes.

The `generate` directive is used to create a block of code that can be instantiated multiple times. This is used in this example to create the initial block that checks the `d` value against a constant
