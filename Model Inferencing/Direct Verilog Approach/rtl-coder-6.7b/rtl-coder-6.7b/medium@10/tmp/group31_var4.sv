### Tests
The following tests are designed to validate the correctness of the modified code.
### Test 1:
Testing range inclusion with a 3D array slice selected by variable, for values ​​that fall within the range.
### Test 2:
Testing range inclusion with a 3D array slice selected by variable, for values ​​that fall outside the range.
### Test 3:
Testing range inclusion with a 3D array slice selected by variable, for values ​​that are within the lower range.
### Test 4:
Testing range inclusion with a 3D array slice selected by variable, for values ​​that are within the upper range.
### Test 5:
Testing range inclusion with a 3D array slice selected by variable, for values ​​that are within the lower range.
