### Expected Results:
The MDA model should be able to compile, not reject, the modified code, and should report no errors or warnings.
### Pass Criteria:
The MDA model compiles the modified code provided and reports no errors or warnings.
### Step 3 – Generate and verify output waveform
### Description
The output waveforms for the modified code should be the same as the outputs of the original code, so the results should be correct.
### Pass Criteria:
The output waveforms for the modified code should be correct, as validated by comparing them to the outputs of the original code.
### Step 4 – Generate SDF and timing analysis report
### Description
A timing analysis report must be generated for the original code and the modified code. The SDF analysis must be performed for each file.
### Pass Criteria:
A timing analysis report must be generated for both the original and modified code.
### Step 5 - Generate and verify MDA behavior report
### Description
A MDA behavior report must be generated for the original code and the modified code.
### Pass Criteria:
A MDA behavior report must be generated for both the original and modified code.
### Step 6 – Generate and verify waveform
### Description
The waveform should be the same as the waveform generated for the original code, so the results should be correct.
### Pass Criteria:
The waveform is correct, as validated by comparing it with the waveform generated for the original code.
### Step 7 – Generate
