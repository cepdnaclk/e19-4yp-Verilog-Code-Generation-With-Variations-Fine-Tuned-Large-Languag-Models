### Modified Code Description:
The modified code is using a packed vector array of the register vector with $[2:5] representing the 5th to the 2nd element of the register, $[6:7] representing the 7th element to the 6th element of the register, and $[1:4] representing the 4th element to the 1st element of the register to create a dynamic range list.  The case statement matching the dynamic range list against the m signal is successful.
