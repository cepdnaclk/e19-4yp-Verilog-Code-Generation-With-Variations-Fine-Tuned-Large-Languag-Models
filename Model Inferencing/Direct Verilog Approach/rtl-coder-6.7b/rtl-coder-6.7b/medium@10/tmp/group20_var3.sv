### Change Summary:
Changed assignment from inside final block to procedural assignment within final block.
### Explanation:
In this modified code, a procedural assignment within the final block is used, which increments the Count signal by 1 every clock cycle and then resets it to 0 if the Reset signal is asserted. The procedural assignment is placed after the Count signal is incremented, and the if statement is placed before the Count signal is incremented. This ensures that the Count signal is reset to 0 only if the Reset signal is asserted, and that the Count signal is incremented every clock cycle, regardless of the value of the Reset signal.
