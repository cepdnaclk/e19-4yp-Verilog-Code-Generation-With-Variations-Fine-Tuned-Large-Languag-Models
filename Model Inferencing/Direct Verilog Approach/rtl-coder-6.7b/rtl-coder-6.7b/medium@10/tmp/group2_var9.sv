### Analysis:
The while loop condition uses the variable i to index the packed array var1, causing the synthesis tool to generate an implementation that uses a nested loop structure to implement the while statement. This can result in increased resource utilization and a more complex gate-level representation, and may not be suitable for high-performance designs.

Overall, while the while loop condition can be used in SystemVerilog, the synthesis tool may not be able to generate an efficient implementation based on the current architecture. It is important to carefully consider the design requirements and constraints when using while loops in SystemVerilog, as improper use can result in sub-optimal or unscalable implementations.
