### Analysis:
The module dff is a basic D-flip flop that has an input di of one bit, and an output do of one bit. The module is behavioral and uses a procedural assignment to assign the input di to the output do on the negative clock edge. The initial block is used to initialize the output do to 1'b0.

The case statement is used to modify the value of do. The case statement is in a begin-end block, and the case statement is using a constant 1'b1 as the expression in the case statement. The case statement has a single case item, which is a list of two statements. The first statement is a procedural assignment to the output do. The second statement is a sequential assignment to the output do. The sequential assignment is using a procedural assignment to assign the input di to the output do.

The procedural assignment to the output do is using the non-blocking assignment operator <=. The non-blocking assignment operator is used to assign the input di to the output do in a single clock cycle. The non-blocking assignment operator is used because it is an asynchronous assignment. The async assignment occurs on the negative clock edge.
### Modified Testbench Code:
module tb(d,di,clk); // Test bench for D Flip-Flop
output [1:0] d;
input di,clk;
reg [1:0] d; // Initial value is 2'b00
initial
begin
d[1]=1'b0;
#10;
d[1]=1'b1;
#10;
d[1]=1'b0;
