The tool will find an issue with the modified code for the following reasons:
1.	In the initial block of the reg4 module, the 64'd15419 initialization is an illegal constant.
2.	Unlike the initial block in the reg4 module in the AMSuite example, the always block in the reg4 module in the AMSuite example does not include a condition for posedge Clock. 
3.	In the initial block of the reg4 module, a 64'd15419 initialization is specified for the i variable.
4.	In the always block of the reg4 module in the AMSuite example, the i variable is used as a dynamic array index, but the i variable is not declared as a 64-bit variable.
