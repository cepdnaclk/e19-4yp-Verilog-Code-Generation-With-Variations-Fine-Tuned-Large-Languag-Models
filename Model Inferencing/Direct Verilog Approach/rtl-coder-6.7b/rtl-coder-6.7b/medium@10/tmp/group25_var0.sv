### Difference:
The statement in original code is executed sequentially.
However, using case expression changes the execution order.
With this variation, the statement in the original code is not executed.
Instead, it is executed sequentially (like a signal assignment but the statement is in a case expression).
## 4 Verilog
### Base Verilog Code:
module example7_7(x, Clock, f, g);
input x, Clock;
output f, g;
reg f, g;
always @(posedge Clock)
begin
    f = x;
    g = x;
end
endmodule
### Variation Instruction:
Add inside in a case expression using an array element selected via
