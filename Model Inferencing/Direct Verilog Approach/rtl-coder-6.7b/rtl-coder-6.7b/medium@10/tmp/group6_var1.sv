### Variation Description:
It is possible to use a forever loop to generate a clock signal. The clock rate is determined by the time period between each clock cycle. The time period is calculated as the inverse of the clock frequency. The clock frequency is related to the clock period by the formula: Frequency = (Time Period * Frequency). The faster the clock frequency, the shorter the time period. The slower the clock frequency, the longer the time period.
### Variant Explanations:
1. Use a for loop that includes an inside expression where the index is calculated via a function call.
This variation of the code uses a for loop to generate the clock signal. The inside expression calculates the index used for the loop iteration. The index is used to determine the
