### Expected Output:
Verilog Code Simulation
The base code is a module that detects parity (the number of set bits) and reports if all bits are set.

The base code has four inputs x1, x2, x3, x4. Applying the structure operation to generate a single data structure with the same four bits of the inputs results in a 4-bit unpacked struct that has x1, x2, x3, x4 fields. You can then use the bitwise operators with the struct members.

The base code has three outputs, parity, all_ones, and one input, in.

The base code initializes parity and all_ones to zero.

The base code defines par_val as a 4-bit packed struct with the same four members as the input.

The base code performs an assignment in = in, which is converting the input into the par_val data structure.

The base code performs an assignment parity = ^v, which is applying the bitwise XOR operator to the structure. The XOR operator finds out if the number of set bits is odd or even.

The base code performs an assignment all_ones = &v, which is applying the bitwise AND operator to the structure. The bitwise AND operation with all ones produces 1 if all the bits are set and 0 otherwise.

The base code has no sensitivity list. That means the code is combinational; the code does not have any registers.

The results of the code are shown here:
