```
module alu_4(integer d,logic co,integer a,integer b,integer f,logic cci);
```
### Variation Instruction:
Examine the code and note the following:
- The declarations inside the always block are not in a scope.
- The carry-out co is defined outside the always block.
- The datatypes integer and logic are used instead of wire and reg respectively.
- The always block is used, instead of the initial block.
When the Verilog 2001 version of the code is executed, it should produce the following output:
### Output:
```
030: f =00, a=00,b =00,cci =0,d =00,co=0
060: f =01, a=01,b =01,cci =0,d =00,co=0
090: f =01, a=07,b =03,cci =0,d =04,co=0
120: f =10, a=0f,b =07,cci =0,d =07,co=1
150: f =10, a=0f,b =07,cci =1,d =8f,co=0
180: f =11, a=0f,b =07,cci =0,d =8f,co=0
210: f =11, a=0f,b =07,cci =1,d =ff,co=0
```
### Verilog 2001 Advantages:
- Verilog 2001 is a new version of Verilog 1995 that implements the IEEE 1364 standard.
- Verilog 2001 is more concise.
- Verilog 2001 uses a simpler syntax.
