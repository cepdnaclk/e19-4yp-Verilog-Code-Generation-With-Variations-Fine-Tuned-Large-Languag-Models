### Output:

### Explanation:
The Problem8 module takes two four-bit inputs a and b, and produces an output diff. The module is designed to subtract the two inputs, using a packed structure with three bits {x, y, z} to store the result of the subtraction.

Inside the module, two packed structures my_struct_t are created. One my_struct_t is assigned the value of a, and the other is assigned the value of b, followed by using a cast operator to convert b's value to my_struct_t.

The output diff is assigned the value of a + b, where the addition operator has been overloaded to perform bitwise addition on my_struct_t values. This is equivalent to adding the bits of a and b together, and storing the result in the diff packed structure.

When running the simulation using the modified code, the output diff should be equal to the result of subtracting b from a.
