module ALU ( input [7:0] a, b, input pass, add,
output logic[7:0] alu_out );
// Simple combinational ALU
always @(a or b or pass or add)
if (pass) alu_out = a;       // Pass input 'a'
else if (add) alu_out = a + b; // Add inputs 'a' and 'b'
else alu_out = 0;           // Default output is 0
endmodule
### Summary:

### 1. The code initializes a 7-bit signal named alu_out at 0.

### 2. The always block runs every time the inputs change.

### 3. The code first checks if the pass is asserted and sets the alu_out to the input a.

### 4. Second, the block checks if the add is asserted and sets the alu_out to the input a + b.

### 5. If neither pass or add are asserted, then the default value of 0 is used.

### 6. The logic and reg types are the same except that reg is a hardware register, which means it holds on the value until a new one is set.

### 7. Logic is a type that is used for combinational logic.

### 8. The reg type is used for storing data over time.

### 9. The output type can be changed to logic, reg, or wire.
