### Solution to Problem:
After instantiating the above testbench.
In the ha_9 module, a change was made to ca and s outputs to be packed structures.
When the HA module is instansiated in the testbench, a change was made to use the packed structure.
### Error Message:
Error:

./rtl/ha_9.v:1: Syntax error at 'wire'

### Solution to Error Message:
After looking at the ha_9 module error message, it was easily identified that the output ports did not have a port identifier.
A change was made to the module declaration to use a port identifier for the ca, s.
### Error Message:
Error:

./tb/tstha_9.v:11: Syntax error at '}'
