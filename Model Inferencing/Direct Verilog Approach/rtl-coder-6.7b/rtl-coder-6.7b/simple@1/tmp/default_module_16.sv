## Explanation:
The OR_FR_RL module has a parameter NUM_FR_RL, which is set to a value of 20. This parameter is used in the initial block of the module to specify the number of force/release pairs to be applied to the DataOut output.

Inside the initial block, a string str_list[2] is declared. str_list is an array of strings with two elements. The first element of the array is set to "force" and the second element is set to "release".

The for loop iterates over the values from 0 to NUM_FR_RL-1. For each iteration, a random number is generated between 0 and 1. If the generated number is 0, the force statement is executed with a random value for DataOut. If the generated number is 1, the release statement is executed, which removes any force or release statements from the DataOut output.

The force and release statements are displayed using the $display function. The force statement takes an argument of a random string with 32 bits. This string is displayed along with the message "force" to indicate that the force statement is being applied to the DataOut output. The release statement is displayed using the same format as the force statement, but with the message "release" to indicate that the release statement is being applied to the DataOut output.

The force and release statements are applied using the force and release statements in SystemVerilog. The force statement forces a specific value to the DataOut output for a fixed number of time units. The release statement removes any force or release statements from the DataOut output.

In this example, the force and release statements are applied to the DataOut output using the force and release statements in SystemVerilog. The force statement forces a random value to the DataOut output for 25 milliseconds, and the release statement removes any force or release statements from the DataOut output for 25 milliseconds. The force and release statements are applied using the force and release statements in SystemVerilog.
