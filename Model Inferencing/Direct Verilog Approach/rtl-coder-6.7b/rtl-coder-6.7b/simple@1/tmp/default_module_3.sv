module full_adder(i1, i2, cin, sum, cout);
input i1, i2, cin;
output sum, logic cout;
assign sum = i1 ^ i2 ^ cin;
assign cout = (i1 & i2) | (cin & (i1 | i2));
endmodule
### Observed Output:
sum = x
cout = 1
### Explanation:
This is because the type of cout is logic, which can be either logic value 1 or 0. When the value assigned to cout is not 1 or 0, the simulator is unable to map the value to a logic wire.
### Reason for failure:
The type of cout should be wire, and the value should be either 1 or 0. If the value assigned to cout is not 1 or 0, the simulator will not be able to map the value to a wire and therefore the output will be undefined.
