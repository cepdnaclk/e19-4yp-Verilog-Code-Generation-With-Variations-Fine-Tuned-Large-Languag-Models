module test;
typedef struct packed {
    wire a;
    reg x;
    reg y;
    reg z;
} test_t;
test_t t;
assign #25 t.a = 1;
always begin
    t.x = #10 t.a;
end
endmodule
### Results:
In this variation, the reg signals are now declared within a packed structure, and the assignments to x, y, and z are modified to use the packed structure's signals. This change should result in a similar output to the original code.
