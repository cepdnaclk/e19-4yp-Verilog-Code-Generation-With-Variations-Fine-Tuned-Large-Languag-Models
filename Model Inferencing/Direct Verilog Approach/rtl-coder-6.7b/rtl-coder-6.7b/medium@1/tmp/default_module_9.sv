### Explanation:
Correcting this code fixes the error. To fix this error, we need to use inside with an array-slice range in a logic-vector array.
### Results:
In this code, we use inside with an array-slice range to access a bit inside the signal I. This causes the error as only a single bit can be accessed, so the second bit of the array index is ignored.
