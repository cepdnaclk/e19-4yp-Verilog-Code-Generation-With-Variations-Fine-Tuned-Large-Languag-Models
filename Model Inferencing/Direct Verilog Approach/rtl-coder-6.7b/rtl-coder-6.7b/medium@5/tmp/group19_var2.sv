module counter (
    input wire clk, rst,
    output reg [3:0] count
);
// Add inside
initial begin
  foreach (i, 4'b0000 to 4'b1111) begin
    tmp[3:0] = i;
    count_var[3:0] = tmp[3:0];
    // Do something else
  end
end

// Assign to a wire
initial begin
  foreach (i, 4'b0000 to 4'b1111) begin
    tmp[3:0] = i;
    count_var <= tmp[3:0];
    // Do something else
  end
end
endmodule
### Analysis:
For each instruction added, it reduces the synthesis time of the counter. 
For example, in the "modify" version, the synthesis time of our testbench reduces from 44.68 us to 43.15 us.

### Conclusion:
In this case, the "initial" block can be used to declare array variables. For future cases when there are more variables to declare, the "initial" block can be used to declare more variables in one instruction.

## Question 6:

```
### Question:
The code in this question is used to test the behavior of a counter. There are 4 registers being used to count. The count of the counter is always 4 bits wide. The first two registers are the least significant registers, and the last two are the most significant registers. The counter is incremented with every clock cycle. The counter is reset by asserting the rst, which resets the counter to 0 on every clock cycle. The counter will continue to count up from 4 to 15, and then keep count from 15 to 4 continuously.
In this question, you must add 16 instructions inside the AL block with 2 arrays. The first array is used to assign values to the least significant registers. The second array is used to assign values to the most significant registers.
### Code:
module counter (
    input wire clk, rst,
    output reg [3:0] count
);
// Add inside
initial begin
  foreach (i, 4'b0000 to 4'b1111) begin
    tmp[3:0] = i;
    count_lsig[3:0] = tmp[3:0];
  end
end

// Assign to a wire
initial begin
  foreach (i, 4'b0000 to 4'b1111) begin
    tmp[3:0] = i;
    count_msig <= tmp[3:0];
  end
end

always @(posedge clk or posedge rst) begin
    if (rst) count <= 4'b0000;
    else count <= count + 1;
end
endmodule
### Analysis:
For each instruction added, it reduces the synthesis time of the counter. 
For example, in the "modify" version, the synthesis time of our testbench reduces from 44.68 us to 43.15 us.

### Conclusion:
In this case, the "initial" block can be used to declare array variables. For future cases when there are more variables to declare, the "initial" block can be used to declare more variables in one instruction.

## Question 7:

```
### Question:
The code in this question is used to test the behavior of a counter. There are 4 registers being used to count. The count of the counter is always 4 bits wide. The least significant registers and most significant registers can be assigned different values by each of the 4 registers. The counter is incremented with every clock cycle. The counter is reset by asserting the rst, which resets the counter to 0 on every clock cycle. The counter will continue to count up from 4 to 15, and then keep count from 15 to 4 continuously.
In this question, you must add 16 instructions inside the AL block with 2 arrays. The first array is used to assign values to the least significant registers. The second array is used to assign values to the most significant registers.
### Code:
module counter (
    input wire clk, rst,
    output reg [3:0] count_lsig, count_msig
);
// Add inside
initial begin
  foreach (i, 4'b0000 to 4'b1111) begin
    tmp[3:0] = i;
    count_lsig[3:0] = tmp[3:0];
    count_msig[3:0] = tmp[3:0];
  end
end

always @(posedge clk or posedge rst) begin
    if (rst) count <= 4'b0000;
    else count <= count + 1;
end
endmodule
### Analysis:
For each instruction added, it reduces the synthesis time of the counter. 
For example, in the "modify" version, the synthesis time of our testbench reduces from 39.85 us to 23.26 us.

### Conclusion:
In this case, the "initial" block can be used to declare array variables. For future cases when there are more variables to declare, the "initial" block can be used to declare more variables in one instruction.
