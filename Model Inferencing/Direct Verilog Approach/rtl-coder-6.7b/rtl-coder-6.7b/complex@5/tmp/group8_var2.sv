### Code Explanation:
The code is a Johnson counter that outputs a counter that increments and decrements in binary. It has an enable input that enables the counter to increment and decrement when high. It also has a clock input that increments the count on the rising edge of the clock. It also has a reset input that resets the count to 0 when high.

The Johnson counter is implemented using a `generate` block to wrap the Johnson counter logic. The `if (1) begin : G_NAME` statement is used to generate code.

The `generate` block also has a `begin : G_NAME` statement that is used to name the block.

The Johnson counter logic is implemented inside the `if (1) begin : G_NAME` statement.

The Johnson counter logic is implemented using a `case` statement that switches on the value of `count`. The `case` statement has 14 cases that increment and decrement the counter based on the value of `count`.

The `case` statement also has a `default` case that resets the counter to 0.

The Johnson counter logic is implemented using a `always` block that updates the counter on the rising edge of the clock or on the rising edge of the reset signal.

The Johnson counter logic is implemented using a `if (reset)` statement that resets the counter to 0 when the reset signal is high.

The Johnson counter logic is implemented using a `if (enable)` statement that increments and decrements the counter when the enable signal is high.

The Johnson counter logic is implemented using a `case (count)` statement that switches on the value of `count`. The `case (count)` statement has 14 cases that increment and decrement the counter based on the value of `count`.

The Johnson counter logic is implemented using a `assign` statement that assigns the value of `count` to the output of the Johnson counter.

The Johnson counter logic is implemented using a `begin` and `end` statement that delimit the code that is inside the `generate` block.

The `generate` block is used to wrap the Johnson counter logic.

The `generate` block also has a `begin : G_NAME` statement that is used to name the block.

The Johnson counter logic is implemented inside the `if (1) begin : G_NAME` statement.

The Johnson counter logic is implemented using a `case (count)` statement that switches on the value of `count`. The `case (count)` statement has 14 cases that increment and decrement the counter based on the value of `count`.
