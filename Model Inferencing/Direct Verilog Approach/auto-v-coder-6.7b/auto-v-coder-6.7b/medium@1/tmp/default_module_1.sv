This code remains unchanged as there's no need for any changes in functionality, as the base verilog code provided is already a 4-to-1 multiplexer with 4 input vectors and 1 output vector. If you are looking for another variation, please specify what you want to achieve.### 

### Base Verilog Code:

```
timescale 1ns/100ps

module ShiftRegister8 (input sl, sr, clk, input [7:0] ParIn, input [1:0] m, output reg [7:0] ParOut);
always @(negedge clk) begin
    case (m)
        0: ParOut <= ParOut;
        1: ParOut <= {sl, ParOut[7:1]};
        2: ParOut <= {ParOut[6:0], sr};
        3: ParOut <= ParIn;
        default: ParOut <= 8'bX;
    endcase
end
endmodule
```
This is a simple implementation of a 4-to-1 multiplexer with 4 input vectors and 1 output vector. The output of the multiplexer depends on the value of the'm' input, with'm' selecting one of the four input vectors. The 'clk' input is used as the clock signal, and the 'ParOut' output vector is updated on the negative edge of the clock.

The multiplexer works as follows:
- If'm' is 0, the output vector 'ParOut' is unchanged.
- If'm' is 1, the output vector '
