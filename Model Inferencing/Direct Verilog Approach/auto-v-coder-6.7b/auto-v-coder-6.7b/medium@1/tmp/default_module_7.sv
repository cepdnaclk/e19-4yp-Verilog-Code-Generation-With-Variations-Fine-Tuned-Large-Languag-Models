### Explanation:
This modified code adds an initial block that simulates checking the output with various input values over an array as a whole range. It will display the output value at each step of the simulation. 

Please note that, in this code, "in" is an array representing all possible binary combinations of i1 and i2. The for-loop iterates over every possible combination, waiting for a delay of 100ns at each step. It then checks the output value at each step and displays a message indicating whether the output is 1, 0, or X.

The "in" array is not declared anywhere in the original code, but it's assumed to be an array with binary values representing the possible combinations of i1 and i2. This modification is a simple demonstration and may need to be adjusted depending on the specifics of the target design or the specific simulation environment in use. For example, in a real design, "in" might be a list of input vectors obtained from a specific testbench or stimulus generator. In a simulation using Verilog,
