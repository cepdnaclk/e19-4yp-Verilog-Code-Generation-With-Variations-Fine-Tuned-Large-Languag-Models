```verilog
module tst_CMOSsw1();
  reg in,con; wire out;
  CMOSsw1 cmsw(out,in,con); // Instantiate CMOS switch
  initial begin in=1'b0; con=1'b1; end // Start enabled
  always #5 in =~in; // Toggle data
  always #3 con=~con; // Toggle control
  initial $monitor($time, "in = %b, con = %b, output = %b ",in,con,out);
  initial #20 $stop; // Stop simulation
  final $display("in = %b, con = %b, output = %b ",in,con,out);
endmodule
```
In this modified code, the `final` block is used to check the output of the CMOS switch at the end of the simulation. This is useful to verify that the expected behaviour of the CMOS switch given the input and control signals is being correctly implemented.

Please replace `in`, `con` and `out` with your own variable names and replace `CMOSsw1` with your actual switch module name.

The `final $display` command allows you to display the value of `in`, `con`, and `out` after the end of the simulation, allowing you to check the final state of the CMOS switch.This modified code will work if the CMOS switch does not have any combinational loops or delays. If the CMOS switch has delays or combinational loops, the `final` block might not display the correct output since its execution order is not determined until all other processes are completed. In such cases, using an `initial` block after the simulation stopping command as a workaround may be considered.This code is meant for educational purposes to understand Verilog's `final` block and how it can be used to test the final state of a circuit. A final block is executed after all other processes are finished, which is equivalent to `final $display`. Please ensure your design actually works as expected before using this code in a real-world application.```verilog
