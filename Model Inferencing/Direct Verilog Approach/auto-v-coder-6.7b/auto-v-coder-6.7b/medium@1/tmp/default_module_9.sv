```verilog
module pulses; // Corrected pulse generation attempt
  reg [8:0] I;
  reg b;
  initial
    while (I<100) begin // Loop based on integer I
      b = I[2]; // Assign bit 2 of I to b
      I = I + 1; // Increment I
    end
  initial I=0; // Initialize I
  initial #100 $stop; // Stop simulation
endmodule
```
In the original code, `b = I[1];` should have been `b = I[2];` because the bit position `1` of a nine-bit binary number is the second bit from the left, starting at `0`, and the bit position `2` is again the second bit from the left. Adjusting the bit position to `2` avoids the bit-indexing mistake.

Furthermore, due to the size of the I register being 9 bits, the bit positions are correct as well. 

Note: The testbench simulation will continue to run forever for this code as the `$stop` simulation command is not given an argument, which makes it indefinitely stop the simulation. So, it will essentially never end as there's no input to stop the simulation.

To fix this, you can either add a condition to stop the simulation when certain conditions are met (e.g., `if(b == 0) $stop;`) or increase the simulation time. In this case, it's clear that the `I` register will never reach `100`, so there's no need to loop for `100` I's. #100 can be replaced by any actual simulation duration as per your requirement.

In conclusion, the corrected code is as follows:

```verilog
module pulses; // Corrected pulse generation attempt
  reg [8:0] I;
  reg b;
  initial begin
    while (I<100) begin // Loop based on integer I
      b = I[2]; // Assign bit 2 of I to b
      I = I + 1; // Increment I
    end
    I=0; // Initialize I
    #100 $stop; // Stop simulation after 10
