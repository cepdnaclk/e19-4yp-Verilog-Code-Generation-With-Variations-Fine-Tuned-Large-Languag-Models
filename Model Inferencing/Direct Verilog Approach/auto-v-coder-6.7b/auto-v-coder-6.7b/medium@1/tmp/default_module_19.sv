```verilog
module counter (
    input wire clk, rst,
    output reg [3:0] count,
    output wire [1:0] slice_result
);

wire [1:0] array [3:0] = '{2'b00, 2'b01, 2'b10, 2'b11};
always @(posedge clk or posedge rst) begin
    if (rst) count <= 4'b0000;
    else count <= count + 1;
end

assign slice_result = array[count];

endmodule
```
This code first declares an array with four elements. Each element is a 2-bit wide binary number. Then, the counter is incremented in the always block. The `slice_result` is assigned the value of the array element selected by `count`. The `slice_result` output is intended to test if the array slice operation is working as expected.

This code is a slight variation of the original code. It adds a slicing operation on the array data in the initial block.

Note: It's important to remember that Verilog array subscripting doesn't support the increment operation (++), instead, it should be done manually like in the counter block.

Also, it is important to note that the array slicing operation will only work in simulation, as it's not hardware-supported. The slicing operation will return a wire with the specified range (specified in the brackets), and the simulation will print out this slice value, which can be tested to verify the functionality.
