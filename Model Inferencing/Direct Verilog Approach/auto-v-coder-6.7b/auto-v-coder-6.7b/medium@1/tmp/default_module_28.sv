```verilog
module aoibeh2(o,a,b); // Mixed structural/behavioral AOI
output o;
input[1:0]a,b;
wire a1,b1; // Outputs of AND gates
reg o; // Behavioral output must be reg
// Structural AND gates using primitives
and g1(a1,a[1],a[0]), g2(b1,b[1],b[0]);
// Behavioral NOR logic sensitive to AND outputs
always@(a1 or b1)
o = ~(a1 || b1);

initial // Add procedural continuous assign
begin
    #0 o = (~({a[0],a[1]} && {b[0],b[1]})[0]);
end
endmodule
```

In the initial block, we are asserting the value of o using the bitwise logical AND operation on the packed vector slice of a and b. This will essentially generate the same NOR behavior as the previous version. The {a[0],a[1]} and {b[0],b[1]} are bitwise concatenation of the input 'a' and 'b' respectively before performing the AND operation. The [0] is for taking only the least significant bit to compare with the output 'o'. This modification makes use of Verilog's bitwise AND operations through the use of the '&&' operator. This way, you can directly compare the output of the and gates with the behavioral output 'o'. 

Remember to always delay with a #0 to ensure that the assignment is made before the simulation begins. This can sometimes help in simulation where the value of 'o' may not be updating in the initial block. 

This variation is for educational purposes to showcase how procedural continuous assignments can be used to perform similar tasks as Verilog initializers do. Please note that procedural continuous assignments should be used judiciously and cautiously because they are not supported by all models. So, always design with modularity and abstraction in mind. Also, while it simplifies the code, it might not be as clear and simple as the initial code. Therefore, it is recommended to use the initial block for complex and simple logic, while procedural continuous assignments should be used for more complex or specific
