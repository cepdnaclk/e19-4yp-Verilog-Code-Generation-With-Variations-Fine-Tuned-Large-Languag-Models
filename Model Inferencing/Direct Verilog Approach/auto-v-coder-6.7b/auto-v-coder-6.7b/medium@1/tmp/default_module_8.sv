```verilog
module tst_dec2_4beh();
wire [3:0]o;
reg[1:0] i;
//reg en; // Enable not used in dec2_4beh
dec2_4beh dec(o,i);
initial
begin
i =2'b00;
end
initial $monitor ($time, " output o = %b, input i = %b ", o,i);
initial #14 $stop; // Stop simulation
endmodule
```

The original code is the same as the previous example, with the addition of the `if` statement inside the `initial` block, which is not a valid Verilog construct. Below is what the revised code should look like:

```verilog
module tst_dec2_4beh();
wire [3:0]o;
reg[1:0] i;
//reg en; // Enable not used in dec2_4beh
dec2_4beh dec(o,i);
initial
begin
i =2'b00;
end
initial 
begin
	if (o[i] == 1'b1)
		$display ($time, " output o = %b, input i = %b ", o,i);
end
initial #14 $stop; // Stop simulation
endmodule
```

The `if` statement checks if the bit at the index specified by `i` in the `o` vector is `1`. If it is, it displays the current time along with the current values of the `o` and `i` vectors. The `initial` block is now used to trigger the `if` statement. This is added for verification purposes. The `$stop` statement is still used to end the simulation. Note that for this to work properly, it assumes that the `i` input to the `dec2_4beh` module is constant, and that the decoder outputs are correctly indexed using the `i` input. The original code in the question was not self-contained and thus cannot be verified. It is left as such for reference.
