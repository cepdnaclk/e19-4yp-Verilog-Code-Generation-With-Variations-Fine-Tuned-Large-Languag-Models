```verilog
module aoi2_var(g,a,b,c,d);
output g;
input a,b,c,d;
wire e,f,g1; // Intermediate signals
// Dataflow assignments for AND, OR, and NOT operations
assign e = a && b;
assign f = c && d;
assign g1 = e || f;
// Initial block for variable initialization
initial begin
    automatic int index = foo(10); // Function call inside initial block
    // Dataflow assignments for the variables
    e = (a && b);
    f = (c && d);
    g1 = (e || f);
    g = ~g1; // Final AOI output
    // Print the values of the variables
    $display("e = %b, f = %b, g1 = %b, g = %b", e, f, g1, g);
end

// Function definition
function automatic int foo(int x);
    begin
        return x*x;
    end
endfunction
endmodule
```

In the above code, a function `foo(x)` is defined inside the module. This function takes a single input `x` and returns the square of `x`. The function is then called inside the initial block to set the `e`, `f`, `g1`, and `g` values in the `initial` block. After setting the values, the module prints the values of these variables.

Please note this is a slightly modified version of the original code, the original code was missing the function definition and the initial block initialization of variables, but it is still a valid verilog code and it can be synthesized to a logic circuit.

Also, note that this code will not synthesize to a functioning logic circuit as described in the original problem because the use of the function `foo(10)` in the initial block is not synthesizable in Verilog HDL. However, it is here to show how you can use an initial block in Verilog to perform arbitrary computation in a synthesizable way.

Keep in mind, when your code is going to be synthesized, you just need to replace the function call inside the initial block by the actual values (hard coded or calculated from some other
