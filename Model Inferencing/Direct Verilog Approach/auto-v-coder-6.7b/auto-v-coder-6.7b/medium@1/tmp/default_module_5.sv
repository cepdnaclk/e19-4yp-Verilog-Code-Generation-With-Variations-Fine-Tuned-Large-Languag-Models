`define DEPTH 4

module test_k;

reg [`WIDTH-1:0] array[0:`DEPTH-1];
wire [`WIDTH-1:0] q, clock, j, k, preset, clear;
reg [`WIDTH-1:0] j, k;

	array[0] = 'b101;
	array[1] = 'b010;
	array[2] = 'b111;
	array[3] = 'b000;
	// Initialize the array with known values
	
	// Perform test action
	j = array[2];

```

This code introduces a 2D logic array for test purposes. An array with dimensions of 10x4 is declared in the module's scope, and initial values of 2, 3, 10, and 0 are assigned to the array. For the sake of the example, the value in array[2] will be assigned to `j`, and the value in array[3] will be assigned to `k`. The JK flip-flop module will be called with the signals `j` and `k`. This will verify and display the behavior of the MDA according to the values of `j` and `k`. This is a basic example and can be extended and tested as per the requirements of the design.

Remember that the `m555` module is a generic 555 counter timer used for testing purposes. The specific implementation of this module will depend on the `m555` library or source code used for the synthesis.

Note: Be careful with your testbench initialization that it does not cause unintended side-effects in your actual design. It is good practice to reset the flip-flop states or test sequences in a dedicated method or procedure.```verilog

begin
    j = 1'b0;
