```verilog
module mux21b (
input wire a[1:0],
input wire b[1:0],
input wire s,
output reg y[1:0]// Output must be reg for procedural assignment
);
always @(*) // Combinational sensitivity
begin
unique case(s)
0: y <= a;
1: y <= b;
endcase
end
endmodule
```
In this variation, the original 1-bit multiplexer has been extended to a 2-bit multiplexer with 2-bit inputs and outputs. By using a packed array, the multiplexer can handle both inputs and output at the same time, making it more efficient.

Please note that you must use the `<=` operator in Verilog as usual assignment operator (`=`) is not supported in procedural assignments in Verilog. It is used for combinational logic as this is the intended operation based on the sensitivity list specified in the module. Variables should be declared with `reg` or `wire` using `reg` when you plan on changing the value.
This code also uses sensitivity list in the always block, which allows the design to handle both inputs and output at the same time, making it more efficient. 

Additionally, as in the original code, the sensitivity list specifies the change in the input, so it will re-evaluate the condition whenever the input changes. 

Regarding the unique case, it means that the case statement will execute the first matching condition, and the other conditions will be ignored. 

Lastly, the sensitivity list `@*` is used to make this block re-evaluate whenever *any* of the inputs change, which is usually the desired behavior for combinational logic. This means that it should be placed into an always block to ensure combinational logic behavior. Thatâ€™s why we use `*` in the sensitivity list. 
In this code, the sensitivity list `@*` is used to re-evaluate the condition when any of the inputs change. This ensures that the output changes when the input changes. This is the intended behavior for a multiplexer, which selects an input based on a control signal.

Please note that the sensitivity list must be placed inside an initial or always block for it to be triggered on the change of input values.
