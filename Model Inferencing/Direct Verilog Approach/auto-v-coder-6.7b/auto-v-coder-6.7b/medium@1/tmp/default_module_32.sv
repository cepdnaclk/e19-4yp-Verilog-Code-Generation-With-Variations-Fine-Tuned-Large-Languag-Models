```verilog
module dff(do,di,clk); // Behavioral D Flip-Flop
output reg [8:0] do;
input [7:0] di;
input clk;
always @(posedge clk) begin
    case(di[2:0])
        3'b000 : do <= 9'b000000000;
        3'b001 : do <= 9'b111111111;
        default : do <= 9'bxxxxxxxxx;
    endcase
end
endmodule
```
In this code, we have modified the initial output value for the system. In the case statement, we have created a case for the 3-bit input `di`. If the 3-bit input is `000`, the output `do` will be `0`. If the 3-bit input is `001`, the output `do` will be `111111111`. For all other cases, the output `do` is undefined. Please ensure to match your specific case, I have assumed 000 and 001 for case 0 and case 1 respectively. 

Note: Always use reg for outputs in system verilog, as in Verilog it is recommended to use reg for outputs, while in Verilog for System Verilog it is recommended to use reg for all variables (input, output, inout, and interconnects). Also note that `reg` and `wire` declarations in System Verilog are not necessary as System Verilog automatically detects the direction at compile time. In this case, the `reg` declaration was added for clarity, but it could be removed without affecting the logic.###

The modified code should be compatible with all Verilog versions as System Verilog is a superset of Verilog and the given code snippet follows the guidelines of System Verilog. The case statement is used to assign an output based on an input, and the output is modified based on the input, which is an example of a combinational logic in Verilog. It uses a single bit input and a single bit output. However, the code will behave as a behavioral D Flip-Flop by neg
