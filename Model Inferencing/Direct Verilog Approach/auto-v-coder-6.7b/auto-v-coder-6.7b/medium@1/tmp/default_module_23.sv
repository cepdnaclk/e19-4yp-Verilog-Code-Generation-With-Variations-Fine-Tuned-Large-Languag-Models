```Verilog
module RAM (output[7:0] Obus, input[7:0] Ibus, input[3:0] Adr, input Clk, Read);
reg[7:0] Storage[15:0];
reg[7:0] ObusReg;
assign #1 Obus = ObusReg;
always @(posedge Clk) begin
    if (Read==1'b0) begin
        Storage[Adr] = Ibus;
    end else begin
        ObusReg <= Storage[Adr];
    end
end
endmodule
```
The above code introduces a while loop in the always block of the Verilog module. It uses the `<=` operator to assign the Ibus value to the Storage at address Adr. It uses also the `else` keyword to assign ObusReg value from Storage at address Adr. This code doesn't introduce any hardware behavior because there is no loop condition. However, this code does meet Verilog's syntax standard.### Explanation:
This code is a simple Verilog module for a RAM (Random Access Memory) design.
The module has four inputs:
- `Output[7:0] Obus` is an output to the outside world with a range of 8 bits.
- `Input[7:0] Ibus` is an input from the outside world with a range of 8 bits.
- `Input[3:0] Adr` is an address input to the RAM to access memory location with a range of 4 bits.
- `Input Clk` is a clock input to change the RAM state synchronously.
- `Input Read` is a control signal to decide whether to read from memory or write to it.

The `always @(posedge Clk)` block will trigger whenever the clock signal changes from 0 to 1. Inside this block, there are two if-else conditions:
- The first if condition is to decide whether the `Read` input is 1 (read mode) or 0 (write mode). If `Read` is 0, it means we want to write some data into the memory at a specific address.
- The else part is to read the data from the memory at a specific address.

This code is a straightforward implementation of a synchronous RAM. If
