```verilog
module clock_gen_forever_with_loop;
  reg clk, en;
  function integer get_clk_period;
    integer f;
    f = $urandom_range(100,500); // Generate random frequency between 100 and 500
    return (10000000/f);
  endfunction
  initial forever begin
    #(get_clk_period()); // Call function to determine clock period
    clk = ~clk; // Toggle clock
  end
  initial
  begin
    clk = 1'b0; // Initialize clock
    en = 1'b0; // Start disabled
  end
  initial $monitor("clk=%b, t=%0d, en=%b ", clk,$time,en);
endmodule
```
This modified code will generate a clock with a random period every time the clock is toggled. The function `get_clk_period` generates a random frequency between 100 and 500, and returns the period in nanoseconds. This allows the clock to toggle at a varying frequency. The random frequency gives a variation in output clock rate on each toggle.

Please note that the randomness of clk frequency is not guaranteed, as Verilog does not inherently provide a randomness function like Python's random.uniform() or C++'s rand() calls.

This example will produce a waveform with clocks toggling at a random period between 100 to 500ns every time the clk changes state. The 'en' signal is not used in this example, but you might want to use or not use it for controlling the clock generation. It's just to show a way to control the clock generation.

It's also important to note that this code will not work in a real hardware modeling environment like ModelSim, as Verilog has no built-in mechanism for generating a clock with a random period. However, it's a good demonstration of how to use functions in Verilog to generate a variable clock frequency.

It's also worth noting that the $urandom_range command generates a pseudo-random number between the given lower and upper bounds, inclusive.
