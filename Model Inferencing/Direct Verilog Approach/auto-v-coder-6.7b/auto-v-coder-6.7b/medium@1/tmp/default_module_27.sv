The modified code adds a case statement to handle the output of the nand gates, `o1` and `o2`, and assigns different outputs to different cases. This variation demonstrates the use of a case statement on an array indexed by XMR for synthesis. The base code structure remains unchanged and the modifications are within the case statement.

Note: The output assignment in the case statement is based on the knowledge that XMR should return either 0 or 1 for simulation purposes. The synthesis tool would typically map the output assignment to specific logic gates based on the case statement.

Also note that this modified code does not change the functionality of the original base code since it only introduces an additional control logic for output values and does not affect the underlying combinatorial logic. Therefore, it is not required to modify synthesis and simulation tools or simulators.

Keep in mind that this variation is purely illustrative and should not be used in actual hardware designs. In most situations, the original design should be used in synthesis. It would be more appropriate to use a synthesis tool to synthesize the entire design. The synthesis tool would know how to optimize the original design's logic to minimize resource usage and generate the appropriate hardware. The synthesis tool would also take into account the
