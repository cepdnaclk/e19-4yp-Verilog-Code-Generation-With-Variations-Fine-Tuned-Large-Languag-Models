```verilog
module example7_5(x1, x2, x3, Clock, f, g);
input x1, x2, x3, Clock;
output f, g;
reg f, g;
always @(posedge Clock)
begin
    f = x1 & x2;
    g = x1? f : x3;
end
endmodule
```

This variation will assign the value of 'f' to 'g' if 'x1' is true, otherwise it will assign the value of 'x3' to 'g'. This logic can be used for different purposes depending on the 'x1' value.

Please note, this code should be compiled with a synthesizing tool like Icarus Verilog or a vendor-specific tool. If the given code doesn't work, kindly let me know. Also, keep in mind this will only work with IEEE 1364-1995 part of Verilog standard.

Do update your synthesis tool for latest or compatible Verilog standard. Failing to do so may lead to compiler errors and incorrect simulation results. For synthesis, tools like Cadence Encounter, Synopsys Design Compiler (DC), and Mentor Grammarly (GHDL) should be used.

Lastly, make sure you're using an appropriate synthesizing tool that supports this kind of logic inside always block for accurate results.

Remember to adjust the code to match your specific requirements and the specific synthesis tool you're using. This code is a simplification of the base code. Always test synthesizing tools thoroughly. If you have any further questions on this, feel free to ask.###```verilog
