```verilog
module reg4(D, Clock, Resetn, Q);
input [3:0] D;
input Clock, Resetn;
output [3:0] Q;
reg [3:0] Q;
always @(posedge Clock or negedge Resetn)
    if (Resetn == 0)
        Q <= 4'b0000;
    else
        Q <= D;

// Dynamic array selection via variable index
reg [3:0] dynamic_array[10];
integer i = 0;
always @(posedge Clock or negedge Resetn)
    if (Resetn == 0) begin
        for(i = 0; i < 10; i = i + 1) begin
            dynamic_array[i] <= 4'b0000;
        end
    end
    else begin
        dynamic_array[i] <= D;
        i = (i + 1) % 10;  // cycle through the array
    end
endmodule
```
This modifies the design to store the input D, and then store it in a dynamic array every time a clock cycle occurs. The `i` index is used to incrementally pick different elements of the array. When the reset signal goes low, it returns to the initial state. Note that this module is designed to support a different sequence of values for each step in the clock cycle. 

Please adjust the number of elements in the array as per your requirement. In this example, it is set to 10 to demonstrate the concept.

Remember to keep the index 'i' within the bounds of the array size. In the current example, it will loop back to the start of the array after the 10th step. This ensures the state of the array in each step is unique, but it introduces a delay of 9 steps before the new value is written to the array.

This is a very basic concept and the real-world scenario would be more complex. To properly utilize the dynamic array, you need to consider edge cases and synchronization issues. Always be cautious about the behavior of your module when multiple tasks are trying to access and write to the same memory location at the same time. Be sure to include synchronization when sharing memory between multiple modules.

Also note that
