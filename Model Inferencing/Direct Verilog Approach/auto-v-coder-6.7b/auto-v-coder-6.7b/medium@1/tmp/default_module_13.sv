```verilog
module tst_wand1;
reg [7:0] i1,i2;
wire o;
wand1 ww(i1,i2,o);
initial
begin
i1=8'b00000000; i2=8'b00000000;
end
initial $monitor($time,"i1=%b,i2=%b,o=%b",i1,i2,o);
initial #8 $stop;
endmodule
```
The above is a verilog code that simulates the `wand1` module. 

The `wand1` module is a custom module which will perform 'and' operation between the two input bits. Our output (`o`) will be the result of this operation. 

`i1` and `i2` are the input bits used to perform the operation.

`$monitor` is a task that prints the values of the signals at the current simulation time. 

`$stop` is a function that stops the simulation and writes the output file. 

The `initial` block is used to initialize values of i1 and i2 at time 0.

Please note that the `wand1` module and its corresponding verilog file are not provided in the given problem, so we assume that you have a `wand1` module that takes two inputs and produces one output.

The code simulates the `wand1` module for 8 time units (`#8`) and then stops the simulation.

This code can be used in any simulator that supports SystemVerilog like Icarus Verilog, Modelsim etc. to verify the functionality of the `wand1` module.

Please replace the `wand1` module with your actual `wand1` module. Also, this is an example. You may need to change the testbench according to your requirement.```verilog
module wand1(i1, i2, o);
input i1, i2;
output reg o;

always @(*) begin
    o = i1 & i2; // performing and operation between the two inputs
end
endmodule
```
