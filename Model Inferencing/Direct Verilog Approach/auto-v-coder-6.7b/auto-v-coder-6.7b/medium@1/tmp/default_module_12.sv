```verilog
module maj3 (a, b, c, y);
parameter PORT_WIDTH = 3;
input [PORT_WIDTH-1:0] a, b, c;
output y;
wire [PORT_WIDTH-1:0] im;
assign im[0] = a[1] & a[2];
assign im[1] = b[0] & b[2];
assign im[2] = c[0] & c[1];
assign y = |im;
endmodule
```
In this modified version, we declare an array of wires im[PORT_WIDTH-1:0] to represent each input. We then assign to each element in the im array the result of the operation a[1] & a[2], b[0] & b[2], and c[0] & c[1] respectively. Finally, we assign y to the or-reduction of the im array. This should achieve the same functionality as the original code. This modified code is more readable but might not be faster in terms of performance due to the added assignments and OR operation.

If you wanted to stick with your original design, you could use a multiplexer to selectively feed the AND outputs to the OR gate. Here is how it could look like:

```verilog
module maj3 (a, b, c, y);
input a, b, c;
output y;
wire im1, im2, im3;
assign im1 = a & b;
assign im2 = b & c;
assign im3 = c & a;
assign y =  im1 | im2 | im3;
endmodule
```
This code does the same thing as the original but it uses multiplexer instead of the OR gate for data selection. It is probably less readable but might offer a slight speed improvement in terms of hardware design efficiency.

Remember that Verilog does not allow a single wire assignment within always block. You would likely have to use a Verilog `if-else` statement instead. However, the overall concept is the same and this variation is not intended to improve the functionality or efficiency but to demonstrate a different Verilog way of doing the same thing. 

Lastly, note that you can't use XMR-style indexing `im[
