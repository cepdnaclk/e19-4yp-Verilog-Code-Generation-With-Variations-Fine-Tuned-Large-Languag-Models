```verilog
module ALU8 (input [7:0] left, right, input [1:0] mode, output reg [7:0] ALUout);
always_comb begin
    case (mode)
        0: ALUout = left + right;
        1: ALUout = left - right;
        2: ALUout = left & right;
        3: ALUout = left | right;
        default: ALUout = 8'bX;
    endcase
end
endmodule
```
- The `always @(left, right, mode) begin...end` block is replaced with the `always_comb` declaration that is more general and handles more cases. 
   - This instruction is used for combinational logic, where you wish to calculate the output based on the current values of the inputs. When any inputs change, the module should calculate an output.
- The inside of the always block is the same logic as before. 
- Note that the inputs don't need to be declared as reg inside the always_comb block because their values do not change, only the output of the block, `ALUout`, will change.
- The array part select is valid inside an always_comb or always_ff block. The part select is used to select a section of the array. In this case, it is used to select specific bits in the ALUout. The syntax for the part select is `[high:low]` where `high` and `low` are indexes of the array. The `high:low` syntax is generally used to select a continuous range of elements in the array.
- The `default: ALUout = 8'bX;` line is added to handle the case when mode is not recognized. Here, 'X' is the don't care value and allows for some flexibility in the design. 

Please remember to include the appropriate sensitivity list in the always_comb block to handle changes in the input values appropriately. It is necessary for the Verilog simulation and synthesis tools to know when the module should re-evaluate because the inputs have changed.
