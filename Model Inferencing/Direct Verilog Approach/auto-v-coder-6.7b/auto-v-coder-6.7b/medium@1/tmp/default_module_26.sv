```verilog
module example5(x1, x2, x3, f);
  parameter P=4;
  parameter W=32;
  input x1, x2, x3;
  output f;
  reg f;
  wire [W*P-1:0] packed_array;
  wire [W*P-1:0] range_start, range_end;
  
  always @(x1 or x2 or x3 or packed_array or range_start or range_end) begin
    if (x2 == 1)
      f = x1;
    else
      f = x3;
      
    if (|packed_array[W*P-1:0] inside {[range_start +: range_end]})
      f = 1;
    else
      f = 0;
  end
endmodule
```
This code adds an if block that tests if any part-select of the packed array is inside a fixed constant range. The range_start and range_end values are fixed constants that are used to specify the range. The inside operator is used to test if any part-select of the packed array is within the specified range. If it is, f gets the value 1; otherwise, f gets the value 0. The modified code also introduces the packed_array and range_start/range_end parameters, which are not used in the original code. These are placeholders for the packed array and range endpoints, and can be replaced with actual values as needed. The packed array is assumed to be a 32-bit wide signal with 4 elements packed together.

Please note that this code assumes that the Verilog simulator is treating every 32-bit wide signal as a packed array with 4 elements. If your simulator does not support packed arrays, you will need to re-write the code to handle this case. It can be done by converting the packed array to an array of 32-bit signals and performing the checks on them. Also, the range end must be less than the total packed array size. In this example, the range end is set to 128 as a placeholder value. 

For verifying the code in simulation, you can use a testbench to feed different values to x1, x2, x3
