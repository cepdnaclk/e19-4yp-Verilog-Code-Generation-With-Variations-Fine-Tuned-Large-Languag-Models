```verilog
module example7_5(D, Clock, Q);
input D, Clock;
output reg [31:0] Q; // Using 32 bit width packed array
integer j; // Declaration of a variable
always @(posedge Clock)
begin
    Q[0] <= D; // Assign D to the first bit of the array
    j <= 1; // Assign 1 to j
    while(j < 32) // While j is less than 32
    begin
        Q[j] <= Q[j-1]; // Shift the bits one place to left
        j <= j + 1; // Increment j
    end
end
endmodule
```
This code will update the Q array with the input data D in a serial manner. The bits shift from the rightmost bit of Q array to the leftmost bit in each clock cycle. The value of j is used to control the while loop termination condition, and the array is updated only 32 times per clock cycle.

Note: This code assumes that the width of the array is 32 and will change this as per your needs.

Also, make sure to replace the "D", "Clock", "Q" in above code with your actual signal names. The example7_5 module is using a packed array Q to store the 32 bits of data. If your simulation does not provide the necessary amount of time for this code to work you may need to adjust the loop termination condition or the delay added to the clock to prevent it from making a loop longer than the clock period.

In Verilog, always blocks are sensitive to changes in all signals within a block. It guarantees that the output will be updated at the completion of the clock edge. This is also known as event-driven programming style.

The @(posedge Clock) sensitivity list says that the always block will be triggered every time the positive edge of the clock is detected. 

The <= operator is used to assign a value to a register in Verilog, and it is a blocking assignment operator. This means that it is a one-time assignment and does not wait for the value to be updated.

The if-else construct is used to control the timing and value of the assignments made to the registers within the always block.
