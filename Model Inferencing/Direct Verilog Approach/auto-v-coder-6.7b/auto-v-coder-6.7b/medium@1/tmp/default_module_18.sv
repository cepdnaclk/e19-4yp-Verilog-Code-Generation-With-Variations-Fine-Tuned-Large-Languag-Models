In this code, I've modified the `always@(*)` block to use a `case` statement to determine the output `y` based on the inputs `a`, `b`, and `c`. The inputs are packed into a 3-bit vector to use with the `case` statement.

The output `y` will be 1 when all inputs are 1 and 0 otherwise.

Please note that this code does exactly the same as the original code since it doesn't add any useful functionality. It's just a demonstration for the purpose of modifying always block to include inside expression on an operand resulting from function-call return array. In a real application, the real use case would be different.### 

Please replace the `always@(*)` block with the actual functionality as per your requirements. Do not forget to replace `maj3_p` with your module name and `a`, `b`, `c` with your input ports and `im1`, `im2`, `im3` with your output ports. `tplh1`, `tphl1`, `tplh2`, `tphl2` can
