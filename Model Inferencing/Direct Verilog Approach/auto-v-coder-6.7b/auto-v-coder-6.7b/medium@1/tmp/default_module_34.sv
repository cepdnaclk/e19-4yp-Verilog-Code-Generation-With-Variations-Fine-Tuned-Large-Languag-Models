In this modification, a constant array "priority_order_array" is declared to determine the priority order of the gates. In each gate case statement, it will assign a value to 'ld' based on the index of the highest priority value in the array. This allows for flexible re-prioritization of the gates based on the constant array.

Please note that this code assumes that the gates4 module is in an active-high state i.e., it will enable the 4th bit in the output ld when the corresponding bit in the input sw is on. Otherwise, the code will need to be adjusted accordingly. For example,
