In the modified code, we added a wire-type array `const_values` which holds the 4-bit constant values for indexes from 0 to 7. The default case of the case statement, when index is out of the 0-7 range, takes the sum of the indexed part select on operand A and the operand B. This can be used as a mechanism of error handling or debugging purposes.

Note that the `indexed part select` method (A[3:2]) is used, which is equivalent to `A >>2` in decimal system, it shifts the binary representation of the number to the right by 2 places, effectively dividing it by 4. The result is used as the index to the `const_values` array. If the value of A is not defined this way, the default case would be executed which is adding the indexed part select on operand A and the operand B.

This might not be practical depending on the system requirements. 

If you want to add error handling, you should be aware of the values used in the array and consider error cases outside of 7 and 0-7. The default case is for those cases not explicitly
