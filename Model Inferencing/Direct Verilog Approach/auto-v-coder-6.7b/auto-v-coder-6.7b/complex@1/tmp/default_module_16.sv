```verilog
`include "package.sv"

module tb_TOP1;
  reg CLK, RST_X;
  TOP1 uut(.CLK(CLK),.RST_X(RST_X));

  initial begin
    CLK = 0;
    forever #5 CLK = ~CLK;
  end

  initial begin
    RST_X = 0; #10;
    RST_X = 1;
  end
endmodule

module TOP1(input wire CLK, input wire RST_X,output wire [2:0] Y);
  reg [2:0] x;
  initial begin
    x = 3'b000;
  end

  always @ (posedge CLK) begin
    if(RST_X) x <= 'b000;
    else x <= x + 1;
  end

  assign Y = (x inside {const_array})? x : 'b000;

endmodule
```
In the `TOP1` module, instead of using a constant array in the `inside` operator, we are using a constant array defined in a package (named `package.sv`). The `TOP1` module is now comparing `x` against the array defined in this package.

Please replace `const_array` with the array you want to use in the `inside` operator.

The `package.sv` should look something like this:

```verilog
package package_name;
  const logic [2:0] const_array[5] = '{3'b001, 3'b010, 3'b011, 3'b100, 3'b101};
endpackage
```
This const_array can then be used in the comparator logic.

Please adjust the size of the array and the array values according to your needs. Also, in `TOP1` module, according to the package, you should use the correct array.

This modification will enable the comparator logic to compare the `x` value against a constant array. It's important to note that this modification should be done carefully as this example does not
