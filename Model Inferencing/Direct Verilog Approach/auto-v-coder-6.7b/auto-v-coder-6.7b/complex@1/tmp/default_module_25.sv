This modified code includes generate block to handle the HiCount condition and the `inside` operator to handle the values of HiCount. The `HiCount` variable is now a package-scope variable and it's inside the `encoder` module. Also, the Adjr assignment is now inside the generate block, and it assigns the correct Adjr value based on the HiCount. This ensures that the condition of the HiCount is updated each time a new input is given to the encoder. Finally, the encoding logic is modified to include the Adjr and Hibits in addition to the BCD input. This updated code allows the `encoder` to handle the specific conditions and assignments based on the input BCD value.

The original code provided would not work properly because the Adjr and Hibits assignments were always assigned the same values since these are not dependent on the BCD_in and HiCount. So the changes made ensure that the conditions and assignments
