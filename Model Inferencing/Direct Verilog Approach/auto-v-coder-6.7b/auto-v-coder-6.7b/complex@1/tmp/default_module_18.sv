```verilog
module test(out);
  output reg [1:0] out;
  
  integer X [0:3] = {0,1,2,3};
  integer Y [0:3] = {1,2,3,4};

  always @(*) begin
    if (out inside {X,Y}) begin
      out <= 2'b00;
    end else begin
      out <= 2'b01;
    end
  end
endmodule
```

In this modified code, whenever `out` is found in array `X` or array `Y`, `out` is set to 00; otherwise `out` is set to 01. This is a placeholder code. Replace `X` and `Y` with your actual arrays and modify the condition accordingly. Also, ensure to replace `2'b00` and `2'b01` with the appropriate value/variable based on your requirement.
Please note that Verilog does not support the `inside` keyword inside an `always @(*)` block, hence the workaround is to use a `for` loop to iterate through each element of `X` and `Y` and then compare `out` with each element. 

Alternatively you can use `$in` operator as `out inside {X,Y}` would not work in a always block.

```verilog
module test(out);
  output reg [1:0] out;
  
  integer X [0:3] = {0,1,2,3};
  integer Y [0:3] = {1,2,3,4};

  always @(*) begin
    integer i;
    for(i = 0; i < 4; i = i + 1) begin
      if (X[i] == out || Y[i] == out) begin
        out <= 2'b00;
        break;
      end else begin
        out <= 2'b01;
      end
    end
  end
endmodule
```
This would also keep the logic of finding the `out` in arrays `X` and `Y` and setting it to 00 or 01 accordingly.

Remember the `$in` operator
