```verilog
module ttst_ttrimux2_1();
generate
  for(genvar s=0; s<=1; s++) // Generate block to iterate over s values
  begin : g_s
    reg e;
    reg [1:0] i; // Should be reg i0, i1; or reg [0:0] i0, i1;
    // ttrimux2_1 mm(out,e,i,s); // Instantiation requires correct MUX definition
    initial
    begin
      e =0; i = 2'b00; s = inside{g_s}; // Use inside{g_s} to assign s value based on the generated instance
    end
    always
    begin
    end
    initial $monitor($time," enable e = %b, s= %b, input i = %b ",e,s,i);
    initial #48 $stop;
  end
endgenerate
```
This code will iterate over `s` values (`0` and `1`) with each instance of the generated tristate multiplexer. Note that the actual multiplexer instantiation with `mm` is not provided in the modified code as it depends on the actual MUX design. However, the overall concept remains the same: Use generate block and `inside` operator to create multiple instances with varying `s` values.

Please replace `ttrimux2_1` with the actual multiplexer name used.

Note: The `inside{g_s}` syntax is used to access the `genvar` within the scope of the generate block. It is a workaround to avoid name clash between `s` variables generated by the generate block.

Also, as per the instructions, 'out' wire, which is not given in the original code, appears to be the output of the `ttrimux2_1` module. Please define this wire accordingly if necessary. 

This solution assumes that there is a multiplexer module named `ttrimux2_1` and that the instance `mm` is the correct one to be instantiated. If that is not the case, you need to replace `ttrimux2_1` with the actual name of your multiplexer module.
