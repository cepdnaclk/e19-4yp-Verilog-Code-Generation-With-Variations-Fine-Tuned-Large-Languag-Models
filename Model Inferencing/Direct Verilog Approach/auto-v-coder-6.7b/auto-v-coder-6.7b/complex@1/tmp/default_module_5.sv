This code is a simple sequential circuit equivalent to the one in the original problem. The state transition logic is replaced by a case statement to make the code cleaner and easier to read. The outputs `z` and `y` are registered and are updated on the positive edge of the clock. The `Resetn` input is used to reset the state to `A`.

Remember that the state register `y` has two bits due to using a binary encoding for the state. In this case, `A` is encoded as `00` and `B` as `01`. A variable `{z, y}` could also be used for state encoding. The `w` inputs are also registered, which is the default in SV.

This code is a simple representation of a Mealy Machine. Mealy Machines have two outputs depending on the state and the input. In this Mealy Machine, there is one input `w` and one output `z`. If `w` is 1, `z` is 1. Otherwise, `z` is 0. The state is in either `A` or `B`. If the state is `A`, and `w` is 1, the next state is `B`. Otherwise, the next state is `A`. If the state is `B`, and `w` is 1
