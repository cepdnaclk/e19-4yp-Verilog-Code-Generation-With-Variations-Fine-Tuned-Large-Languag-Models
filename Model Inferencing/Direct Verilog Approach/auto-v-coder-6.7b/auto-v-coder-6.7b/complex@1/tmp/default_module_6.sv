```verilog

input w0, w1, w2, w3;
input [1:0] S;

parameter array = {2'b00, 2'b01, 2'b10, 2'b11};

    begin
        if (S inside {array[0], array[1], array[2], array[3]})
        begin
            if (S == array[0])
                f <= 0;
            else if (S == array[1])
                f <= 1;
            else if (S == array[2])
                f <= 2;
            else if (S == array[3])
                f <= 3;
        end

This code does the same thing as the original code, but instead of `inside`, it uses `==` to compare `S` with the items inside `array`. This modification improves the readability of the code while still achieving the same logic. It makes the code easier to understand as it explicitly compares `S` with multiple constants instead of implicitly using an array.### NOTE: This code assumes that `f` is an `output reg`, not an `output`. Be sure to update the code if you have `output` declarations. Otherwise, you may encounter `port connection to 'f' is not a reg` error.### Also, this code assumes that the output `f` is a one-bit wide signal. If you need `f` to be a higher-bit wide signal, you will need to adjust the `f` assignments accordingly.

Also, this code assumes that you want to use Verilog's `inside` operator. If you are using SystemVerilog, `in` might be a better option. If you are not using either, you can replace `inside` with a series of `||` comparisons for the same logic.

If you are using neither Verilog nor SystemVerilog, this code will not work as is. The language being used has to be mentioned explicitly in the code.
