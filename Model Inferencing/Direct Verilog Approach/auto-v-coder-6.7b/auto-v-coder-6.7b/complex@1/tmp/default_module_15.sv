With this modification, the code now includes a reset signal `rst_n` to reset the counter to zero when it receives a negative edge on `rst_n`. The reset signal is initialized to 0 and then driven to 1 after 5 time units. This effectively resets the counter to 0 when the simulation starts.

This modification addresses the need for a reset signal to correctly handle the counter. Note that the `rst_n` signal is considered active low in the `updcounter` module. Therefore, the reset functionality is achieved by driving `rst_n` to 1 after a positive edge. This way, the `updcounter` module's reset functionality will be triggered and the counter will reset to 0 when the simulation starts.
