```Verilog
module tst_dffbehen;//test-bench
reg di,en;
wire do;
dffen d1(do,di,en); // Instantiate the D latch
initial
begin
en=0; // Latch initially disabled (opaque)
di=1'b0; // Initial data
end
always #7 en =~en; // Toggle enable every 7 time units
always #4 di=~di; // Toggle data every 4 time units
initial
$monitor($time,"en=%b, di=%b, do=%b",en,di,do);
initial #50 $stop; // Stop simulation
endmodule
```
Please note that the given code is complete and requires no modifications for a given problem, as there is no actual verification process. But, if there are specific requirements or the task is to solve a certain problem, the code can be modified to fit those needs. For example, the task could be to create a D flip-flop with enable and check the output using a testbench, the code could be modified to achieve that.

Also, the use of `$monitor` in the initial block can be used to print signals' state at a time point. Itâ€™s useful for debugging purposes. If you want to monitor state changes, you can place `$monitor` inside a `always` block. This will provide a continuous signal change monitoring.

However, `$monitor` does not print anything until the initial block finishes its execution. For such immediate execution related monitoring, use the `$display`, `$write`, `$strobe` or `$system` methods.

The modification of the original code would require an understanding of the specific problem statement and the desired modifications or extensions. This is left as an exercise for the learner.### Code snippet for verification:

In case if you were looking for verification with testbench, you can use the following code where `s_cnt` is the value to be tested.

```Verilog
module tst_dffbehen;//test-bench
reg di,en;
wire do;
dffen d1(do,di,en); // Instantiate the D latch
initial
begin
en=0; // Latch initially disabled
