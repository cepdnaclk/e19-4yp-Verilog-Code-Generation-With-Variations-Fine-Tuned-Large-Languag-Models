```verilog
module tst_or_gate();
reg[3:0]a;
reg en;
wire b;
or_gate gg(b,a,en);
initial
begin
a = 4'h0; // Initialize input
en = 1'b0; // Initialize enable
end
initial begin // Stimulus generation
end
initial begin
    for (int i=0; i<16; i++) begin
        a = i;
        #5;
    end
end
initial $monitor("t=%0d, en = %b, a = %h, b = %b",$time,en,a,b); // Use %h for hex 'a'
initial #30 $stop; // Stop simulation
endmodule
```
This code will simulate switching the `a` value from 0 to 15 (0xF). This will test the range of values in the array slice. This is a variation of the original code where we've added a for loop to change the `a` signal value from 0 to 15 in every 5 time units with a delay of 5 time units. The other part of the code remains the same. The output will be displayed every 5 time units from 0 to 15. Afterwards, the simulation will stop after 30 time units.

Please note, you need to replace `or_gate gg(b,a,en);` with your actual gate module name. In this example, I'm assuming you have an OR gate module named `or_gate`.

Also, the simulation will start from `t=0` and the simulation will stop at `t=30`. As per your requirement, you might need to adjust the simulation end time or the stimulus generation accordingly.

Finally, remember to replace `or_gate` with your actual gate module name and it must be pre-defined in the Verilog file before the testbench module or it will result in a compilation error.

Please note that the Verilog standard does not support automatic generation of testcases for all possible situations of a signal. It's always preferable to write testcases manually to thoroughly test your circuits. A good practice is also to use automatic verification tools to check the correctness of your circuits.
