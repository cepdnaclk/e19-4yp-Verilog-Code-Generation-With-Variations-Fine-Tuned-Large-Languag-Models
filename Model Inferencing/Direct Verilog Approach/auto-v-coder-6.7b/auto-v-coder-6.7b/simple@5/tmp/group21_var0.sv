In this modified code, we define a class called `example4` with rand variables `x1`, `x2`, `x3`, and `x4`. The function `post_randomize` is automatically called after randomization. This function calculates the output signals `f`, `g`, and `h` based on the input signals `x1`, `x2`, `x3`, and `x4`.

Then, in the testbench, we create an instance of `example4` and display its input and output signals. The `$display` statement is used to display the generated random values and calculated outputs.

This modified code can be used to generate random inputs to the `example4` module and can be used to test if the `post_randomize` function behaves as expected.

Please note that `$display` should be replaced with a suitable debugging mechanism in an actual design.

Also, this code does not require any Verilog simulation tool, can be directly used in a Verilog environment for testing. It's a good practice to include a testbench for verification of the design. If you're a student or a beginner in Verilog, it might be good to start with a more organized design using classes and testbenc
