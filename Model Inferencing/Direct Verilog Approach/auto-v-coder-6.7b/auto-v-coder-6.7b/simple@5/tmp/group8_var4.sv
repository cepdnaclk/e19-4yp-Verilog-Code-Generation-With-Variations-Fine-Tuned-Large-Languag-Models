```verilog
module IR ( input [7:0] data_in, input load, clk,
output reg [7:0] data_out );

reg [1:0] A [0:3];

always @( posedge clk ) begin
  inside1 = (A[0] == 2'b10);
  inside2 = (A[1] == 2'b10);
  inside3 = (A[2] == 2'b10);
  inside4 = (A[3] == 2'b10);
  if ( load && (inside1 || inside2 || inside3 || inside4) ) begin

This code demonstrates the use of a packed vector as one of the multi-dimensional arrays, as well as using an inside operator with a 4D range to determine if the input values should be loaded into `data_out`. The `load` signal determines whether the `data_in` should be loaded into `data_out`. 

Note:
- The inside operator checks if the value of A[i] lies between a certain range. 
- Load signal is high and at least one index of A has a value of 2'b10, then loads `data_in` into `data_out`. 
- Inside operator does not work with unpacked arrays. So, we use packed arrays to match the type of the array index.
- It should be noted that this code is a simplified example and may not meet your specific needs. You may need to adjust the code based on your actual use-case.
