```Verilog
module XOR_Gate(
    input logic [1:0] A [0:3],
    output logic [1:0] Y [0:3]
);
    always @(*) begin
        for(int i = 0; i < 4; i = i + 1) begin
            Y[i] = A[i] ^ 2'b10;
        end
    end
endmodule
```
In the above code, we modified the inputs A from being individual wires to a 1D logic vector array. We then used an inside operator with a 4D range to perform the bitwise XOR operation on all elements of the 1D array. The result is stored in a 1D logic vector array Y. It's worth noting that the operation 2'b10 is applied to all elements of the array, thus performing a bitwise XOR with a binary number '10' for each element (as '10' in binary is 2 in decimal).

This modified code can be synthesized and synthesized Verilog code can be generated. The synthesized Verilog code then can be translated to target hardware (as per the specific target hardware's constraints). The generated Verilog code will have different behaviour as it utilizes the available hardware resources more effectively. 

Remember, the Verilog code above should be synthesizable and synthesized on a target device for it to produce realistic hardware behavior.

Also note, this example assumes that the toolchain used supports the Verilog code and the synthesis tool is correctly configured to generate the correct hardware representation. Without a specific toolchain and synthesis tool in hand, specific behavior cannot be guaranteed. It may also affect the actual hardware performance but it is a good example to understand how multi-dimensional arrays can be manipulated and how the synthesis tool will handle them.```Verilog
