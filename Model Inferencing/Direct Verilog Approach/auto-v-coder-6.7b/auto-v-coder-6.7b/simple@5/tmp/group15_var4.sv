    end

    initial begin
        #1; 
        sw = 'b1000_0000; // negative number
        #1;
        sw = 'b0111_1111; // positive number
        #1;
        sw = 'b1111_1111; // negative number
        #1;

In the code above, I added a new test case where sw is set to a negative number and then reset to a positive number, both in binary format. This will help us test the Verilog module with signed binary numbers.### Note:
The `$monitor` statement in this code is used to display the values of'sw' and 'ld' at each simulation time step. This helps us to easily verify the output of the Verilog code.
The `#1` in the `initial` block is used to introduce a delay of 1 time unit before changing input value of'sw'. This is needed with some simulators, because initial block is executed one time before the simulation starts, which would otherwise affect the output.
The `$finish` statement is at the end of the initial block, which stops the simulation after the last instruction of the initial block. Therefore, it stops the simulation after the last test case is performed, ensuring that all test cases are evaluated.
Additionally, the module is instantiated with the Verilog code, and an initial block is used to drive the input'sw' with a sequence of values. These values are then monitored and the outputs are displayed using `$monitor`. The input values are driven one by one, a delay is introduced, and finally the simulation is stopped.
