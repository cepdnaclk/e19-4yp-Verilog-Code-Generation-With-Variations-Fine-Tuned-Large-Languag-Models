```verilog
module testbench ();
  generate data;
  process data;
  endmodule

  // Include a new struct containing a rand member to test randomization
  struct {
    rand bit [31:0] data; // rand member representing random data 
  } random_struct;

  // Initialize random_struct
  initial begin
    random_struct.data = $urandom();
  end

  // Display the randomized data
  initial begin
    $display("Randomized data: %h", random_struct.data);
  end
endmodule
```

In the modified code, we added a struct with a rand member for generating random data. Inside the initial block, we initialized the random_struct's rand member to a random value with `$urandom()`, which generates a random integer. Then, we display the randomized data using `$display()`. This modification allows for the testing of randomization inside a struct, and provides an example of how rand members can be used in Verilog code.
