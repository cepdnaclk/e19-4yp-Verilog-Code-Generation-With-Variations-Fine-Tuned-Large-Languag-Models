```verilog
module show_aa(ao,ai); // NOT gate with delay 2
  parameter P = 1, Q = 0; // Define enum values
  typedef enum {A=P, B=Q} values_t; // Define enum type
  output ao; input values_t ai; // Use enum type as input
  wire ao;
  not #2 (ao,ai);
endmodule
```
In the modified code, we have used the parameter keyword to define P and Q as the enum values. Then we defined the type values_t as an enum with A and B as its members. The parameter keyword is typically used to define constants that are not meant to be changed.

The output wire ao is not needed to be output here as it is directly used in the NOT gate logic.

The input values_t ai is the enum variable which can take values A or B as it will be assigned to A=P, B=Q in this case.

Note: You should include enum-based types as inputs in a module definition if you want to be able to run your design by using a text editor or a software simulator that can switch value assignments on the fly. However, actual hardware synthesis might not be able to recognize enum-based types and their values.

Also, if you want to run the Verilog code using a hardware simulator, you will need to manually change values of 'ai' in the input monitor of the simulator to observe the effect of changes. 

In a real hardware design, any input that is not driven with known or constant values is usually treated as an uninitialized input, which may lead to synthesis errors depending on the synthesis tool that is used.

Please remember that your simulation environment may not support simulating packed arrays, so you may need to adjust the testbench accordingly if you want to test this code. In general, packed arrays and enum inputs should work well in simulation but not in hardware. This modified code is kept here for informational purposes only. In some specific cases, you may want to consider using packed arrays for an actual hardware design.```verilog
