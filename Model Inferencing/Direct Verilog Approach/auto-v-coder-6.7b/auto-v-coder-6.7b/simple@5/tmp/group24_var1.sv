```verilog
module Anding (packed union {
  bit [1:0] mode;
  bit [1:0] en;
} input u, output y);
and (y, u.mode, u.en);
endmodule
```
In this code, the Anding module takes a packed union as an input. This union contains two modes: en (enable) and mode. The "mode" is a 2-bit wide input, while "en" is a 2-bit wide input as well. This is equivalent to creating a 4-bit wide input for the Anding module.

This way, the width of the input to the module increases without affecting its functionality, as required. It also demonstrates the flexibility of Verilog's union type in modeling complex structures.

Note: This is a very basic example of a union type in Verilog. More complex structures, such as structures or arrays, can also be used in union declarations. Also, the packed keyword is used here to prevent any implicit padding due to widths of the input ports.

Please note that the code provided assumes you are using an up-to-date version of Verilog, as some features used in this code, like the packed union, may not be available in older versions of Verilog. Also, I'm using verilog-mode in Emacs to write the code, so you might need to adjust it to your specific Verilog tool or environment.

Remember to test your designs with the right size of input combinations to cover all edge cases. This modification does not change the functionality of the Anding module, it just allows it to take a larger number of inputs. The module still only performs a bitwise AND operation on the two inputs.

Also note that this code is only synthesizable if the inputs to the Anding module are always valid and do not change values during simulation. If you have unspecified behavior, this code will not synthesize. In such case, you'd need to use a different method to handle unspecified inputs.

Also, in Verilog, input and output ports are not automatically connected to the ports of a module. They need to be connected in the top-level module. The Anding module defined here is not connected to any ports in the top-level module. You need to manually connect the ports of the
