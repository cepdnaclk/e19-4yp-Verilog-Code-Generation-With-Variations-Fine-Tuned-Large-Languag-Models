```verilog
module TestMod ( input logic [1:0] A [0:3], 
                 input logic load, clk,
                 output reg [7:0] B );
                 
// Declare a 1D logic-vector array
logic [7:0] temp [0:3];
                 
// Simple register (Test Register) loaded on posedge clk when load is high
always @( posedge clk )
if ( load ) begin
    for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++)
        temp[i] <= A[i];
    B <= temp[2];
end
endmodule
```

In this code, two dimensions of the array A (size [0:3] and [1:0]) are utilized. The elements A[i] are loaded into the 1D array temp[] using a for loop. The third element of the resulting array is then assigned to output B.

The input A is assumed to be a packed 1D logic-vector array with 4 elements - the first element of A is loaded into temp[0], the second element of A is loaded into temp[1], and so on.

This will work for all Verilog-A compatible simulators and synthesis tools, as it is a simple single-cycle example of how you might use packed arrays and their operation in Verilog. It should help you to understand how you can handle multi-dimensional logics and packed arrays in your design code.

Remember to always make sure that your code is synthesizable and correctly mapped to standard cells in your target technology or FPGA.

Remember that Verilog is case-insensitive. The sensitivity list in the always_ff construct is written in lowercase to avoid any potential issues with Verilog's sensitivity list uppercase sensitivity list behavior. ### End ### Instruction:
The provided code in the variation instructions is an example of Verilog code suitable for simulation and synthesis. It demonstrates the use of packed 1D logic-vector arrays and their interaction with a register, demonstrating a basic multi-dimensional array handling in Verilog.

Here it is:
