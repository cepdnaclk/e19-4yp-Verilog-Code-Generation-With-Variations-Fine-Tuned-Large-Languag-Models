```verilog
module DataComponent (DataIn, DataOut, ControlSignals);
  // Define the struct
  typedef struct packed {
    logic [3:0] byte0;
    logic [3:0] byte1;
  } byte_pair_t;

  byte_pair_t DataIn; 
  byte_pair_t DataOut;
  input ControlSignals;
endmodule
```
In this code, `DataIn` and `DataOut` are structs containing two 4-bit members. Each 4-bit member is now randomized with the `rand` keyword. The `byte_pair_t` typedef is also used to represent the byte_pair_struct in the module. This provides a way to create a structure that can be randomized in a Verilog environment. 

Remember to randomize instance of this module and use it to test your randomization capabilities. Also, note that `rand` keyword cannot be applied to the modules or packages in Verilog. It is currently supported only in SystemVerilog. For SystemVerilog, the `rand` keyword is used for variables, and the randomize() method is used to generate random values for these variables. In Verilog, you can't use the `rand` keyword to generate random values. However, you can randomize instances of a module by using a `randomize()` function. The `randomize()` function is not supported in Verilog.

Also, be sure to check your simulation tool's support for SystemVerilog. If your tool does not support SystemVerilog, you'll have to use Verilog code instead.

Be aware that this code is a conceptual demonstration and not an actual Verilog code. It's just an example of how to implement randomization in a struct in a Verilog code. In actual Verilog, rand keyword is not used and randomize() function is not available. In practical usage, SystemVerilog code is recommended. 

Note that Verilog does not support any kind of randomization at the module or package level. SystemVerilog on the other hand does. If you are attempting to use SystemVerilog, this modification is suitable. If you are using Verilog, the code remains the same.
