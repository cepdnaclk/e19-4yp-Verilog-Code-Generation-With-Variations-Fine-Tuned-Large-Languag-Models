In the modified code, the input vector's base type is changed from logic to byte. This change allows the module to work with byte-type vectors, which are commonly used in the Verilog standard for modeling 8-bit data.

Please replace the `logic` type with `byte` or any other desired base type for a wider range of simulations. This is just an example of how to change the base type in Verilog, and the actual implementation may vary based on the specific requirement.

Keep in mind that this change may not affect functionality but can be beneficial for testing or debugging purposes. Running simulations with different base types can help identify compatibility issues or unexpected behavior.
