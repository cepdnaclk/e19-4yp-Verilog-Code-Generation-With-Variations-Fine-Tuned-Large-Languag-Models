```verilog
module test;
wire a;
typedef struct packed {
    reg x, y, z;
} packed_struct;
packed_struct signals; // packed struct declaration

assign #25 a = 1;
always begin
    signals.x = #10 a;
end
endmodule
```
In this modified code, we've created a packed structure called `packed_struct`. Then, we declare a signal called `signals` of the type `packed_struct`. We use the `.` operator to access its members: `signals.x`, `signals.y`, and `signals.z`. The assign and always block also remain unchanged.

The packed structure ensures that the three signals (x, y, z) are packed in the same place in the signal path, which is useful for reducing resource usage when multiple signals are used in a single path. This modification will also help in making the code more explicit and easy to understand. For example, if you want to change the delay for `signals.x` to `35`, you can do:
```verilog
assign #35 a = 1;
always begin
    #(-30) signals.x = 1; // the timing of y and z will not affect x due to packed structure
end
```
This is a basic example and packed structures are used in hardware design for resource efficiency. They can be used to pack multiple signals into a single wire, bus, or register. In this case, they are used to ensure that the signals' timing constraints are handled correctly.

Please note that packed structs should only be used when the assigned value of a signal is known at compile time. If the value is not known at compile time, it may cause a timing infeasibility or synthesis errors, because Verilog doesn't know the value at compile time. This example should work fine with Quartus Prime or other synthesis tools as they generally support packed structs. However, you need to ensure that your synthesis tool supports packed structs to ensure proper resource usage.

Remember to adapt and understand the example above to your actual use-case scenario. It might even be necessary to consider specific synthesis tools and their limitations when dealing with packed structs. Also, make sure that your synthesis tool can handle this kind of structure and the delays properly, as incorrect
