```systemverilog
module show_aa(ao,ai); // NOT gate with delay 2
  output ao; input ao, ai;
  not #2 (ao,ai);
endmodule
```

In Verilog, you can also use packed enums to represent a set of distinct values. Here's how you might modify the above code to use enums:

```systemverilog
module show_aa(ao,ai); // NOT gate with delay 2
  // Define our packed enum
  typedef enum {A, B, C} packed_enum_t;
  
  // Specify the enum as inputs and outputs
  output packed_enum_t ao; input packed_enum_t ai;
  
  always @(*) begin
    // Enum logic
    case (ai)
    A: ao = B;
    B: ao = A;
    C: ao = C; // To demonstrate default case
    default: ao = A; // Default case
    endcase
  end
endmodule
```

In this example, `packed_enum_t` is a packed enum type with three possibilities: `A`, `B`, and `C`. The always block is a procedural block that assigns the output `ao` based on the input `ai`.

Please, remember to check for enum inputs in your testbench or use a tool to check your enum values. Enum inputs may not always produce expected results, especially in synthesis. Default values can be used to avoid such issues. 

Also, be mindful of synthesis tools' support for packed enums. Some tools might require additional support, or they might not support packed enums at all. In this case, you might need to use other types of logic representation, such as integer or boolean.

Please also note that this is a simple example, and you might need to extend or simplify it for your specific use case. Also, this is not the most "optimized" way to simulate an enum logic. In a real-world project, the enum inputs should ideally be connected to a real-valued input, and the outputs should be converted to the corresponding enum values.
In a real-world project, it's best to use real-valued inputs and outputs; not
