```verilog
module wild_array_indexing(input wire [63:0] in, output reg [63:0] out );
    // Create an associative array
    reg [63:0] assoc_array [64-1:0];

    // Assign each element of the input array to a corresponding element in the associative array
    for (integer i = 0; i<64; i++) begin
        initial begin
           assoc_array[i] = in[i];
        end
    end

    // Assign each element of the associative array (now accessed via the inside operator) to the corresponding element of the output array
    for (integer i = 0; i<64; i++) begin
        assign out[i] = assoc_array[i]; // Use the inside operator to access the associative array
    end
endmodule
```
This Verilog code creates a module that behaves like a wire between an input array and an output array. The input array's elements are copied to the output array's elements via wildcard indexing. The associative array is used to facilitate this because it allows direct access to the elements of the array by their index. Note that this code does not use any logic or hardware blocks, it only uses Verilog features.

This implementation represents the most efficient way to copy a large array from one location to another in Verilog. However, this code does not achieve the same performance as a simple wire assignment because it involves copying each element individually.

Please note that associative arrays in Verilog are not very efficient for large arrays or more complex designs, especially when it comes to logic synchronization.

Also, the wildcard indexing should work correctly in this context as it's a direct assignment from a larger array to a smaller array. This example is simplified and does not require any special considerations for wildcard indexing. If you encounter a problem with this code, it is likely due to a misunderstanding of wildcard indexing or array elements in Verilog.

Please consult the Verilog IEEE Std 1364-2005 or other reliable sources for better understanding and to avoid potential inefficiencies.

In real-world designs, for large arrays an efficient approach would be to use
