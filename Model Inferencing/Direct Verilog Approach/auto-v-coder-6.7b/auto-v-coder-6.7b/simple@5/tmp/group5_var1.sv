```verilog
module tst_dff_pbeh();
  logic di,clk; wire do;
  dff_p d1(do,di,clk); // Instantiate DFF with path delay
  initial begin clk=0; di=1'b0; #35 $stop; end // Initialize & stop
  always #3 clk=~clk; // Generate clock (negedges at 6, 12, 18...)
  always #5 di=~di; // Toggle data
  initial $monitor($time,"clk=%b, di=%b, do=%b",clk,di,do);
endmodule
```

In this code, logic and wire are SystemVerilog types that are equivalent to the Verilog reg and wire. This allows the code to be compatible with different types of simulation tools and environments. 

Note: Verilog and SystemVerilog are not interoperable. If you need to run this code in a Verilog-based tool, you would need to use reg instead of logic. Same applies to case when you need to run in a SystemVerilog-based tool.###

This variation instructs the compiler to use the preferred language-specific types for logic and wire. It is recommended for most projects but might be necessary for specific tool configurations.."[SystemVerilog]:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SystemVerilog
