```verilog
// Create a module with one input and one output that behaves like a wire
module wire_assign( input bit in, output out );
    // assign out to in
    assign out = in;
endmodule
```
This change will allow the usage of SystemVerilog's bit type, a simpler type than wire, that can represent both high (1) and low (0) states. This is especially useful when dealing with Boolean state transitions.

Note: Be cautious when using `bit`. It is generally better to use `wire` type if you are not specifically interested in its bit level behavior. SystemVerilog's `bit` type will allow you to use the same logic operations as SystemVerilog's `integer` type, but it will not allow you to do bit level operations, like bit shifting or masking, unless you explicitly cast it to a `integer` beforehand. This is because bit level operations are not applicable to `bit` type.

Also, `bit` is not fully supported in some tools, like Icarus Verilog or ModelSim, so use it with caution.

Please also note that `bit` is also a keyword in SystemVerilog and you can't use it as a variable or constant name. So you cannot declare a variable or constant as `bit`. Instead, it is reserved for bit type in SystemVerilog.

For your specific use case of 1-bit control signals, a bit is a better choice than a wire because a bit can represent both high and low states while a wire can only represent low (0) and high (1). If you are using a bit as a control signal, you will have to convert it to a wire or integer to get the same behavior as a wire.

For example, changing `wire` to `bit` in the case of a 1-bit control signal would look like this:

```verilog
// Create a module with one input and one output that behaves like a wire
module wire_assign( input in, output out );
    // assign out to in
    assign out = in;
endmodule
```
With this change, `out` will behave just like `in`, and the behavior should be the same regardless of whether `in` is a `wire` or `bit`.
