```verilog
module ALU (output logic signed[3:0] Result, input logic signed[3:0] ArgA, ArgB, input Clk);
specify
    specparam tRise = 5, tFall = 4;
    (Clk *> Result) = (tRise, tFall);
endspecify
endmodule
```
In this code, input ArgA and ArgB are logic signed [3:0] which are used to perform signed arithmetic operations. The output Result is also signed logic [3:0] to match the input size and range. The clock input Clk is also part of the input list.

Please note that logic variables in SystemVerilog are of the type logic and can take the values of 0, 1, x, and z. So, we don't need to specify them explicitly while assigning values to the variables. Similarly, as in the original code, we are assigning the rise and fall times to the clock and result signals.

Also, the ALU module is designed to take 32-bit signed inputs and outputs, but for this variation we are considering the ALU to take 4-bit signed inputs and outputs. This is just a demonstration and will not give the same results as the original code. The actual ALU module must handle arguments of 32-bit size and produce results of 32-bit size for correct behavior.

For a 32-bit ALU, the modified code would be:

```verilog
module ALU (output logic signed[31:0] Result, input logic signed[31:0] ArgA, ArgB, input Clk);
specify
    specparam tRise = 5, tFall = 4;
    (Clk *> Result) = (tRise, tFall);
endspecify
endmodule
```
With this code, the input ArgA and ArgB are always logic signed [31:0] which are used to perform signed arithmetic operations. The output Result is also signed logic [31:0] to match the input size and range. The clock input Clk is also part of the input list. The rise and fall times for the clock and result signals are also assigned in the specify block.

Remember that while this code is synt
