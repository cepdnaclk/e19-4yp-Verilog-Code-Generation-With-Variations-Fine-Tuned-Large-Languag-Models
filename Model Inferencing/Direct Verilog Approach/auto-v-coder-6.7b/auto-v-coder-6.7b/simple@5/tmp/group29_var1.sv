In this modified code, I have replaced the 'a' and 'b' inputs with 'MyClass' objects stored in an associative array. The class 'MyClass' has two inputs ‘a’ and ‘b’. The constructor of the class 'MyClass' is used to initialize these inputs. The 'display' function is then used to print the values of 'a' and 'b'. The testbench checks if the inputs to the class hold appropriate values when the associated outputs are changed.### Note:

This example is meant to demonstrate basic Verilog coding principles, and does not reflect best practices for Verilog coding. Additionally, it does not contain the complete context of the original problem as the original code provided has only a single module and the module only has one instance of the class. For a real-world problem, the class would need to be instantiated multiple times, with different class instances being assigned to different outputs, and the code would need to be more comprehensive. However, I kept this example simple and focused on the basic class and associative array usage for the
