In this modified code, we introduce a new type of data, "state_type", which is defined by bit vector of 2 bit length. The state transitions according the logical operators and the if-else statements of the original code. The z[0] is zn and z[1] is zp in the original code. The result of the output z is dependent on the state of the circuit which will be Z, O, N, and P.###

Please note that this code is an example and does not simulate a MOS transistor behavior. MOS transitors are usually used to implement digital logic, while enums are used to model states and transitions in a sequential logic circuit. For a real-world application, a schematic simulation tool such as LTspice, Icarus Verilog or ngSpice should be used to verify the functionalities and performance of such a hardware model.

Moreover, this code only demonstrates the use of Verilog enums and does not represent the original MOS design. If you need to implement the MOS design, please refer to your hardware description language (HDL) documentation or resources. In this case, you would need to use Verilog (or V
