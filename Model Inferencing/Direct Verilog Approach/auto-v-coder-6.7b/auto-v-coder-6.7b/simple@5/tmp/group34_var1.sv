This modified code demonstrates the usage of associative array with wildcard indexing, where the wildcard key in the associative arrays can be accessed using the wildcard operator '*'. It is a bit complex and it can only be used with indexed associative arrays.

Please note that the module instance is supposed to be declared within the `initial` block. The `always @(*)` block executes every time a change event is detected in the `id` input. Wildcard indexing ensures that the assignment always happens correctly, regardless of the value of `id`.

This approach is especially useful in cases where the index is not known beforehand, such as when implementing a memory with a flexible address space. In this case, the wildcard key allows for an entry in the associative array for each possible index, and the resulting memory can be accessed using the same indexing syntax as before, providing a very flexible way to access memory cells.

The output `out` will always correspond to the value of `data[id]`. This means that if `id` is 0, `out` is always 2'b00. If `id` is 2, `out` is always 2'b10, and so forth. However, the values within `data` can be changed (i.e., `data[0]` and `data[2]` can be updated from 2'b00 and 2'b10, respectively) and the output will be
