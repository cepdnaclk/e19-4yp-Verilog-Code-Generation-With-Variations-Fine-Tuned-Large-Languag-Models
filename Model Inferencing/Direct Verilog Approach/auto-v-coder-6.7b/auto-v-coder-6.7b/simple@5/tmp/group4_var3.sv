```verilog
module testbench ();
struct {
    rand bit [7:0] data;
} structure;

generate begin
    initial begin
        structure.data = $urandom();
    end
end
endmodule
```

In this modified code, we have added a struct containing a randomized bit [7:0] data member. We have then used the generate statement to start a new block where we can place initial statements. The data member of the structure is initialized using the $urandom() function which generates a random value of 8 bits.

This code can be used to test the data member of the structure to see if it is truly random within the range of bit [7:0]. If you run multiple instances of this code, this might be useful in testing the randomness of bit [7:0] type variables. However, without more context, it's hard to say whether this is the best approach for your specific use case. 

Please note that the randomization is done at the initial block level, which means the value of the random variable only gets set once, which may not be what you want in some cases. In such scenarios, you may wish to use the randc initial construct to randomize the variable each time an instance of the module is made.

Also, don't forget to add #(parameter int test_count = 100) after struct and before the instance of the module in the testbench to change the number of test cases, this is just a placeholder and you need to change it according to your specific requirement. #(parameter int test_count = 100)  instructs the simulator to repeat the test_count times.

Lastly, please note that the above is a very basic example and does not include any error checking, assertion, or coverage checks. These should be added in a real scenario for a robust testbench. 

Please note that this code can help you understand how you can generate randomized data inside a struct. It is highly recommended that you read the Verilog LRM (IEEE 1800-2017) or other appropriate sources for information on how to create more complex and efficient testbench. In your case, this is where you can find information on how to use the rand_mode constraints, bitwise operations, and more to achieve your requirements.
