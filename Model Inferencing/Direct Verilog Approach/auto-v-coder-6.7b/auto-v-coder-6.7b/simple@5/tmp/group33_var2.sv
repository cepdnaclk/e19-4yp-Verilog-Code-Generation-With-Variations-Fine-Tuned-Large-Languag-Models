```systemverilog
module ha_1(s,ca,a,b); // Half Adder with gate delays
  parameter delays = {1,2,3,4}; // {xor, xnor, and, or}
  input a,b; output s,ca;
  xor #(delays[0]) (s,a,b);
  and #(delays[1]) (ca,a,b);
endmodule
```
In this modified code, we have replaced the parameterized delays with a packed structure (`delays`) containing delay values. We can now change these delays by simply changing the values in the `delays` array. This approach gives us more flexibility and control over how the delays are applied, and allows us to easily update the delays for different parts of the circuit. This is especially useful when the circuit is being re-designed or when there are specific delay requirements specific to certain parts of the circuit.

Note that the array index corresponds to the gate delay as follows:
0 - xor delay,
1 - xnor delay,
2 - and delay,
3 - or delay

For example, if we want to set the xor delay to 2 and the xnor delay to 1, the `delays` array should be `{2,1,3,4}`.
