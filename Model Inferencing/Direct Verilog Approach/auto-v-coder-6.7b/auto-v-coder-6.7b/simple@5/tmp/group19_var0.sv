```verilog
module dff_inst(D, Clock, Resetn, Q);
input D, Clock, Resetn;
output Q;
lpm_ff flipflop(.data(D),.aclr(Resetn),.clock(Clock),.q(Q));
defparam flipflop.lpm_width = 1;
endmodule
```
### Verilog Testbench:
```verilog
`timescale 1ns / 1ps
module tb_dff_inst;

logic D, Clock, Resetn, Q;

dff_inst U0 (D, Clock, Resetn, Q);

task setup;
begin
    Clock = 0;
    Resetn = 0;
    D = 0;
end
endtask

initial begin
setup();
#5 Resetn <= 1;
#5 D <= 1;
#5 D <= 0;
#5 D <= 1;
#5 D <= 0;
$finish;
end

always #5 Clock = ~Clock;

endmodule
```
### Modified Code Description:
The modified code does not change the functionality of the original D-flip-flop. However, the testbench has been expanded to include dynamic test cases. The initial setup task is used to drive the Resetn and D inputs to their initial value of 0. Then, the D input is driven to take on values 1 and 0, and the testbench is finished after 20 time units. These values are driven due to the use of the `#5` delay operator to achieve the desired effect. The always block that drives the clock is also modified to toggle the clock at each 5 time units, which effectively creates a clock cycle.

In a real-world application, you might use a `for` statement to generate a series of test cases, or a `foreach` loop to iterate over an array to provide the input tests. However, for the purpose of this task, you can use the example provided to see the functionality of the D-flip-flop. 

Remember to replace the `dff_inst` module with your actual design. In this modified code, the `dff_inst` is a placeholder for your actual module
