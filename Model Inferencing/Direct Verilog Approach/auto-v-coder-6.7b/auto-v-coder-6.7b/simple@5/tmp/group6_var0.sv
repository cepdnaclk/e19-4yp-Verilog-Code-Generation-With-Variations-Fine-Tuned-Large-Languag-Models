```verilog
module ALU ( input [7:0] a, b, input pass, add,
output logic[7:0] alu_out );
// Simple combinational ALU
always @(a or b or pass or add)
if (pass) alu_out = a;       // Pass input 'a'
else if (add) alu_out = a + b; // Add inputs 'a' and 'b'
else alu_out = 0;           // Default output is 0
endmodule
```

The `output logic[7:0] alu_out` statement and `always @(a or b or pass or add)` block of the code has not changed. However, the `reg` to `logic` change aligns with modern Verilog practices. The `logic` type is an unsigned data type that can represent values from 0 to 2^n - 1 where n is the width of the logic vector.

Please note that the `logic` keyword is deprecated in SystemVerilog and `logic` and `reg` should be considered as synonymous in System Verilog. They are essentially synonymous and you should use `logic` or `reg` according to the simulation tool you are using. In many simulation tools, `logic` is synonymous with `reg`. However, the use of `logic` is generally recommended as it aligns with Verilog standards and provides benefits like better timing closure and automatic driving of signals.

Finally, please note that the synthesis tool synthesis the `always` block to a flip flop and it's not a good practice to use `output reg` in hardware design, usually `output logic` or `output wire` are used for the output pins in hardware design.

Note: Depending on the tool you are using, `logic` or `reg` could be used. But in general practice, `logic` is used for output signals to maintain good synthesis results. 

Therefore, to align with the recent and widely used practices, it's good idea to use `logic` or `wire` for outputs. But keep in mind that using `reg` for outputs still has its use-cases. For example, in sequential circuits or when you need to drive a signal (like in testbenches). However, always remember to stick to the most common
