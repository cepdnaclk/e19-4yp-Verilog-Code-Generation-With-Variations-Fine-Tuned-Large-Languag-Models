```verilog
module example3(Data, Clock, Reset, RegSum, Sum);
input Clock, Reset;
input [3:0] Data;
output [3:0] Sum, RegSum;
wire [3:0] Sum, RegSum;
reg4 R1 (Sum, Clock, Reset, RegSum);
assign Sum = Data + RegSum;
endmodule
```
### Discussion:
Testing wire-array compatibility is a good way to ensure the code functions as intended and that the output pins produce correct results. However, please note that a wire array is used to represent the output of a circuit, but it does not hold internal states or memories. The output of a module in Verilog is a wire, not an array. Thus, changing a wire (Sum) to a wire array ([3:0]) does not add or subtract data from Sum, it just changes the way Sum is presented. However, you can use the output of Sum for further computation in the same way it was used before.

For instance, if you want to display Sum on LEDs you could do:
```verilog
assign {LED1, LED2, LED3, LED4} = Sum;
```
This would assign each bit of Sum to a separate LED.

The overall purpose of this modification is to provide a direct feedback to verify if the design is capable of performing the desired function, including verifying the output pin compatibility with wire-array assignments. So, this code may not be suitable for all purposes and should be used judiciously.
