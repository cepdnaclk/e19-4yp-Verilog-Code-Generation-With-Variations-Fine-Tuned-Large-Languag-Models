```verilog
module Half_Adder(
    input logic A, B,
    output logic [7:0] Sum, Carry
);
    assign Sum = {A ^ B, 7'b0};
    assign Carry = {A & B, 6'b0, 1'b0};
endmodule
```
In this code, we have defined the output type as logic [7:0] for both the Sum and Carry. This is a common practice to define the output type as logic [3:0] for 4 bit signals, logic [7:0] for 8 bit signals etc. This helps to align with standard signal declarations and improve code readability. The output values are constructed by concatenating the required bits. The unused bits are filled with either '0' or 'z'.

Note that the output values are constructed this way due to limitations in the Verilog syntax. In most cases, these types of assignments work fine but you might need to handle the unused bits manually in simulation or synthesis if you are not using them. 

Also note that this code does not actually perform arithmetic operations on two bits, it performs a half adder operation. As such, the unused bits in the output values are not used for the purpose of arithmetic operations and so are always '0'. However, they can be useful in other scenarios such as outputting status signals. In this case, the unused bits in the Carry output are unused, so they are always '0'.

In summary, the modified code aligns with the common practice of using a standard sized vector for an output signal and fills unused bits with '0' in order to maintain some consistency and code readability, while still achieving the desired functionality of a half adder.```verilog
module Half_Adder(
    input logic A, B,
    output logic [7:0] Sum, Carry
);
    assign Sum = {A ^ B, 7'b0};
    assign Carry = {A & B, 6'b0, 1'b0};
endmodule
