```verilog
module ALU (output[31:0] Result, input[31:0] ArgA, ArgB, input Clk);
specify
    specparam tRise = 5, tFall = 4;
    (Clk *> Result) = (tRise, tFall);
    (ArgA => ArgB) = (5, 5); // ArgA affects ArgB (or ArgB depends on ArgA)
    (ArgA => Result) = (5, 5); // ArgA affects Result
    (ArgB => Result) = (5, 5); // ArgB affects Result
endspecify
endmodule
```
The inputs ArgA, ArgB and Result are now signed logic vectors of 31 bits. This code demonstrates how you can specify delays for certain signals in a Verilog system, but it is not recommended for real use due to its complexity and limited use-cases. It's important to note that Verilog delays are generally not used for system simulation and synthesis, and are best for design considerations. The standard practice is to model the latency and timing requirements of your design in your testbench/synthesis tool. In this case, the verilog code specified will have no effect on the actual simulated/synthesized hardware.

Please note: Specifying delays for signals in Verilog is often used for timing analysis and not for modeling the actual hardware timings. This is why it is important to use a tool like Cadence's Spectre or Xilinx's Timing Analyser or other similar tools for designing with Verilog code that has timing specifications. In these tools, you can simulate a system and generate a timing report to show how the timing works under certain conditions or for certain test cases. It is not used to represent hardware design intent.

Here is the original base code:

```verilog
module ALU (output[31:0] Result, input[31:0] ArgA, ArgB, input Clk);
endmodule
```

You would use this code to model an ALU operation in Verilog. The `Result` output is the result of an operation performed on the inputs `ArgA` and `ArgB`. The `Clk` input is a clock signal, and it could be used to
