```verilog
module testbench ();
generate
    struct {
        rand bit [7:0] rand_val;
    } test_struct;

    initial begin
        test_struct.rand_val = 8'hAA; // Set initial value
        $display("Initial rand_val = %h", test_struct.rand_val);

        // Randomize
        void'(test_struct.rand_val.randomize());
        $display("Randomized rand_val = %h", test_struct.rand_val);
    end
endgenerate
endmodule
```
In this modified version, we define a struct consisting of a bit vector rand_val. In the initial block, we set its initial value to `8'hAA` and then randomize it. Upon randomization, we display both the initial and randomized values.

Please note that to use `randomize()` method, you need to import `uvm_pkg::*` into your testbench file. Also, the randomize function in SystemVerilog returns a status value indicating whether the operation was successful. In this code, the `void'` prefix is used to ignore the return value of `test_struct.rand_val.randomize()`. This is done because we do not use the return value in this context. So, the call can be considered as non-blocking.

This code snippet also assumes that you've set up a UVM environment. This environment is required to use the `randomize()` function. However, if you're not using UVM in your project, you can use the SystemVerilog `randomize()` function directly.

This is a basic example of how to use SystemVerilog's randomize function, it's a powerful tool that can be used to generate randomized values in your verilog code. It can be used for a variety of tasks, from setting initial values, generating random conditions, to generating test input patterns.

Remember, `randomize` method is a blocking method, you need to wait for return value in your application. If you are sure that your randomize functions are non-blocking, you can use `void'(randomize() )`.

Also, keep in mind that using `rand` keyword is a good practice and it helps
