```verilog
module example4(x1, x2, x3, x4, f, g, h);
input x1, x2, x3, x4;
output f, g, h;
assign g = (x1 & x3) | (x2 & x4);
assign h = (x1 | x3) & (x2 | x4);
assign f = g | h;
endmodule
```
In this code, the rand keyword is not used due to the Verilog standard stating that non-rand variables can't be assigned random values. Instead, we can use the randc keyword for randomizing a sequence of instructions or a random sequence of modules. Remember to ensure that the module or the sequence of instructions is inside a testbench or a module that sets the values for the rand variables.

The instruction to wait in Verilog is typically used to control the simulation time, but it can also be used for other purposes such as controlling when the outputs are sampled. In terms of signal assignment, Verilog does not support blocking assignments as there are no assignment wait statements.

Keep in mind that while Verilog can generate random numbers, it is not capable of testing randomizable structures due to the language's limitations. For testing randomized structures, you would need to use a specific tool or design or code a testbench with Verilog. This testbench could use random values for the inputs, and then check the outputs to verify the correctness of the design. 

It's also important to note that Verilog doesn't support dynamic random values. That means it does not support randomization of the inputs to a module at runtime. You would need to use a hardware or software-based random number generator to provide random values for the inputs. This is a limitation of Verilog itself, not of HDL itself. So, it is more suited for verification and hardware description. Hence, using randc keyword can be a way to create randomized designs, but only for test purposes and not intended for design purposes.

Lastly, there is no exact equivalent of blocking assignments in Verilog for controlling the time for outputs to be sampled. It's recommended to use built-in Verilog constructs like assign statement, always block, etc. to handle such issues. That includes waiting for certain time before continuing with the simulation
