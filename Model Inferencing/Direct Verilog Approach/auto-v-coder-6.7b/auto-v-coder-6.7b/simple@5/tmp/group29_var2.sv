```verilog
module SchedDelayA;
reg a, b;
class RegClass;
  reg regField;
  function new(reg regField);
    this.regField = regField;
  endfunction
endclass

RegClass r[2];
initial begin
  r[0] = new(1'b0);
  r[1] = new(1'b1);
end
always @(r[1].regField) a = r[1].regField;
always @(a) #1000 r[0].regField <= a;
endmodule
```

This code creates two objects of class RegClass each representing a register. The first object, r[0], is assigned an initial value of 0. The second object, r[1], is assigned an initial value of 1. The always block monitors the `regField` of r[1] and assigns its value to `a`. 

An always block monitors `a` and upon changing its value, the `regField` of r[0] is updated with `a`'s value. The delay of 1000 nano seconds is added to make sure the change in `a` is reflected in `regField` at least 1000 nano seconds after the change in `a`. 

Note: This code is a simple example and will not simulate in a real environment. Please make sure that your design is capable of real time simulation.

Also, Verilog does not support associative arrays for class objects directly, so we need to create a class that stores the regField and then use the class objects to store the regField values in an array.

This variation is a demonstration of how one can use class handles within Verilog for more complex simulations. The original example used simple registers, whereas this example used class objects to simulate multi-bit (register field) objects. This type of simulation is useful when you want to simulate complex system behavior, such as register fields within a larger system.```verilog
module SchedDelayA;
reg a, b;
class RegClass;
  reg regField;
  function new(reg regField);
    this.regField = regField;
  endfunction
