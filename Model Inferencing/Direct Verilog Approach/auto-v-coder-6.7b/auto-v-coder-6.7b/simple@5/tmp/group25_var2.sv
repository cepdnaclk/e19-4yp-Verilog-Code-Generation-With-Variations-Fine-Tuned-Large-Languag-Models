```verilog
`timescale 1ns / 1ps
`include "prim_util_pkg.sv"
`include "prim_assert_pkg.sv"

module mos_strength (a, c, zn, zp);
input a, c;
output zn, zp;

enum {Z, ST0, ST1} state;

always @(a or c) begin
    if (a) begin
        if (c) begin
            state <= ST0;
        end else begin
            state <= ST1;
        end
    end else begin
        state <= ST1;
    end
end

assign zn = (state == ST0);
assign zp = (state == ST1);

endmodule
```
In this modified code, we defined an enum `state` with values `Z`, `ST0` and `ST1`. The logic of the module has been modified to use enum values instead of xor and and expressions.

You can now instantiate and test this module in a testbench by passing different inputs to `a` and `c`. The output `zn` and `zp` should follow the output logic from the original code.

Note: This code assumes `prim_util_pkg.sv` and `prim_assert_pkg.sv` are included in the same directory as the verilog file.


Also, this is a purely combinational Verilog, meaning the logic in this code only follows the inputs and does not have any states that change over time. You should be careful when writing such a module since the output does not depend on changing inputs. If you want to modify the module to have a clock and state changes (like a FSM), you may need to use additional Verilog language features such as `always @(posedge clk)` or `always @(*)`.

And a final note: You should also handle reset (`zn` and `zp` should be high when the input `c` is 0. In this case, you would need to define and use a reset signal as well, which is out of the scope of this modified code).

Testbench:

`timescale 1ns / 1ps
`include "mos_strength
