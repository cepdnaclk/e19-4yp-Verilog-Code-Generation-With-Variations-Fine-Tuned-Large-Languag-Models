```SystemVerilog
module Problem1(input logic [3:0] a, b, output logic [3:0] sum);
  assign sum = a + b;
endmodule
```

This code effectively replicates the base Verilog code, but with the SystemVerilog types. The logic type in SystemVerilog is used to represent the same logic as a reg in Verilog. This code will be compatible with a Verilog simulator, but should run correctly in a SystemVerilog simulator.

Please note that using logic is a more flexible type than using reg, and it should be used when the design is being synthesized in a target where there is no equivalent to Verilog's reg. In this case, it's a good idea to use logic for compatibility with SystemVerilog. However, it's generally recommended to use reg for Verilog compatibility. In SystemVerilog, logic is the recommended type for logic gates, and reg is recommended for memory elements. So be aware of which type is being used when you switch to SystemVerilog. If you aren't sure, it's recommended to use logic or reg for Verilog and logic for SystemVerilog.```SystemVerilog

  assign sum = a + b;
