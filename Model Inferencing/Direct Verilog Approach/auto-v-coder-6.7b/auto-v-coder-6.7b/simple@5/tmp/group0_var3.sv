```
module wire_assign( input bit in, output bit out );
    // assign out to in
    assign out = in;
endmodule
```
Bit types in SystemVerilog are used to represent binary values (0 or 1) and they have a similar functionality to Verilog wires.

The changes made are:
- Changed the input to be a bit data type.
- Changed the output to be a bit data type as well.

This change allows for direct binary assignment between the inputs and outputs, similar to a wire in Verilog. Note however, that Verilog does not have a built-in boolean type (like SystemVerilog bit), so this is not a fundamental change.

The code remains the same functionality-wise as it simply assigns the value of the input to the output. It's a test and won't affect the actual behavior of the module.### Base SystemVerilog Code:
```
module wire_assign( input in, output out );
    // assign out to in
    assign out = in;
endmodule
```
This is a simple module that acts as a wire. It takes a single input and a single output, and assigns the value of the input to the output. It can be used to connect a wire in Verilog to a net in SystemVerilog, assuming that the type of the net matches the type of the wire.

This code is for the SystemVerilog version of Verilog. The changes made to the code were purely for experimental or test purposes, and haven't been incorporated into the standard Verilog.

This code essentially does the same thing as in the base Verilog code (and is essentially just a bit more verbose) but it still behaves like a wire for most purposes.### 

The code remains unchanged. 

The changes made were simply for the purpose of learning about the bit data type and its usage in SystemVerilog, and were not necessary for the functionality of the code as it currently stands. It can be used as is and won't affect the functionality of the module.###
