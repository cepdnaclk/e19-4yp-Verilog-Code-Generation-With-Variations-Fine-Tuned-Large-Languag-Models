```verilog
module gade(a,a1,b,c,b1,c1);
input b,c,b1,c1;
output a,a1;
wire a,a1;
// Instantiate OR gate with inertial delay 3
or #3 gg1(a1,c1,b1);
// Instantiate AND gate with rise=2, fall=1 inertial delay
and #(2,1) gg2(a,c,b);
endmodule

module gade_unpacked(a,a1,b,c,b1,c1);
input b,c,b1,c1;
output logic [0:0] a,a1;
// Instantiate OR gate with inertial delay 3
or #3 gg1(a1[0],c1,b1);
// Instantiate AND gate with rise=2, fall=1 inertial delay
and #(2,1) gg2(a[0],c,b);
endmodule
```

This code demonstrates the use of different modes for the `output` and `output logic` keywords. The `output` keyword causes the module instance to generate wires that can be connected to in the design, while the `output logic` keyword means the module instance generates logic primitives that can be connected to in the design.

The two test bench scripts will be similar to the original code, except that the output of the nested structure will be connected to different signals. 

The test bench script for the original code will look like:
```verilog
module tb;
logic a, a1, b, c, b1, c1;
gade uut(a, a1, b, c, b1, c1);
initial begin
        b = 0;
        c = 0;
        b1 = 0;
        c1 = 0;
        #1
        b = 1;
        #1
        c = 1;
        #1
        b1 = 1;
        #1
        c1 = 1;
        #1
        $finish;
end
endmodule
```

The test bench script for the modified version of the code will look like
