```
module AndOr (output X, Y, input bit A, B, C);
assign #10 X = A & B;
assign #10 Y = B | C;
endmodule
```
In this code, we changed the type of the input from wire to bit. This is a SystemVerilog-only feature. It allows us to use bit-wise operations such as &, |, ^ etc. with bit data types, which is not available in Verilog.

Please note that bit is a synonym for logic, and there is no bit data type in Verilog, as there is in SystemVerilog. For example, in Verilog, you cannot write `bit [3:0] x;`. However, in SystemVerilog, `logic [3:0] x;` and `bit [3:0] x;` are both valid and do not conflict. In this variation, I replaced the bit with logic, which could work in Verilog as well. But in SystemVerilog, bit type is available and it is recommended to use bit data type.

One can use it accordingly in SystemVerilog as bit represents a single bit value whereas logic represents a single bit value or vector of bit values. The bit data type is a synonym of logic in SystemVerilog. 

In general, the best practice is to use bit in SystemVerilog for simple logic operations and logic vectors, and use logic in other contexts, as it is more explicit and better documented. However, the use of bit type was widely supported in Verilog and should be used judiciously, so it is recommended to use logic for general use. 

The use of bit in Verilog depends on the specific context and should be avoided unless there is a specific need to do so. In general, logic is recommended for all tasks that do not require bit-level operations. 

For example, in a module like the one above, which uses wire, the code is not affected. But, in the case of a module where bit is used extensively (for example, a FSM), it is worth noting the use of bit data type for better code understanding and avoiding conflicts.```
