```verilog
module gade(
    a, a1,
    output_struct.b, output_struct.c,
    output_struct1.b1, output_struct1.c1
);
input output_struct.b, output_struct.c, output_struct1.b1, output_struct1.c1;
output a, a1;
// Instantiate OR gate with inertial delay 3
or #3 gg1(a1, output_struct1.c1, output_struct1.b1);
// Instantiate AND gate with rise=2, fall=1 inertial delay
and #(2,1) gg2(a, output_struct.c, output_struct.b);
endmodule
```

This code will create a module named `gade` that takes 4 inputs and 2 outputs. The last two inputs are connected to the same output, and the first two inputs are connected to the same output, testing the ability to handle nested unpacked structures.

Note: The unpacked structs syntax is not completely defined yet, so the use of this feature might not be supported by all simulators. This code should be adapted to simulation tools accordingly. 

Also, remember that verilog syntax supports structural coding and behavioral coding, but this code uses structural coding, which is more common and easier to understand. Behavioral coding, where the behavior of the design is defined using behavioral primitives like `and` and `or`, is typically used in case of advanced signal processing, system design, FPGA programming or when the design architecture is such that behavioral modeling is not needed. However, this code can be converted into behavioral modeling easily by using behavioral primitives like `and` and `or`. 

This behavioral modeling approach is typically more suited for hardware design verification where the verification can be done at the level of gate level modeling and behavioral modeling. It helps in achieving a detailed and accurate design verification. However, if the design is to be synthesized, this kind of modeling is not feasible. Hence, the choice of coding approach will depend on the nature of the design, its complexity, the tools being used, the verification level, etc. 

Also, note that this modified code assumes that the names of the inputs and outputs are provided
