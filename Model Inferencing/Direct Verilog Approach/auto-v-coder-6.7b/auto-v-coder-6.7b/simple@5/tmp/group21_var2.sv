```verilog
interface rand_intf(input bit x1, x2, x3, x4);
  logic f, g, h;
  rand bit [1:0] rand_var;
  
  constraint const_for_rand_var {
    rand_var inside {2'b00, 2'b01, 2'b10, 2'b11};
  }

  always_comb begin
    g = (x1 & x3) | (x2 & x4);
    h = (x1 | x3) & (x2 | x4);
    f = g | h;
  end
endinterface

module example4(rand_intf intf);

  assign intf.f = intf.g | intf.h;
  
endmodule
```
This code snippet introduces a random variable `rand_var` of type `bit [1:0]`. The constraint `const_for_rand_var` is used to specify a set of possible values for `rand_var`. In the `always_comb` block, the signal assignments for `g`, `h`, and `f` are performed based on the values of `x1`, `x2`, `x3`, and `x4`. This code demonstrates how to use a randomizable interface in a Verilog module. Please note that the rand_intf is instantiated in other module example5 as an example:
```verilog
module example5(x1, x2, x3, x4, f);
  input x1, x2, x3, x4;
  output f;
  rand_intf intf(x1, x2, x3, x4);
  assign f = intf.f;
endmodule
```
The `example5` module can then be instantiated and connected to a clock to test the behavior of the `rand_intf`. It is important to note that using rand variables within a module is not a recommended practice, and it should be done with caution. It is often better to use rand variables in a testbench to generate random stimulus. In this case, we use rand variables to demonstrate the
