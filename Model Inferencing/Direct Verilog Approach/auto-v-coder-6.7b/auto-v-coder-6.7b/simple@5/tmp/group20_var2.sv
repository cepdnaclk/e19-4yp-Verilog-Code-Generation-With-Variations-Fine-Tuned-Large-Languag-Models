```verilog
module latch (input d, c, output reg q, q_b );

typedef union packed {
  logic [7:0] a;
  logic [3:0] b;
} my_union;

my_union u;

always begin
  wait ( c );
  u.b = ~u.b;
  q = u.a[0];
  q_b = u.a[1];
end

endmodule
```
In this code, the output q and q_b are not declared separately, but both are derived from the packed union u. The value of u.b is inverted at each clock cycle until the next cycle when the value of u.a is then extracted and assigned to q and q_b. The size of the packed union has been set to 8 bits for demonstration and can be adjusted according to the needs. 

Also, note that the order of assignment for q and q_b, which is `q = u.a[0]; q_b = u.a[1];`, is arbitrary and can be changed as per the requirements. The code above is just an example to illustrate how to use union types in Verilog.

Please note that Verilog union types are typically used for bit manipulation in buses or for data types that are accessed by address or name, but this code might be hard to understand if you haven't seen Union types before. The actual use will depend on the desired functionality of the module.

Remember, union types are not recommended for general use, but they provide a way to manually control the interpretation of the bit vector.### In the original code, only q (bit 0) and q_b (bit 1) were output, but in the modified code, q and q_b are assigned values from the union u. The output of q_b (bit 1) is dependent on the output of the original q (bit 0). Since the bit 0 and bit 1 of a byte are swapped each clock cycle, this code might not behave as expected or might not produce meaningful results for a lot of use-cases.### 

In conclusion, the original code is correct and does not need any modifications, but the concept of using union types in Verilog is interesting and can be useful in specialized scenarios where bit level
