```verilog
module latch (input d, c, output reg q, q_b );

typedef union packed {
logic [7:0] val8;
logic [15:0] val16;
} union_t;

union_t data;

always begin
wait ( c );
data.val8 = d;
q_b <= data.val16[8];
q <= data.val8;
end
endmodule
```
In this variation, the output is a packed union. This means that the entire union is 16 bits wide, which can accommodate a 16-bit value or an 8-bit value. The `val8` field holds the 8 bits, and the `val16` field holds the 16 bits. The `q` and `q_b` outputs are set to the 8-bit and 16-bit values, respectively. This should allow you to test the use of a union-based output in Verilog.### Note:
This example assumes the input is a 1-bit signal and is used as the clock. If you are using a different clock input, you should adjust the `wait` statement accordingly. Also, you should specify the exact type of your inputs and outputs in order to get proper Verilog synthesis without any errors.

It's also important to note that this variation might not be synthesizable and might have other limitations, depending on the specific synthesizer you are using. Please refer to your synthesizer's documentation for details.

This variation is an example of using union with Verilog. In a real-world scenario, you would use a Verilog-defined object (`reg`, `wire`, `logic`) in your module. But the principle is to understand first the basics of Verilog before moving forward.### Disclaimer:
This code is for educational purposes to test the concept of the union type in Verilog. It may not work as expected or might not run correctly, if you are not aware of the limitations or potential issues. Use it at your own risk.### Testing:
You can test this code using a simulator like ModelSim or Icarus Verilog to verify its operation. Be sure to set the inputs and check the outputs.
