// Define a packed structure
typedef struct packed {
  logic x;
  logic y;
  logic z;
} packed_struct_t;

// Declare a packed structure instance
packed_struct_t packed_struct;

always_comb begin
  packed_struct.x = a[0];
  packed_struct.y = b[0];

```
In this modified code, we first define a packed structure `packed_struct_t` that includes the signals `x`, `y`, and `z`. We declare an instance of the packed structure `packed_struct`. In the always block, we assign the least significant bits of `a` and `b` to `x` and `y` respectively. We then assign a bitwise XOR operation of `x` and `y` to the first bit of the output `diff`. 

This allows us to test the packed structure handling without the need for regs. Note that the bitwise XOR operation is used for illustration purposes; you can replace it with any other bitwise or arithmetic operation as per your requirement. Also, the use of packed structures here is just for illustrative purposes; in a real world scenario, you would not use packed structures to pass multiple bits between modules, but instead use a separate wire or reg for each bit.```verilog
