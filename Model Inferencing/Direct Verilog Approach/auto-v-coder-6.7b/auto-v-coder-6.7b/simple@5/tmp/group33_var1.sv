```verilog
module ha_1(s,ca,a,b); // Half Adder with gate delays
  typedef struct {
    int delayXOR;
    int delayAND;
  } GateDelay;

  input a,b;
  output s,ca;
  
  GateDelay delayParams;
  assign delayParams.delayXOR = 1;
  assign delayParams.delayAND = 2;
  
  xor #(delayParams.delayXOR) (s,a,b);
  and #(delayParams.delayAND) (ca,a,b);
endmodule
```
In the provided modified code, the structure `GateDelay` is defined to store the parameterized delays. The assignments to `delayParams.delayXOR` and `delayParams.delayAND` ensure the delay values are dynamic and can be varied at runtime. In this way, the gate delays are decoupled from the module definition, making it easier to change or fine-tune the delay values as needed.
