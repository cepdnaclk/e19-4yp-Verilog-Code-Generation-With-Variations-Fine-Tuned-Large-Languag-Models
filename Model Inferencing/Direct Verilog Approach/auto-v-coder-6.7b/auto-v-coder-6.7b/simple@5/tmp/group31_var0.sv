```systemverilog
module func1(x1, x2, x3, f);
input x1, x2, x3;
output logic signed [1:0] f; // Changed the output type to logic signed
assign f = (~x1 & ~x2 & x3) | (~x1 & x2 & ~x3) | (x1 & ~x2 & x3) | (x1 & x2 & ~x3);
endmodule
```

This modified code includes logic signed type for the output f. The output data width is set to 2 bits for signed logic vectors. This way, the output of the function can be either -2, -1, 0, 1, or 2 based on the inputs x1, x2, x3. The assign statement is used to connect the output to a Boolean expression involving the inputs. The output will evaluate as true if the expression is 1, and false otherwise.

Please replace the output width [1:0] as per your requirement. The logic signed [1:0] is used here for simplicity. In general, you can use logic signed [width-1:0] to define signed logic vectors. The width parameter should be the largest possible value the output may take. It should also be noted that the range specified for the output width should be consistent with the expression used in the assign statement. In this case, the output may be -2, -1, 0, 1, or 2. 

The signed value 2 is represented as 2'b10, -2 as 2'b10 and so on. So, assigning 2'b10 to the output works fine. However, assigning 2'b01 would be incorrect because the maximum unsigned value in a 2 bits wide unsigned vector is 2'b11. The exact answer depends on the Boolean expression you are using in the assign statement. If the expression results in values outside the range of the logic signed [1:0] type, you will need to adjust the width parameters accordingly.
