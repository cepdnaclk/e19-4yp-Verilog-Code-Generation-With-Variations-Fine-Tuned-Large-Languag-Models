```v
module Anding (input a, b, output y);
and (y, a, b);
endmodule

module PackedUnionTest (output y);
typedef union packed {
  logic [3:0] a;
  logic [7:0] b;

packed_union pu;

assign pu.a[1:0] = pu.b[7:6];

assign y = pu.a[1];
endmodule
```
In this code, `PackedUnionTest` instantiates the `Anding` module, but instead of using 2-bit wide inputs, it uses 4-bit and 8-bit packed union inputs.

`packed_union` is a user-defined structure, which includes two fields: a 4-bit and a 8-bit field. `pu` is an instance of this structure.

`assign pu.a[1:0] = pu.b[7:6];` line demonstrates how you can assign to a part of one member of the union from another member.

The output of the `PackedUnionTest` module is connected to the `y` output of the `Anding` module. This is to ensure the instantiation is successfully tested.

This code demonstrates the handling of packed union in module ports, but it's not a commonly used technique because packed unions are typically used inside structures and classes, which are more common in Verilog programming. Also, the exact implementation details may vary depending on your particular Verilog simulation tool and synthesis tool. It's usually recommended to use specific data types and structures, and not rely on packed unions for such purposes. 

Note: Verilog standard does not allow direct assignments between unions. Direct assignments like `pu.a[0] = pu.b[0]`; are not allowed in Verilog. They can only be done in procedural assignments or in initial blocks.

Please modify according to your Verilog standards and tool compatibility.

Also, the exact behavior and use cases of packed union type in Verilog can vary based on context, and might not be the same across different Verilog simulators or synthesis tools. Using packed union for such purpose can be a good learning experience, but it's not
