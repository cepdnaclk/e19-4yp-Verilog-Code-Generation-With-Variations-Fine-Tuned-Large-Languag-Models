```
module test;
wire a;
reg [2:0] packed_signals;
assign #25 a = 1;
always begin
    packed_signals[2:0] = {1'b0, a, a};
end
endmodule
```
In this modified code, a packed structure is used to encapsulate the signals x, y, and z. The assignment is modified to use the packed structure in order to test how the packed structure handles delay. Note that this code does not explicitly declare x, y, or z.

Testing the packed structure to handle delays would involve delaying and assigning the value of a to the packed structure. This code assigns a and a to the packed structure, but it would work similarly with signals that are more complex.

Remember to include the appropriate delays in your delaying assignments or using the delay keyword in your assignment based on your specific use case.

Also, since packed structure does not have a separate name, the order of the signals is determined by their order in the declaration. In this code, a is the most significant bit (MSBit) and x, y, and z are placed in the order they are declared. Please modify the code as per your requirements.

The code can be used as is but remember to adjust the delay periods or other aspects based on your specific use case.!
