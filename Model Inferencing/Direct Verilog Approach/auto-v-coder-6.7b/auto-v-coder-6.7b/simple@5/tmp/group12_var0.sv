```v
module Problem1(input logic [3:0] a, b, output logic [3:0] sum);
  assign sum = a + b;
endmodule
```
This code is a simple addition module in SystemVerilog. It takes two 4-bit inputs and gives an output that is the sum of the inputs. The input declaration uses the logic keyword instead of the reg keyword, which is an alternative syntax in SystemVerilog to declare wires and registers. 

The logic type has some notable differences from reg in SystemVerilog compared to Verilog. For example, logic types have a greater range of values, and they can also participate in arithmetic operations without needing explicit casting. 

It should also be noted that there is no need to declare the a and b ports as inputs since SystemVerilog can infer the direction of ports based on the type of the declaration (input, output, inout). In this specific example, we have not declared a and b as outputs, so they are considered inputs by default. 

If the direction of ports is not inferred correctly, it can be specified in the port declaration using the input or output keyword. For example:
```v
module Problem1(input [3:0] a, output [3:0] sum);
  assign sum = a + 5;
endmodule
```
This code has the same functionality as the original code, but the direction of the ports is explicitly declared. In this case, a is an input and sum is an output. In general, this can be used when the direction of ports needs to be explicitly specified for some specific behavior. 

Overall, using logic types instead of reg is a more modern and common way to declare wires and registers in SystemVerilog. It provides greater flexibility, more readability, and can be used in more complex designs. However, the choice of whether to use logic or reg depends on the specific requirements of the design. In many cases, the choice between reg and logic will not make a significant difference, but they can be useful in specific situations. For example, using logic allows for the use of combinational logic without needing to make the logic explicit with a `always` block in a `begin...end` block. In simpler designs, using reg may be more straightforward due to the simpler syntax and semantics of the language.
