```verilog
module tst_dff_pbeh();
  logic di,clk; wire do;
  dff_p d1(do,di,clk); // Instantiate DFF with path delay
  initial begin clk=0; di=1'b0; #35 $stop; end // Initialize & stop
  always #3 clk=~clk; // Generate clock (negedges at 6, 12, 18...)
  always #5 di=~di; // Toggle data
  initial $monitor($time,"clk=%b, di=%b, do=%b",clk,di,do);
endmodule
```
This should now run with the same behavior in both Verilog and SystemVerilog. If the behavior changes, it's because the testbench or the dff_p module itself is incompatible with SystemVerilog types. In such cases, you would need to revisit your code to ensure it complies with SystemVerilog rules.
