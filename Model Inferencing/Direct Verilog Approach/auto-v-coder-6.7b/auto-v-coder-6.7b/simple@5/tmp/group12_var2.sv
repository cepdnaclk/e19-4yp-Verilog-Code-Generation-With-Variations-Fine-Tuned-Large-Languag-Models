```verilog
module Problem1(
    input [3:0] a,
    input [3:0] b,
    output logic [3:0] sum
);

    always_comb begin
        sum = a + b;
    end

endmodule
```
This code is essentially the same as the original, but it makes use of the `logic` type instead of `reg` (SystemVerilog) to declare internal signals. This allows for compatibility with SystemVerilog environments. Note that logic can represent both high and low potentials but it is not a register type. In contrast, reg is an actual flip-flop type that holds a value and changes it over time.

For more formal testing, use a testbench. Here's a basic testbench that can be used to verify this module:

```verilog
module Problem1_tb;

    logic [3:0] a, b;
    logic [3:0] sum;

    Problem1 uut (
       .a(a),
       .b(b),
       .sum(sum)
    );

    initial begin
        $dumpfile("dump.vcd");
        $dumpvars(0, Problem1_tb);

        #10;
        a = 4'h2; // binary 2
        b = 4'h3; // binary 3
        #10;
        assert(sum==4'h5) else $error("Assertion failed!");
    end
endmodule
```
This testbench initializes the inputs a and b and then checks the output sum, expecting it to be equal to 2+3=5. In case the assertion fails (because sum does not equal 5), it will print an error message.

For this testbench to work, you must compile the design (`Problem1`) and the testbench (`Problem1_tb`) into a single simulation file and simulate it. You may need to add your testbench to your synthesis or implementation flow.

When you run the simulation, the output will be dumped to `dump.vcd`, which you can then view in tools like GTKWave or a web service like waves.opensource.org. This file will show the internal signals of the `Problem
