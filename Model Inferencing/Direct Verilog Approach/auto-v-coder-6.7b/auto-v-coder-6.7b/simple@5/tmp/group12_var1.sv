```systemverilog
module Problem1(input logic [3:0] a, b, output logic [3:0] sum);
  assign sum = a + b;
endmodule
```
In the base Verilog code, the reg declarations for di and clk are declared with logic type. However, if you want to test this code in a SystemVerilog environment, you need to modify the logic declarations to reg. However, in SystemVerilog, the logic type is the default type for variables and it can be omitted when declaring variables.

So, in this modified code, both the logic and reg type declarations for a and b are removed and only the output logic type is left. This code will work in both Verilog and SystemVerilog environments, but the logic type will be used in Verilog and SystemVerilog types will be used in SystemVerilog. 

In this solution, we are just showing how to handle varying environment syntaxes. The actual logic of the code remains the same, which is to add two 4-bit numbers. If you want to stick with logic type for all environments, you could just remove the wire declarations and rely on the default logic type. However, this approach is not recommended for production code for Verilog and SystemVerilog environments, where the logic type is the default type. The example provided here is just for demonstration purposes.

Please note that the logic type in SystemVerilog is mostly used for signals that are going to be driven by an assingment statement, and not for pure combinational logic or variables that are not going to be changed within the module. Logic in SystemVerilog signifies the combinational logic.

So, in this case, if you want to make the code compatible with both Verilog and SystemVerilog, you should consider removing the wire declarations and rely on the default logic type. 

However, it's good practice to write your code in a manner that it can be verified in both versions. In most cases, you should consider a design that can be inferred to be the same in both languages.

Remember to test this code in the actual environment where you are running the code.

The above code is a simple 4-bit full adder. 

```systemverilog
module Problem1(input logic
