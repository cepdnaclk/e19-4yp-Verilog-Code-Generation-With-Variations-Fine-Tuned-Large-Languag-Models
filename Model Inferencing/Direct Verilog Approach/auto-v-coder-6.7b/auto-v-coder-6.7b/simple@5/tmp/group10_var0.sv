### This change ensures the output cout of the ALU is a logic-vector, which is the expected type in Verilog. However, for logic-vector compatibility, the type should indeed be wire or logic as it is in the ALU module. The actual changes will depend on the ALU implementation.
Remember to use this modified verilog code in your testbench to test your ALU's logic-vector compatibility. If you're still having issues, it may be due to the specifics of the ALU's implementation. Good luck with your testing and verification process.###
