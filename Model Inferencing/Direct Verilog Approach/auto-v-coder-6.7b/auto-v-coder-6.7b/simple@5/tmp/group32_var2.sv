```verilog
module t_Clock_Prog ();
wire clock;

initial #100 $finish;

typedef enum {DEFAULT, NON_DEFAULT} t_enum;

Clock_Prog M1 (clk, resetn);

endmodule
```
### Explanation:
In the above code, a resetn signal was replaced with a enum variable t_enum. The enum was designed to have two states: DEFAULT and NON_DEFAULT. The Clock_Prog module needs to be replaced with the actual module definition to be tested. The main point here is to test what happens when an enum is used as a module input. ### Testing Steps:
The testbench must be developed to verify the functionality of the module when the enum value is changed. The testbench should include logic to stimulate the switch between DEFAULT and NON_DEFAULT enum types, and then verify the outputs of the module.
NOTE: The implementation of the module is not shown and therefore you should replace Clock_Prog with your actual module. The provided code is just a starting point and can be adapted according to the specific requirements of your design.```verilog
module t_Clock_Prog ();
wire clock;

initial #100 $finish;

task automatic test_prog(input t_enum resetn);
    // Stimulate the resetn
    // Read output
    // Test output
endtask

initial begin
    test_prog(DEFAULT);
    test_prog(NON_DEFAULT);
    $finish;
end

endmodule
```
This testbench will initialize the test with the default state, wait for the test to finish, then initialize the test with the non-default state, and finally end the testbench.

Please note that this is a simple example, you will need to work with your actual module and adjust the task appropriately to control and verify its functionality. In the provided code, the simulation will not start, as the actual module Clock_Prog is unknown. Replace it with your actual module's name to make it work.!
