```verilog
// Verilog code for Problem 4
module XOR_Gate(
    input logic [1:0] A [0:3],
    input logic [1:0] B [0:3],
    output logic [1:0] Y [0:3]
);
    integer i;
    always_comb begin
        for(i = 0; i < 4; i = i + 1) begin
            Y[i] = A[i] ^ B[i];
        end
    end
endmodule
```
In this modified code, A and B are 2-bit elements of a 1D array, indexed from 0 to 3. The output Y is likewise a 2-bit array, with each element representing the result of the XOR operation of the correspondent elements of A and B.

This code uses a for-loop to iterate over each element of the input arrays A and B, applying the XOR operation, and then assigning the result to the corresponding element of the output array Y. The 'always_comb' construct is used to specify this operation as a combinational circuit.

Please note that array sizes like A[0:3] and B[0:3] are just examples, you can change these to any positive integer that fits in your Verilog project.

Also keep in mind that Verilog does not support 1D packed arrays. This code would not compile in Verilog. It would be better to use Verilog's built-in 1D logic vector data types. This is just an example of how you can work with multi-dimensional arrays.

If you are using SystemVerilog, you can use packed arrays to make things easier:

```systemverilog
// SystemVerilog code for Problem 4
module XOR_Gate(
    input logic [1:0] A [3:0],
    input logic [1:0] B [3:0],
    output logic [1:0] Y [3:0]
);
    always_comb begin
        foreach(A[i]) begin
            Y[i] = A[i] ^ B[i];
        end
    end
endmodule
```
In SystemVerilog, arrays can be declared with
