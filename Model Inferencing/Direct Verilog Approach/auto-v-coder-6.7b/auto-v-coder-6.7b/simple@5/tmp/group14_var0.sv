This variation changes the testbench from using hexadecimal inputs to using binary inputs. It applies inputs to the ALU for a variety of functions (addition, subtraction, AND, OR), and also tests the carry in and carry out. The delay #10 between each test case is for simulating that the operation is completed. The monitor displays the current inputs and outputs at each cycle.

Please note that the actual testbench and ALU implementation will be different based on the specific functionality of your ALU. 

The new changes are just to give you an illustration on how you can test multi-bit logic behavior on different inputs. ###

In terms of test coverage, it's highly recommended to cover every possible input combination for a given function. This can be done using for loops or cases in Verilog to generate all possible combinations. This will ensure that your
