```systemverilog
module tst_dff_pbeh();
  logic di,clk; logic do;
  dff_p d1(do,di,clk); // Instantiate DFF with path delay
  initial begin clk=0; di=1'b0; #35 $stop; end // Initialize & stop
  always #3 clk=~clk; // Generate clock (negedges at 6, 12, 18...)
  always #5 di=~di; // Toggle data
  initial $monitor($time,"clk=%b, di=%b, do=%b",clk,di,do);
endmodule
```
This modification ensures compatibility with SystemVerilog types. The type logic is used instead of reg for variables that can be either 1'b0 or 1'b1 (boolean logic). The "always" block is used for creating a clock as well as toggling the inputs "di". SystemVerilog uses a "$monitor" statement to display the time, clk, di, and do values at each positive edge. The clock is generated at each positive edge and the inputs are toggled every 5 time units. Finally, the simulation stops after 35 time units. 

The SystemVerilog code is fully compatible with Verilog2001 and later versions, and is generally accepted for use in industry. However, if your specific synthesis tool does not support SystemVerilog, you may need to use Verilog for this task.
