```verilog
module AndOr (output X, Y, input bit A, B, C);
assign #10 X = A & B;
assign #10 Y = B | C;
endmodule
```
In the modified code, the type of the input A, B, C is changed from `wire` to `bit`, which is the bit type in the SystemVerilog. The bit datatype in SystemVerilog is similar to `logic` datatype in Verilog-2005. It can be used to declare variables that can take one of two possible values: 0 or 1. The bit datatype can be used to implement bit operations, as in the AND and OR operations in the example.

One of the main benefits of SystemVerilog, over Verilog-2005, is its ability to use bit datatype. This makes the code more readable and maintainable, especially when the signals are of a binary nature. For example, in a parallel shift register, bit datatypes can be used to control the shifting of bits. 

Another important advantage of SystemVerilog is its explicit control over delays, which is better suited to real-time systems. In the code above, the delay of 10ns is specified for each assignment statement. This is essential when the assignment of X and Y needs to occur at different times to be accurately related to the respective input signals. 

Note that the delay specification must be in the same order as the signal list. If X, Y were specified after A, B, C, the delays would not apply to the respective assignments.

Also in this example, the assignment statement `assign` is used to assign a value to a variable or signal. It's a more modern way to perform the tasks associated with the Verilog `assign` statement. It supports a delay specification in its operation. It provides a direct mechanism for delaying the value of a signal or assigning a value to a variable.

For more information on the bit datatype in SystemVerilog, refer to the IEEE Standard 1800-2017. It provides detailed information about the bit datatype. The bit datatype is a more powerful and flexible datatype in SystemVerilog, which can be used to handle binary values in real-time systems.
