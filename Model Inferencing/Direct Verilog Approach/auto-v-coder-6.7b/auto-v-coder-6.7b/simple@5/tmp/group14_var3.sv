```verilog
module tst_alu1();
  reg [3:0]a,b; reg[1:0] f; reg cci; wire[3:0]d; wire co;
  alu_1 aa(d,co,a,b,f,cci); // Instantiate ALU
  initial begin 
    cci=1'b0; 
    f=2'b00; 
    a=4'hF; 
    b=4'hA; 
    #30 $stop; 
  end // Initialize & stop
  always begin // Apply stimulus
  end
  initial $monitor($time, " cci = %b, a= %h,b = %h,f = %b,d =%h,co= %b ",cci,a,b,f,d,co); // Use %h
endmodule
```
### Explanation:
The inputs are set to `4'hF` and `4'hA` for `a` and `b` respectively, which are in hex. 

This can be changed to any value you want and will allow you to check the functionality of your combinational logic. However, please note that this might not cover all possible cases and combinations of inputs if the ALU is designed to handle them. You might want to use a different method of testing depending on what you're interested in verifying. ### Conclusion:
This verilog code has been modified to test the functionality of the ALU by setting the values of the inputs and observing the outputs of the ALU. This is a simple way to ensure that your combinational logic works as intended. It's a starting point for you to further test your design.

Remember that Verilog syntax can vary slightly across different versions and environments, so always refer to the respective documentation when in doubt. 

Before running this code, it's important to make sure your design compiles and synthesizes properly. This would ensure that there are no undeclared variables or errors in the Verilog code. 

You can use simulation tools like ModelSim or any other verilog simulator to run the test bench. 

Please make sure to replace the `alu_1` with your actual ALU
