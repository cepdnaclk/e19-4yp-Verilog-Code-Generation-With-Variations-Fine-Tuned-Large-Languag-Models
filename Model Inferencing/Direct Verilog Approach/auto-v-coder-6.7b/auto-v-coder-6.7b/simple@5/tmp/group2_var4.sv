```Verilog
module test;
wire a;

typedef struct packed {
    logic x, y, z;
} SignalPacked;

SignalPacked signals;

assign #25 a = 1;
always begin
    signals.x = #10 a;
end
endmodule
```
In this modified version, a packed structure named `SignalPacked` is defined to hold the signals x, y, and z. This structure is then used to assign and access these signals. The assignments and read operations are performed via the `SignalPacked` structure. This approach can be used to improve the readability and maintainability of the code by grouping similar signals together and simplifying the assignments and read operations to a single line. It also provides better control over the timing of these operations, making the code more robust and easier to manage. (#verilog)
