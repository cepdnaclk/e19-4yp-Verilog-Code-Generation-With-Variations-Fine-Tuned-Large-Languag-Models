```verilog
module AndOr (output X, Y, bit A, B, C);
assign #10 X = A & B;
assign #10 Y = B | C;
endmodule
```
In this variation, the input type is changed from `wire` to `bit`. This is a different syntax in SystemVerilog that represents a single bit value. In this variation, you would be able to test the usage of SystemVerilog's bit datatype.

Please note that SystemVerilog is a superset of Verilog which means you can use all Verilog constructs in SystemVerilog, including the bit datatype. So, this code will work with any Verilog synthesis tool, but it might not be valid for some other types of synthesis tools or for different Verilog versions. For better compatibility, always use the Verilog constructs as standard when possible.

Also, keep in mind that Verilog does not have a native bit data type, but it can be simulated using a bit datatype in a simulator. This is due to the fact that Verilog is often used for gate-level simulations, where bits are simulated using wires. However, the actual bit datatype used in synthesis is determined by what the synthesis tool you're using supports. In some cases, it might be a single bit that is simulated as a net or a group of bits. For more advanced simulations and synthesis, SystemVerilog's bit datatype can be a great tool to work with.

Finally, be aware that this change affects how the module is expected to be used in Verilog code because the input, for example, `A`, `B` and `C`, are expected to be a single bit data type. If you give these inputs a value outside the bit datatype, the simulation/synthesis process will either give an error or a warning, depending on the synthesis tool you are using. 

Please be aware that this is just a change in code, and you should make sure to test your code thoroughly and thoroughly understand the implications of this change. If you're using a Verilog synthesis tool, this code will not be synthesizable, but it will be functional and will run in a simulation. 

The above example should be used in conjunction with a Verilog simulation tool.
