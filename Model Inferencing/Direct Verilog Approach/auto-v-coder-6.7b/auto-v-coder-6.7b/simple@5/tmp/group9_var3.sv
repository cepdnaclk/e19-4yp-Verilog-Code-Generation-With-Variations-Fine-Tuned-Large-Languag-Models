```verilog
// Packed structure definition
typedef struct packed {
  logic x;
  logic y;
  logic z;
} my_packed_t;

// Module declaration with packed structure inputs and outputs
module Problem8(my_packed_t a, my_packed_t b, output my_packed_t diff);
  // Assign the difference of packed structure members
  assign diff.x = a.x - b.x;
  assign diff.y = a.y - b.y;
  assign diff.z = a.z - b.z;
endmodule
```
In this code, a packed structure `my_packed_t` is defined that includes logic signals `x`, `y`, and `z`. The module uses this packed structure for its inputs and outputs. The difference of each member of the structures is assigned to the corresponding member of the output structure.

Remember that Verilog does not support bitwise operations on packed structures, so the subtraction operation has to be implemented with individual logic signals. This modified code does not support operations on whole packed structures, but it does demonstrate how packed structures can be used in Verilog to model complex data structures.
