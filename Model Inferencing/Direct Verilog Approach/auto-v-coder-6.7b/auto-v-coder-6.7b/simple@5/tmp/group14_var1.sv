This code will initialize the `a` and `b` inputs with all possible combinations (from 0 to 15, as we are using 4-bit binary numbers), and verify the correctness of the output and carry-out flag. The `$display` statements are used to print debugging messages, and the `$monitor` statement is used to display the current values of the signals `cci`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `d`, and `co`.

This code will test the ALU with different combinations of inputs and verify that the correct output and carry-out flag are produced. The `$stop();` command is used to stop the simulation after all tests have been performed.

Please note that the delay of #10 is used to allow the ALU to perform its operations, and the inputs can be adjusted according to the specific implementation of the ALU.

The ALU implementation is assumed to be in the file named "alu_1.sv". If the file is located in a different directory, you may need
