```verilog
// Modified Base Verilog Code
module orfr_tst; // Testbench for OR gate with force/release
  reg b,c; wire a;
  initial begin b=1'b0; c=1'b0; #20 $stop; end // Initialize inputs
  always #3 c = ~c; // Toggle input 'c' every 3 time units
  or_fr_rl #(.DataIn({1'b0, "Test data 1"}),.DataOut({1'b0, "Test data 2"})) dd(a,b,c); // Instantiate the module containing force/release
endmodule
```
In the given code, we add `#(.DataIn({1'b0, "Test data 1"}),.DataOut({1'b0, "Test data 2"}))` to the module instantiation, where `DataIn` and `DataOut` are the fields of a structure. This structure is then passed as a parameter to the module `or_fr_rl`. 

Note: This is a simple example and can be extended to include more fields and types in the data structure as needed. The data structure type used here is a packed array of a constant size. In a more complex structure, the `struct` keyword can be used instead of packed arrays, and the fields can have more complex types.

This modification is a demonstration of how to use parameters in Verilog. It makes the code more versatile and adaptable by allowing the user to customize the structure's data in the instantiation. However, please keep in mind that this example is quite simplistic and doesn't truly demonstrate the power of parameters in Verilog. Understanding the basics of parameters in Verilog, and how to use them effectively, is an essential skill for effective verilog designing.

Also, the code should be compiled and synthesized using a suitable tool for Verilog to successfully execute the instantiated module. In this case, I used a simple OR gate because of the lack of actual modules in the code. In general, remember to use correct parameter types when using parameters in module instantiation. And also please ensure that the actual module used has a compatible type for the input and output parameters. In this example, I used a simple 2-bit logic and string
