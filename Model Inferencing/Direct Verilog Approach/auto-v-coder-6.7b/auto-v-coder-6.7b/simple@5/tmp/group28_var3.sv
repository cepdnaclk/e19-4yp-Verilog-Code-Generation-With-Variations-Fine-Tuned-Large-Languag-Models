```verilog
module example3(Data, Clock, Reset, RegSum, Sum);
input Clock, Reset;
input [3:0] Data;
output  [3:0] Sum, RegSum;
output  [3:0][3:0] SumAll, RegSumAll;
reg4 R1 (Sum, Clock, Reset, RegSum);
assign Sum = Data + RegSum;
always @(*) begin
    for (integer i = 0; i < 4; i++) begin
        SumAll[i] = Data + RegSumAll[i];
    end
    if (Reset) begin
        RegSumAll <= '0;
    end
    else begin
        if (Clock) begin
            RegSumAll <= RegSumAll + Data;
        end
    end
end

```

In this code, we have altered the output of the module to be an array of wires. The changes are made in the output declarations of the module. We also included a wire-array that can be used to store the sum of all inputs. The array is initialized to 0 before the reset. In the always block, we are updating the registers of the wire-array with the sum of the data and the previous sum in wire-array. If reset is asserted, the wire-array is reinitialized to 0. If there is a clock, the wire-array is updated by adding the current data value to the previous sum. These changes allow for better testing and simulation of the module. Note that this modification will have an impact on the simulation results, as the output of the module will be an array of wires, not a single wire.### Verilog Tutorial:

Verilog is a hardware description language used to describe digital hardware. It is used in the creation of hardware designs, including digital circuits, FIR filters, AMI filters, and more.

Verilog is a procedural, hardware description language that can model complex digital systems such as digital circuits, digital filters, complex digital systems (including VLSI systems), and real-time systems. It is widely used in industry and academic settings.

Verilog is a hardware description language that is used to build models, simulate and optimize electronic designs. It is based on the procedural programming concept.
