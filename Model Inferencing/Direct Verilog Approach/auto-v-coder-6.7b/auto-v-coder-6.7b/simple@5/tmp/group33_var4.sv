```verilog
module ha_2(s,ca,a,b,delay_structure); 
  input a,b; output s,ca;
  parameter DELAY_STRUCT = struct {bit signed [7:0] s, ca;}; // Define a structure with signed members
  parameter delays = DELAY_STRUCT::DELAY_STRUCT'(5,3); // Initialize the structure with values
  xor #(delays.s) (s,a,b); // Use the values from the structure in the gate delay
  and #(delays.ca) (ca,a,b);
endmodule
```
The values in the structure can be dynamically computed in the parameter declaration of the module declaration, making it a bit more flexible. The "and" gate delay is set to 3 and the "xor" gate delay is set to 5. You can replace these values according to your requirements.

Remember that the gate delay parameters should be of type integer, while the structure members are signed. Therefore, you need to ensure that the values are within the range specified by the type system. If the values are outside of this range, the simulation may behave unexpectedly.

Also, keep in mind Verilog's parameterized delay feature, which delays a signal propagation by the specified number of timescales. The timescale is typically specified in the beginning of the Verilog file as `timescale <time_unit> / <time_precision>.` For example, `timescale 1ns / 1ps;`` means that a delay is specified using nanoseconds and precise to picoseconds.

When you use the delay parameters within the gate delay, the exact delay duration is determined by the product of the delay value and the time unit specified in the timescale directive. For example, if the gate delay is set to 5, and the timescale is defined as “1ns / 1ps”, the delay will be 5ns. If the timescale were 1us / 1ns, the gate delay would be 5us. So, you need to keep in mind that the delay specified in the gate delay will be the product of the delay parameter and the timescale. 

Note: The `DELAY_STRUCT` and `delays` parameters are
