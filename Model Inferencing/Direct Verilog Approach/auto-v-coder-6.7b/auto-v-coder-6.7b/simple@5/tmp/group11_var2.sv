```verilog
module DataComponent (DataIn, DataOut, ControlSignals);
input [7:0] DataIn;
output [7:0] DataOut;
input ControlSignals;
`define WIDTH 2
struct {
    logic [7:0] rand data;
} randDataStruct;
endmodule
```
In this code, we can see a struct `randDataStruct` has been defined with a member `data` of kind `logic` with 8-bit width. The `rand` keyword is used to allow Verilog to randomize this member during simulation. This means that during runtime, this member will have a random value assigned to it each time the module is instantiated. The `randDataStruct` can be used as input to the module for testing the randomization of data.

Please note that Verilog randomization only works in SystemVerilog and not with base Verilog. You can use these kind of structures and randomization in SystemVerilog. However, if you are writing a Verilog code, it won't accept Verilog-2005 syntax and won't support randomization. For SystemVerilog, you will have to use the `$urandom` function to randomize the data. 

The `ControlSignals` input is not used in the example, but it should be used within the module to control the behavior of the DataOut based on the signals.

Also, this modified code has the limitation that the `randDataStruct` cannot be used as module input directly. One workaround is to use a struct array or a queue. However, this will add additional complexity to the code. Hence, it's not a common scenario to use `rand` within Verilog module. As a best practice, randomization is usually done inside testbenches or other testbases for verification of the randomized `randDataStruct`.```verilog
module DataComponent (DataIn, DataOut, ControlSignals);
input [7:0] DataIn;
output [7:0] DataOut;
input ControlSignals;

struct {
    logic [7:0] rand data;
} randDataStruct;

assign DataOut = (ControlSignals)? DataIn : randDataStruct.data;
