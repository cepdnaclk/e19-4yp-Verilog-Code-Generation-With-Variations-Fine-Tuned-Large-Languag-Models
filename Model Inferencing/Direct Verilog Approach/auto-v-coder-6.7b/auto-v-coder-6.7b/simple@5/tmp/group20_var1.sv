```verilog
module latch (input d, c, output reg q, q_b );

typedef union tagged {
    integer a;
    logic   b;
} Output;

Output out;

always begin
    wait ( c );
    #5;
    q = d;
    q_b = ~d;
    out.a = d;
end

endmodule
```
In this code, instead of using a single output `q`, we declare a union-based output `out` and set its value during the always block. This allows us to test the change by setting `out` to different types of values. 

Please note that these changes are purely for simulation and testing. The actual implementation of a D flip-flop in Verilog should always use `reg` for outputs, as it reflects the actual hardware behavior.### The code will only compile and execute if the proper simulation tool is used. The actual hardware implementation would be different. This is just to illustrate how one could simulate different output types.MTI-2018.06-SP4-1+EDT
