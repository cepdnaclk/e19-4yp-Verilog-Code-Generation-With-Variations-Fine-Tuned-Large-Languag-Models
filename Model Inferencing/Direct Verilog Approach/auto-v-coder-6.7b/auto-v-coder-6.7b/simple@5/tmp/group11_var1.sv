```verilog
// Define a new struct type
typedef struct {
    bit [7:0] DataIn;
    bit [7:0] DataOut;
    bit ControlSignals;
} data_t;

module DataComponent (data_t Data);
// No need for input/output declerations
endmodule
```
In this modified code, instead of declaring input signals, we define a struct `data_t` containing the input bits. This struct is then used as the input to the module. When the module is called, the tool will automatically generate random values for the input signals within the struct. This allows us to test randomization capabilities inside the struct.

To use this code, you would create an instance of the `DataComponent` module and then assign values to the members of the `data_t` struct. The values will be automatically assigned by the tool:

```verilog
data_t my_data;
initial begin
    my_data.DataIn = 8'b11110000;
    my_data.ControlSignals = 1'b1;
end

DataComponent data_inst(.Data(my_data));
```
In this example, `DataIn` is assigned a value of `8'b11110000`, and `ControlSignals` is assigned a value of `1'b1`. Note that these values would be replaced with random values by the tool when the simulation is run.

Remember to include the necessary header files for randomization if needed. E.g., `$random(seed)`, `#(1,0)`, `$urandom(seed)` etc. can be used to get a random value for the struct members.

Also note that since the struct members and the module ports are now interconnected, changing the value of `DataOut` in the struct will also affect the output of `DataOut` on the module's output ports. Similarly, changing the value of `ControlSignals` will affect the control signals of the module.

This is just one way to use randomization in Verilog, and the syntax can slightly vary based on the specific Verilog tool you are using.
