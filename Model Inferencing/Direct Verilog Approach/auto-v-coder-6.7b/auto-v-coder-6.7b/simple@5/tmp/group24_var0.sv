```verilog
module DFF_union(input packet_in, output packet_out); // packet_in is of type union {int[3:0] [4], int[3:0] [5] }
   reg[3:0] [4:0] packet_out;

   always @(posedge packet_in[4]) begin
      packet_out <= packet_in;
   end
endmodule
```
In this modified code, Union packet_in is used as a test of union handling in module ports. This code uses a packed union as input to the module. The input union includes two fields, each of which is an array of four elements. The output is a single array of five elements. The module uses a single-bit edge-triggered D flip-flop to copy the input data to the output when a positive edge occurs on the fourth element of the input array, which is the first field. This is a simple test of union handling in Verilog.

Note: Verilog does not support union type as a module port directly. You may need to cast the input to a compatible type in your top module. Please replace the input and output in the module with the appropriate size and type needed to fit your use case. In the above example, the `packet_in` is assumed to be an integer, and the `packet_out` is assumed to be a bit-vector. 

Also, the behavior described above assumes that the input array is a "valid" combination, i.e., `packet_in[4]` is asserted. This is a very basic test where input and output are only triggered by the 4th element of the input array. More advanced test scenarios would require more complex test cases and the use of specific Verilog constructs or tools that support union types.

Please note that Verilog is a procedural language, so there is no direct way to pass a union type as an argument directly to a module. This is one of the limitations of the Verilog language that must be taken into account when designing circuits in Verilog. Other languages like SystemVerilog can overcome this limitation.

In general, Verilog is not as flexible as some other languages in handling union types.
