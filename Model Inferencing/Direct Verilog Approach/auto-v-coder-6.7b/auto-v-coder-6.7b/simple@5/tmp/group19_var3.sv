In the modified code, we have added a static array of test cases. Each case is a bit pattern of the d-type flip-flop. The testbench now iterates through this array of test cases every clock cycle to test the d-type flip-flop. This verifies its correct operation with a dynamic array as input. Note that the array index is chosen randomly using an array length as modulus for the `$random % 5`. This ensures a randomized input sequence at each time step.

Please ensure you have the correct simulation setup in your environment where you can run sequential testing in Verilog. The code is not synthesizable as is, it only serves as a testing code. 

To test this code in a simulator, you will need to define a module named dff_inst and include the d-type flip-flop IP core from your available IP catalog in the design. Be sure to adjust the parameters as necessary to match the core. Also, remember to have a time delay and clock period defined in your test
