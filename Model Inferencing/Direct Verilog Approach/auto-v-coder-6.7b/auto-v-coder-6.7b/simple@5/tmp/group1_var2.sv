// Verilog code for Problem 5
module XOR_Gate(
    input logic [1:0] A [0:3],
    output logic Y
);
    always_comb begin
        Y = 1'b0;
        for (int i=0; i<4; i++) begin
            Y = Y ^ A[i][0];
            Y = Y ^ A[i][1];
        end
    end
endmodule

In this variation, A is a 1D logic-vector array of 2-bit elements, and the inside operator is used to test multi-dimensional array handling. The output Y is an XOR result of all elements of A. This modification does not change the behavior of the original problem statement as there is no change to the XOR logic as it's directly applied to 2-bit elements of A. The only difference is that A is declared as a packed 1D logic-vector array.### 

This code can be further extended to test different dimensions, different input size, or different logic handling. However, the purpose of this code is to show how one can handle multi-dimensional array input in Verilog for a hardware design.
