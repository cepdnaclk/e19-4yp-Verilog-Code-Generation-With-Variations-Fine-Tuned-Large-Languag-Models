We can store the delays in an unpacked structure. For this example, we'll use a structure with 2 signed integers.

```verilog
module ha_1(s,ca,a,b); // Half Adder with gate delays
  input a,b; output s,ca;
  
  // Define the structure with signed members for the gate delays
  typedef struct packed {
    int delay1;
    int delay2;
  } delay_t;
  
  // Initialize the delay structure
  delay_t delay_values;
  initial begin
    delay_values = '{1,2}; // Set the delays, in this case, for the xor and and gates respectively
  end

  xor #(delay_values.delay1) (s,a,b);
  and #(delay_values.delay2) (ca,a,b);
  
endmodule
```

This code sets the gate delays by initializing the `delay_values` structure and accessing its members in the xor and and gate delay directives. Note that the '{' and '}' brackets are used to initialize the structure, with the `delay_values` being a structure of type `delay_t`.

This approach allows the delays to be dynamically varied by altering the delay_values at various points in the code. Note that the gate delays should be set to non-negative values as they are added to the gates. If the delay_values' members are negative, an error or warning will be given by the Verilog compiler.

This variation will also be suitable for more complex Verilog designs which may require different delays for different gates or for different parts of the design. 

One additional benefit of using such an approach is that it provides a clear and structured way of controlling the timing of a design, which might be desirable in certain specific cases like power and timing constraints.

Please note that this is a simplistic approach and may not be the best solution for every design, especially if the delays don't depend on other variables. It's always a good idea to consider using a more sophisticated timing analysis tool or method at this stage. If delays are not needed in such a small scale design, this approach may not be suitable for your needs.
