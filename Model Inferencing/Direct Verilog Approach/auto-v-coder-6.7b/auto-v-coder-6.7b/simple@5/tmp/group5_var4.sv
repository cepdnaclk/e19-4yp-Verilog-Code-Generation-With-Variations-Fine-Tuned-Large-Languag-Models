```systemverilog
module tst_dff_pbeh();
  logic di,clk; wire do;
  dff_p d1(do,di,clk); // Instantiate DFF with path delay
  initial begin clk=0; di=1'b0; #35 $stop; end // Initialize & stop
  always #3 clk=~clk; // Generate clock (negedges at 6, 12, 18...)
  always #5 di=~di; // Toggle data
  initial $monitor($time,"clk=%b, di=%b, do=%b",clk,di,do);
endmodule
```
The modifications are as follows:
- Replace `reg` with `logic` for `di` and `clk`.
- Use `logic` for `di`, `clk` and `do` when you need to declare a variable to be of type logic.
- Use `wire` for `do` to declare a wire.
- Use `initial begin` and `$stop` for simulation control.
- Use `initial $monitor` to display the simulation waveform during simulation.
- Use `always` and `#` for generating clock.
- Use `always` again for toggling the data.
- Remove the semi-colon after `do` in the declaration of the DFF instance.

This code will perform the same function as the original one but with the added benefits of SystemVerilog compatibility. It uses `logic` for variables, `wire` for output, and `initial` for simulation control and `$monitor` for waveform display. The clock is generated using `always` and `#`, and the data is toggled using another `always`. Note that the original code is designed for Verilog and may not work as expected in SystemVerilog.

Also, note that SystemVerilog is a stricter language than Verilog, and it provides more functionality and syntax compatibility. Hence, the initial code may not be suitable for SystemVerilog simulation.
