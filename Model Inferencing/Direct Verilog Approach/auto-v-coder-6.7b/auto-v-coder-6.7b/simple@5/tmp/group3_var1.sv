```verilog
module full_adder(i1, i2, cin, sum, cout);
input i1, i2, cin;
output sum, logic cout;
assign sum = i1 ^ i2 ^ cin;
assign cout = (i1 & i2) | (cin & (i1 | i2));
endmodule
```

In the modified code, the output `cout` type has been changed to `logic` type to match the logic-vector compatibility. This code is equivalent to the original one as logic is a built-in data type in Verilog. However, it's not recommended to use `logic` as the output type of a module, as it might not be supported by some tools or may lead to unexpected behavior. It's generally recommended to use `wire` for inputs and outputs in Verilog. Please use this variation carefully.

Please note, the output type `logic` should be used when you want the compiler to infer a width of the output, typically used in SystemVerilog. For example, it can be used to infer a vector of logic by declaring `logic [1:0] out_vector;`. In Verilog-2001, the compiler only infers the width of the first instance of a vector output. If you are using Verilog-2001, you should use `wire` instead of `logic` for this reason. In SystemVerilog, if you have an array of 1-bit outputs, you should use `logic` instead of `bit`. In this case, the `logic` type allows for inferred width of the output vector, which was not possible with `bit` in SystemVerilog.

For the purpose of this code, `logic` may not be strictly necessary, but it's still a good habit to use `logic` whenever you want to infer a width for an output vector.

Remember to always test your code for any discrepancies before integrating it into your designs as logic-vector compatibility can affect the operation of your design.

The testbench for this module can be very simple, as it does not require any special conditions or assertions. It could be as follows:

```verilog
module full_adder_test;
  logic i1, i2, cin;
  wire sum,
