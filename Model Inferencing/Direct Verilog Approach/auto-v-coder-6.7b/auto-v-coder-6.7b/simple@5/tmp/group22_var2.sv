```verilog
module par(in, parity, all_ones);
input [7:0] in;
output parity, all_ones;

// Unpacks the input into a structure
struct packed {
  logic x1;
  logic x2;
  logic x3;
  logic x4;
} in_struct;

// Assigns individual inputs into the struct
assign in_struct = in;

// Assigns the parity bit from the struct inputs
assign parity = ^in_struct;

// Assigns the all ones bit from the struct inputs
assign all_ones = &in_struct;

endmodule
```
In the modified code, we first unpacked the input into a struct and then applied individual input operations to the struct. This allowed us to apply the bitwise operations to the struct-based logic fields. The parallel parity bit is determined from the bitwise xor operation, and the "all ones" bit is determined using the bitwise and operation. The struct-based approach provides a more verilog-friendly approach to accessing individual bit fields. When using structures, the bitwise operations `^` and `&` can be applied directly to the structure fields. The unpacked struct acts as a wrapper for the input bits, simplifying the process of applying bitwise operations to the individual bits. This approach helps to make the code more readable and maintainable.

Please note that the original Verilog code only considers the first 4 input bits (x1â€“x4) to calculate parity and 'all_ones'. In the modified code, all 8 input bits are unpacked into the struct and operated on that struct as a whole. If you only want to consider the first 4 bits, you can modify the struct unpacking in the modified code. This modification would also require modifying the assignment statements for the parity and all_ones output as they now consider the entire input. 

Also, note that this example demonstrates a way to approach the problem. The packed struct in Verilog can also be used for other more complex data types. The exact use case will depend on your specific needs and the complexity of the overall design. 

Remember the use of unpacked arrays or structures in Verilog can be crucial for structuring and managing complex data types, but the approach also requires careful
