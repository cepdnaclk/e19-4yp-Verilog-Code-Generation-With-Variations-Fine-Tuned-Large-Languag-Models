```verilog
module test;
wire a;
packed struct {
    reg x;
    reg y;
    reg z;
} signals;
assign #25 a = 1;
always begin
    signals.x = #10 a;
end
endmodule
```
In this code, we have defined a packed structure `signals` that includes the signals `x`, `y`, and `z`. Then, the assignments are modified to assign the signal `a` to the `x` field of the `signals` structure.

Please note, packed structures in Verilog can behave rather differently depending on the synthesis tool being used. While it is a feature of the Verilog language, different synthesis tools have different behaviors.

Additionally, `packed struct` doesn't support unpacked arrays, so using packed structs with reg types cannot be used with unpacked arrays or structures.

Lastly, also be aware that Verilog doesn't directly support variable delays (like Verilog assign statement or always block), so using `#` keyword in the assignments might not behave as you expect, especially when using packed structures as signals. 

Please also remember to validate your code using a specific synthesis tool to ensure the functionality. Note that not all hardware synthesis tools support packed structs. 

If your code is synthesizable, you should also consider using a proper reset or another method of synchronization to ensure that your assignments are applied only when you want them to. Without proper synchronization, you might get undefined values due to asynchronous signal assignments. 

Also, you can't directly use reg type signals in UVM (Universal Verification Methodology). If you use UVM, you need to use `logic` type signals or convert them into `reg` type in the testbench. This is because `logic` type is typically the type used for DUT signals in UVM. 

Please keep these points in mind while using packed structs in Verilog. ### End Variation Instruction.```verilog
