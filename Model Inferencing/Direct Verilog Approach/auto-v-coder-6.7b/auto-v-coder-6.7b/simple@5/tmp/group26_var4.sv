```verilog
module gade(a,a1,b,c,b1,c1);
// Declare inputs and output structure
input b,c,b1,c1;
output struct packed {
    logic a;
    logic a1;
} a_a1;

// Instantiate OR gate with inertial delay 3
or #3 gg1(a_a1.a1,c1,b1);
// Instantiate AND gate with rise=2, fall=1 inertial delay
and #(2,1) gg2(a_a1.a,c,b);
endmodule
```
In this variation, `struct packed` keyword is used to pack the output structure. The struct type is a scalar type, so when packed, it reduces the signal width. This can be useful in reducing area usage of combinational logic or to reduce the fan out. When using a packed structure, we need to use the logic keyword to declare the structure member instead of `wire` `reg`.

This variation code does not change the function of the design, but it changes the syntax to match the packed structure in output.

With this modification, you can directly use the `a` and `a1` outputs from the module. If you want to use a specific output, you can access it by using the dot operator, like `a_a1.a1` or `a_a1.a`.

Please note that the packed structure is synthesizable on most of the FPGAs, but when using it with Verilog-2001 standard, it might result in errors or unexpected behavior. It's recommended to use packed structures only if you're sure of the consequences. If it's not the desired behavior, consider to use unpacked structures.

Also, remember to test this code to ensure the modified function and behavior are as expected. 

Please note that this is a basic example and may not cover all possible use cases or edge cases. The actual implementation may need additional considerations, depending on the specific requirements of the design.

Please note that it's always a good practice to read the relevant documentation for the specific FPGA architecture you're targeting when designing your Verilog code. The Verilog standard itself is not the most reliable guide,
