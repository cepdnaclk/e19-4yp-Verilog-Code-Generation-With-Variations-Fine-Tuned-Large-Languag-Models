```
module DataComponent (DataIn, DataOut, ControlSignals);
struct packed {
  rand bit[7:0] DataIn;
} DataIn;
output [7:0] DataOut;
input ControlSignals;
endmodule
```
In this code, the module is modified to contain a structure called `DataIn`. This structure contains a member `DataIn`, which is a rand bit. When a module instance of DataComponent is instantiated, the randomization can be initiated on the member `DataIn` of the struct. The `DataOut` output and `ControlSignals` input are still there but they are not modified. 

Please note that the usage of this module/module instance has to consider the randomization inside the struct `DataIn`, which needs to be done at the beginning of the simulation.### Also, make sure to add the declaration for DataIn in the module instance to properly initialize it during simulation.

For example,
```
module DataComponent_tb;
  DataComponent uut(); // Instantiate the module
  initial begin
    uut.DataIn.DataIn = 8'b1010_1010; // Initialize the random member.
    $monitor("DataIn = %b, DataOut = %b, ControlSignals = %b", uut.DataIn.DataIn, uut.DataOut, uut.ControlSignals);
  end
endmodule
```
This testbench code will monitor the DataIn, DataOut and ControlSignals at each simulation step. Without initializing the struct member, the module will initialize it using default values.### If you want to verify that the struct `DataIn` is randomized, you should run the simulation and print the contents of `DataIn` at the end, before the simulation is finished.### The following code can be used to randomly initialize the data struct and print its contents:

```
initial begin
  uut.DataIn.randomize(); // Randomize the struct
  $display("Randomized DataIn: %b", uut.DataIn.DataIn); // Print its contents
end
```
Add this code inside your testbench file to see the initialized random values.```sv
