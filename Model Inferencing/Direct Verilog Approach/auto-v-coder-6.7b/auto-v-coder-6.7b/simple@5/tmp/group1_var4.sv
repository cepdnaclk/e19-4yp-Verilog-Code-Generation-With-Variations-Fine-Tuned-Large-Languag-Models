```verilog
// Verilog code for Problem 4
module XOR_Gate(
    input logic [1:0] A [0:3],
    input logic [1:0] B [0:3],
    output logic [1:0] Y [0:3]
);
    always_comb begin
        foreach(A[i, j, k, l]) begin
            Y[i, j, k, l] = A[i, j, k, l] ^ B[i, j, k, l];
        end
    end
endmodule
```
The code now includes multi-dimensional inputs and outputs. The `foreach` loop, combined with the `logic [1:0]` syntax, allows the code to handle multiple dimensions for A and B, resulting in the same number of multi-dimensional outputs. This code uses the xor operator (`^`) to find the complement of the bitwise AND operation between the corresponding index values from the two input arrays. 

Each dimension of the arrays is indexed as `i`, `j`, `k`, and `l`. Each of these arrays is 4-dimensional, with each dimension having 4 values. The `assign` statement inside the always_comb block is not needed here, since the code uses a `foreach` loop, which iterates over all the elements of the arrays. This is a common Verilog programming structure for handling arrays and multi-dimensional structures.

The output array Y is also 4-dimensional. In addition to the indexing, this code uses a bit-wise XOR operator to check for the complementary values between two inputs. The XOR operator performs element-wise comparison and returns the result in the form of a bit stream.

This code demonstrates flexibility and versatility, handling multi-dimensional arrays with various dimensions. It also uses the `always_comb` keyword to ensure that the output (Y) always reflects the changes in the inputs (A and B). However, please remember that Verilog does not support dynamic dimensions, so if you're trying to use a dynamic array size, you'd need to consider using a different language or toolset.```verilog
