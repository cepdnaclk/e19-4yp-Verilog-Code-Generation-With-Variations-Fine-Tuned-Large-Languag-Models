```Verilog
// An arbitrary packing of delays
typedef struct packed {
  bit [1:0] xor_delay;
  bit [1:0] and_delay;
} delay_struct;

parameter delay_struct delay = '{2'b11, 2'b10}; // Unpacked structure with default delay values

module ha_1(s,ca,a,b); // Half Adder with gate delays
  input a,b; output s,ca;
  xor #(delay.xor_delay) (s,a,b);
  and #(delay.and_delay) (ca,a,b);
endmodule
```
In this modified code, we have created a structure named `delay_struct` with two unsigned bits, one for the `xor` gate delay and the other for the `and` gate delay. Then, we define a parameter of type `delay_struct` named `delay`, and assign it the default values.

In this example, the `xor` gate delay is 3 and the `and` gate delay is 2. To change these values, simply modify the `delay` parameter.

Note: Verilog does not support negative delays. So, don't assign negative delays to your delays since they would result in an error.

Remember the default delay values should be within the defined range of the corresponding primitive gate.

For more information about the parameterized delays, refer to the appropriate Verilog IEEE Std 1364-2001 Standard.

Note: The gate delays are not synthesizable in the real hardware context. They are just for modeling and simulation.

Also, keep in mind that the value of delays are not synthesizable; they're just for timing analysis to help you understand the design's behavior and verify that it meets timing requirements. Real hardware wouldn't have to use these gate delays at all. If you're using these delays for timing closure, it's probably a mistake.###

Also, take into account that this is a parameter, so, when you instantiate the module, you will need to specify the delay values you want. The delays will only be applied to the gate delays in the module declaration, not to the output or input connections.### Variation Instruction:
