```verilog
// SystemVerilog code
module AndOr (output logic X, Y, input bit A, B, C);
assign #10 X = A & B;
assign #10 Y = B | C;
endmodule
```
### Explanations:
- The `bit` type in SystemVerilog is a single bit of data that can be used to represent a state (0 or 1), and can also be used as a data bus.
- The `logic` data type is also used to represent a signal in a circuit design. It includes all the functionality of the `wire` data type in the IEEE Std 1364-2001 standard.
- It can be used to declare a logic or an integer wire or register in a design.
- The `assign` keyword in SystemVerilog is used to assign a value to a variable or signal.
- In this code, `bit A, B, C` declares A, B and C as bit type variables.
- `#10` indicates a delay of 10 time units.
- The `X` is assigned the AND operator of `A` and `B`, and the `Y` is assigned the OR operator of `B` and `C`.
- `output logic X, Y, input bit A, B, C` declares the direction of the variables, `output` for the module output variables and `input` for the module input variables. 
- `logic` is a datatype keyword in SystemVerilog which behaves similar to the wire datatype.
- 'logic' and 'wire' datatype are used to define signal types whereas'reg' is used to define register types.
- It is important to note that `bit` and `logic` are synonymous in SystemVerilog. So, it is common to use either `bit` or `logic` to signify both a single bit value or a wire in a design.
- This variation can give a better understanding of how SystemVerilog treats the bit datatype in comparison to Verilog. 
- This can also be applied to the entire design, not just this simple module. Hence, the test should cover all the places in the design where the `bit` type is used.joy of codingjoy of codingjoy of coding
