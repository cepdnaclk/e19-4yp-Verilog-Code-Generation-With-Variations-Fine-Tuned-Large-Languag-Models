```verilog
module netdelay1(x,y);
input x;
output [0:31] y;
wire #(2,1) nn; // Declare wire 'nn' with rise=2, fall=1 delay
not (nn,x); // Assign NOT(x) to 'nn' (takes effect after rise/fall delay)
assign y={32{nn}}; // Assign 'nn' to 'y' (direct assignment)
endmodule
```
This modified code will create a 32-bit wide output 'y' with each of the 32 bits set to the output of the NOT gate.

This modification demonstrates the use of Verilog's structural modeling capabilities, by creating a unit width packed structure with 32 fields and assigning the output of the NOT gate to each field. This approach allows for greater control and understanding of the Verilog code, while maintaining the same functionality of the original code.

By making 'y' a packed array of 32 1-bit wide elements and assigning the same net delay to each one, the output can now be accessed and manipulated in a granular manner. This modifies the original code to better demonstrate the use of structural modeling in Verilog.
