```verilog
module DFF;
typedef union packed {
    logic [1:0] a;
    logic [1:0] b;
} u_t;

module Anding(u_t.a a, u_t.a b, u_t.b y);
assign y = a & b;
endmodule
```
This code will still not work because the input/output of the DFF module are not of expected types for a DFF instantiation in Verilog. They are packed unions. However, since packed unions are not directly supported as module input and output types in Verilog, we could still use them in this way if the application requires it for some reason. In this case, the DFF module's input and output are now both packed unions with the same types under the same tag.

When using "and", the resulting output is a packed union as well, matching with the input and output types of the module.

Please note that this will only create a packed union inside the module. If you need to access the individual bits of union variables you will have to use the. operator each time. Also, the input a and b of the Anding module are of type a and b respectively. This makes the code more clear, but there's no real benefits in using such a complex structure.

You should consider using structs for more complex data types in Verilog where you would need to access the individual fields of a complex data type. Packed unions are typically used for small amounts of data that fits in the same width. However, using packed unions to handle large amounts of data or more complex data structures is not typically necessary or recommended as it can make designs difficult to maintain and read.```verilog
module Anding (input u_t.a a, b, output u_t.b y);
assign y = a & b;
endmodule

typedef struct packed {
    logic [1:0] a;
    logic [1:0] b;
} u_t;

u_t instance;

// Example usage
initial begin
  instance.a = 2'b10;
  instance.b = 2'b01;
  #1 $display("%b %b", instance.a, instance.b);
  $display("%b",
