module ALU (output[31:0] Result, input logic [3:0] ArgA, ArgB, input Clk);
    logic[31:0] Result;
    always @(posedge Clk) begin
        case(1'b1) // Select any operation here
            1'b1: Result <= ArgA + ArgB; // Addition
            //default: Result <=?; // Add more operations here
        endcase
    end
endmodule
### Note:
The code above is a simple ALU with the add operation. You can extend it to handle more operations and add more complexity depending on your use case. The operation logic is written inside the always block, which is triggered on positive edge of the Clk signal. The selected operation is based on a case statement, and the "Result" output is assigned the result of the operation. Please replace the question mark "?" with the desired operation. Note that the "ArgA" and "ArgB" inputs are assumed to be signed logic vectors with four bits each. Replace "ArgA" and "ArgB" with the actual signals you're using. These modifications will allow for signed arithmetic operations and will allow for direct testing of the ALU. The original code only allowed unsigned arithmetic.

Also, make sure your test bench generates your clock signal. The clock signal is necessary for the always block to execute. You can generate it using:

```verilog
initial begin
  Clk = 0;
  forever begin
    #5 Clk <= ~Clk;
    #5 Clk <= ~Clk;
  end
end
```

Replace the clock frequency (5 and 5) with your actual clock frequency. This will generate a 100Mhz clock signal. If you want a slower clock, or a faster clock, you can adjust accordingly. 

It's not recommended to test ALUs directly. ALUs are more for logic design, and should be tested on a lower level (like combinational logic circuits) or using specialized testing methodology. This is just for illustration and testing purposes.### 

Also, remember that logic gates have delay, and for this reason, it's possible to create a circuit that is almost equivalent to a combinational logic circuit, but has a delay, this causes problems if you need to do timing analysis or formal
