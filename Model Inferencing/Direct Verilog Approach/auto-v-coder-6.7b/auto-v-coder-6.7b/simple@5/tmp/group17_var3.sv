```verilog
module ALU (output logic [3:0] Result, input logic [3:0] ArgA, ArgB, input Clk);

specify
    specparam tRise = 5, tFall = 4;
    (Clk *> Result) = (tRise, tFall);
end specify
  
assign Result = $signed(ArgA) + $signed(ArgB);  // Modified to perform signed addition

endmodule
```
In the modified version, the inputs ArgA and ArgB are of the signed logic [3:0] type. The signed addition of these two inputs is then assigned to the output Result. The '$signed' function is used to sign extend the values before performing addition. This allows the module to perform signed arithmetic operations correctly. The same timing parameters are defined as before.### Note:
The specifying of timing parameters is done at the port level, not the module level. The'specify' construct is used for defining specifications at the module level as well, but it is not used here for simplicity. This is a simplification of the original code snippet and does not cover all possible variations on verilog. 

It is crucial to understand that the use of specify constructs in Verilog is a practice that can be used to simplify the modeling of logic at a higher level than Verilog itself allows, but it is not a part of the Verilog standard. This means that the Verilog code you write could not be expected to be synthesizable by all tools and can be used only within certain constraints or for specific use-cases.

In the Verilog code above, the `specparam` is used for a 5ns rise and fall time. This is a common choice for Verilog as it often allows for reasonable synthesis to the desired timing. The `assign` statement is used to perform the signed addition operation.

The `$signed` function is used to sign extend the values before performing addition. This allows the module to perform signed arithmetic operations correctly. If you want to perform unsigned arithmetic operations, you can use `$unsigned` function instead.

The same timing parameters are defined as before, which can be used to define the timing constraint for the combinational logic inside the ALU module. However, note that these timing constraints should be defined at
