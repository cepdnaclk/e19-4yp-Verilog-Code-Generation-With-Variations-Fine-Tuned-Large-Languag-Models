```python
module latch (input d, c, output reg q, output reg q_b );
union {
logic[7:0] reg_out;
logic[3:0] slice_out;
} uout;

always begin
wait ( c );
uout.reg_out = {3'b011, d};
uout.slice_out = uout.reg_out[3:0];
q = uout.slice_out[0];
q_b = ~uout.slice_out[0];
end
endmodule
```
In this modified code, we have defined a `union` to get access to the whole 8-bit output and then sliced 4-bit output. The `slice_out` is connected to the outputs of the latch.
Note that the actual number of outputs are defined by the size of the slices and the number of elements in the array. In this case, `uout.slice_out` will provide 4 bits `{q[0],q[1],q[2],q[3]}`. 

This example demonstrates how to use union-based outputs in a Verilog design to access specific bits from the output of a multiplexer or other combinational logic elements. This can aid in debugging and testing, as it allows more nuanced and targeted visualization and understanding of the behavior of the design. 

This also shows how to handle packed arrays and slices in a Verilog design, which involves controlling the order, width or size of data to create custom outputs. 

Remember to replace `{3'b011, d}` with the actual logic you want to test for the output. 

Also, be aware that in some simulators, like ModelSim, it may not support packed array and union outputs very well, as they are not properly supported by all simulators. If your simulator does not support this feature, you may need to use a different approach to visualize the output.```python
module latch (input d, c, output reg q, output reg q_b );
wire [7:0] uout;

always begin
wait ( c );
uout = {3'b011, d};
q = uout[0];
