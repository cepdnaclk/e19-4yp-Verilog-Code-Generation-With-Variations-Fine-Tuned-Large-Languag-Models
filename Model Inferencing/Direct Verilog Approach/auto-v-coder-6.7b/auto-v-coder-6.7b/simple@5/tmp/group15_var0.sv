In this modified code, a testbench is added to validate the behavior of the design under various conditions. The input to the design is varied to include unsigned and signed numbers. The output is compared against the expected output to ascertain correct operation. This is done using SystemVerilog assertions. In this case, assertions are used to evaluate the equality of the output with the expected output. If the assertions fail, an `$error` will be displayed with the
