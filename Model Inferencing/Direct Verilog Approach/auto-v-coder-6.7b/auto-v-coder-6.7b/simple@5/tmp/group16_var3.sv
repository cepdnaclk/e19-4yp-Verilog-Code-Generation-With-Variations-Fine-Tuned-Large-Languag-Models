```systemverilog
module orfr_tst; // Testbench for OR gate with force/release
  reg b,c; wire a;
  initial begin b=1'b0; c=1'b0; #20 $stop; end // Initialize inputs
  always #3 c = ~c; // Toggle input 'c' every 3 time units

  typedef struct packed {
    logic logic_field;
    string string_field;
  } data_in;

  typedef struct packed {
    logic logic_field;
    string string_field;
  } data_out;

  data_in data_in1;
  data_out data_out1;

  or_fr_rl dd(data_out1.logic_field, data_in1.logic_field, data_in1.string_field); // Instantiate the module containing force/release
endmodule
```
This variation changes the input and output types from just logic to a struct of logic and string. This makes the testbench more complex as we need to test both logic and string fields. The logic_field is still a single logic bit, but the string_field is now a string variable. The testbench will need to update the force and release commands to match this structure.

Remember, this is just an example and the actual code might need to be different based on the specifics of your design or project. Also, the force and release commands are not used in the testbench but in a real design scenario where the testbench controls the input signals to drive the design under test. This is handled by the testbench designer and doesn't have to do with the testbench's code but is handled by a tool like ModelSim or Icarus Verilog, which provides these features. In this example, the structure is used purely to showcase using different types.```systemverilog
module or_fr_rl (output logic a, input logic b, string c);
  always @(posedge b) begin
    if(c == "hello")
      a = ~b;
    else if(c == "world")
      a = b;
    else
      a = b;
  end
endmodule
```
