// Verilog code for Problem 5
module Half_Adder(
    input A, B,
    output logic [7:0] Sum, Carry
);
    assign Sum = A ^ B;
    assign Carry = A & B;
endmodule

Please note that Verilog does not have Boolean data types. Instead, it uses bit-level signals, which can be either 0 or 1. As such, the output data types of the Half_Adder module were changed to logic [7:0] to align with these requirements. In this case, the outputs will be 8-bit logic vectors: Sum and Carry, which are both eight-bit wide. This change will ensure compatibility with the modern Verilog syntax. 

Also, it's important to note that Verilog requires explicit declaration of output ports for the module. In this case, the inputs to the module are A and B, and the output ports are Sum and Carry. The output ports are then assigned values using the 'assign' statement.

Finally, it's also worth noting that this is just a simple half-adder. However, we can extend this basic module by creating a full-adder or by creating a module that takes multiple inputs and/or multiple outputs to form a larger system. This allows for more complex circuits to be realized in Verilog.
