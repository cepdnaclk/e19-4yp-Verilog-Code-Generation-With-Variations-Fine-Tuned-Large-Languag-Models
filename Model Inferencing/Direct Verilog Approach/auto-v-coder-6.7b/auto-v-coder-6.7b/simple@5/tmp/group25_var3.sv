```verilog
module mos_strength (a, c, zn, zp);
input a, c;
output zn, zp;
nmos (zn, a, c); // NMOS passes 'a' when 'c' is 1 (outputs St0 or Z)
pmos (zp, a, c); // PMOS passes 'a' when 'c' is 0 (outputs St1 or Z)
endmodule
```
Note: The above code would not modify the actual behavior of the Verilog module, as it is a single-input single-output design for a NMOS and PMOS transistors which are intended to drive the gate of a logic gate. However, you can refer to the following example which uses a logic-vector based enum to test enum operations:

```verilog
module v_enum (a, b, s);
parameter [1:0] one = 2'b00, two = 2'b01, three = 2'b10, four = 2'b11;
parameter [3:0] s = 4'b0000; // s is output, a and b are inputs

input [1:0] a, b;
output [3:0] s;

always @* begin
  if(a==one && b==two) begin
    s = four;
  end else begin
    s = s;
  end
end

endmodule
```
In this case, `a` and `b` are inputs, and `s` is the output. If the values of `a` and `b` are one and two, respectively, the output `s` would be set to four. However, if the values are not one and two, then `s` would remain at the default value (which is four in this case).
It's important to note that this is a very basic example and doesn't take advantage of the strengths or faults of the enum type in Verilog. It's also important to remember that enum types in Verilog are just syntactic sugar and are not intrinsically different from bit vectors. They're just another way of labeling and referring to a specific sequence of values, not a new type of data. The primary advantage of using enums is their
