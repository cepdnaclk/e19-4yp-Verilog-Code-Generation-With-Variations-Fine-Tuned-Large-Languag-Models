```
module full_adder(i1, i2, cin, sum, cout);
input i1, i2, cin;
output logic sum, cout;
assign sum = i1 ^ i2 ^ cin;
assign cout = (i1 & i2) | (cin & (i1 | i2));
endmodule
```
This code will correctly calculate the sum and the carry out for full adder. It will work with logic-vector compatibility and handle the output signals as logic-vectors. The testbench code will remain the same and does not require any modification.### Summary:
The code was modified to include logic keyword in assign statements to work with logic-vector instead of wire. It provides a better compatibility with logic-vector testbenches. The output signals are declared as logic-vectors and handle the outputs as logic-vector signal. This will work even though it is slightly more specific, which might be required depending on the specifics of the testbench design.!
