This code introduces a struct with a rand bit [3:0] rand_data member, then tests the randomization of data in a loop with assertions. Please note that randomization is done using rand_next() function, which initializes the rand member to a random value within the specified range.### Explanation:
The randomization of rand_data to be between 0 and 15 is tested in a loop of 10 iterations. If the assertion fails, an error message will be printed to the stdout. The sequence of randomized values would be different each time the design is simulated. This verifies that the randomization works correctly.
