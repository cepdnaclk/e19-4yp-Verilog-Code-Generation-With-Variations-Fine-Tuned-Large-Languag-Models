```verilog
module netdelay1(x,y);
input x;
output [31:0] y;
wire #(2,1) nn; // Declare wire 'nn' with rise=2, fall=1 delay
not (nn,x); // Assign NOT(x) to 'nn' (takes effect after rise/fall delay)
assign y[31:0]=nn; // Assign 'nn' to 'y' (direct assignment)
endmodule
```
This modification of the code creates an array of 32 elements in the output 'y'. Each element is assigned a 'nn' delay from the input 'x'. This means that the output 'y' will represent the 32 outputs of the 'nn' delay from the input 'x'. The 'y' is designed to cover a wide range of structural granularity testing.

For the original task (simple NOT gate operation), the output is 32-bit wide and each bit is assigned a delay of 2-1 ns. This is for the purpose of verifying the timing analysis, circuit behavior and operation in varying conditions, like delay models etc. This is for verification of the timing attributes of the code. In an actual embedded system, this structure may not be used and the output could be a single bit. 

Remember to replace 'x' with your actual inputs. Keep it in mind that verilog has its own timing model and simulation, so these delays might not be perfectly accurate or consistent across all synthesis tools. It's a good practice to use a delay model to get a stable result.

Also note that in Verilog, if you want a specific delay between a rise (rising edge) and fall (falling edge) of a signal, you can use the `#` operator as `wire #(rise_delay, fall_delay)`. 

This modified code can be used, for example, to generate the equivalent of a 32-bit line of NOT gates from a single input. This can be used to test the timing behavior of such circuits in various scenarios. However, please remember that verilog timing analysis is not absolute and could vary across different synthesis tools and simulation environments. Also, keep in mind that the synthesis/simulation results might not be directly applicable to an actual embedded system design as Verilog is a hardware description language
