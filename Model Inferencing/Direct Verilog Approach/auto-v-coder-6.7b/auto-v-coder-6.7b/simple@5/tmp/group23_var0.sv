```
module FourFlopsStructL #(parameter DClk = 2, DBuf = 1, parameter WIDTH = 4)
(output byte Q, input byte D, input Ena, Clk);
wire[WIDTH-1:0] QWire;
localparam DTot = DBuf + DClk;
DFF #(WIDTH) DReg[WIDTH-1:0] (.Q(QWire),.D(D),.Clk(Clk));
assign #DTot Q = (Ena==1'b1)? QWire : 'bz;
endmodule
```
This code changes the input type to byte and adjusts the DFF instantiation accordingly. The output Q is also of byte type, consistent with the input D type. This code also updates the WIDTH parameter to allow for any WIDTH (number of bits). 

This code demonstrates how to make the module compatible with both byte and logic types of vectors. In real-world applications, especially in more complex systems, it is crucial to make modules that can handle different data types for maximum flexibility and compatibility. Note that this is an example and may not cover all edge cases, but it should give you a good starting point.

Remember to use a testbench to verify the moduleâ€™s correctness. Use a suitable simulator for your project such as Xilinx Vivado, ModelSim or GHDL for verification.

This code only demonstrates the structure and the functionality of the module. Make sure to replace the DFF with the actual primitive gate you're using in your hardware design. The input and output ports are also assumed to be of logic type. Adjust them according to your actual hardware design.###

Also, note that this is a basic example. In reality, you would want to make sure you have a good understanding of the timing, and other constraints that the module might have in a real-world design. These cannot be covered by a simple change in the Verilog code. The above code gives a general idea about input and output types and the instantiation of the module. It is important to make sure the actual module works considering all its constraints and behavior.
