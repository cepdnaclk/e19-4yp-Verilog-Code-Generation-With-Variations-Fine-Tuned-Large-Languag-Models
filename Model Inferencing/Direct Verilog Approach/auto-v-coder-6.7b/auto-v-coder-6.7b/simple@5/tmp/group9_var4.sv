```Verilog
module Problem8(input [3:0] a, b, output [3:0] diff);
  typedef struct packed {
    logic x;
    logic y;
    logic z;
  } Signals;

  Signals sig1;

  always_comb begin
    sig1.x = a[0];
    sig1.y = a[1];
    sig1.z = a[2];
    diff[0] = sig1.x;
    diff[1] = sig1.y;
    diff[2] = sig1.z;
  end
endmodule
```
The code above creates a packed structure Signals that holds the signals x, y, and z. It then assigns the values of a[0], a[1], and a[2] to sig1.x, sig1.y, and sig1.z, respectively. Finally, it assigns these signals to the outputs diff[0], diff[1], and diff[2]. This code demonstrates the use of packed structures and how the packed structure can be directly used in assignments.

Note that packing a struct in Verilog has certain restrictions. It must be used with always_comb or always_ff, and the size of that packed struct cannot be determined at elaboration time. Also, packed structs cannot be used with dynamic arrays, for example, in a for loop.

Keep in mind that packed structs may not be fully supported by all synthesis tools. As always, always test your design thoroughly in all possible tool environments and with all possible inputs at every transition (clock edge).

This variation of the problem demonstrates the potential for packed structs in Verilog and the benefits they can bring to a design, however, it's important to consider the above limitations before using packed structs in a final product.

For further information on Verilog packed structs, refer to the IEEE 1800-2017 standard or consult the synthesis tool's documentation.

This modification also demonstrates using packed structs with Verilog. The packed structs are designed to hold values efficiently due to their bit-encoded representation. However, if the intended use case is much more complex than a simple signal assignment, then a module would need to be constructed that operates on the packed structs, possibly
