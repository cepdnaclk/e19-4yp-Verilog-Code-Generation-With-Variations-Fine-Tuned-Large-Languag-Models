```verilog
wire in;
reg out;

always @(posedge in) begin
    out = 1;
end

always @(negedge in) begin
    out = 0;
end
```

In this code, we're creating a module that behaves like a wire. The `in` input is monitored continuously for changes on the positive edge. When it changes, `out` is set to 1. The `in` input is also monitored continuously for changes on the negative edge, and if it changes, `out` is set to 0.

This is a basic example of how a 'wire' acts like a continuous-time switch, continuously driven by the input logic `in`.

Please note that you should replace 'in' with the appropriate signal name in your design.

This code will not synthesize correctly due to the nature of Verilog, but it gives a clear view of the concept. In hardware, you'll never directly connect a wire to another wire, but this code exemplifies the behavior of a wire that is driven by an input. 

For actual hardware implementation, you should directly instantiate the module in your design and connect the inputs and outputs to the appropriate signals in the circuit.

Remember that in FPGA implementation, you need a clock and a reset signal to drive the module. This is for the always block which is used for continuous assignment. 

Also, if one wants to mimic the behavior of Verilog's native wire, one might consider using a flip-flop with an enable signal. In this case, your always block would look like:

```verilog
reg out;

always @(posedge clock or negedge reset) begin
    if (!reset) begin
        out <= 1'b0;    // Reset to 0, you can also set it to 1 based on your requirement
    end
    else begin
        out <= in;      // Drive the output with the input
    end
end
```

Replace clock and reset with your clock and reset signal names. This is a more traditional method of mimicking a wire. Both of these are valid and can be used depending on the requirements.

Note: Verilog's native wire is more of a conceptual entity, and the behavior for driving a wire
