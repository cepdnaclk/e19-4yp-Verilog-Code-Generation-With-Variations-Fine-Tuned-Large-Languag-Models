```Verilog
module clock_prog(
	input clock,
	input base_enum, // Non-default base type
	output reg output_signal
	);

enum {ZERO=0, ONE=1} base_enum;

always @ (*) begin
	case (base_enum)
		ZERO: output_signal <= 1'b0;
		ONE: output_signal <= 1'b1;
		default: output_signal <= 1'bx;
	endcase
end

endmodule
```
This code now has an input of base_enum that can have an enumerated value of 0 or 1. The output_signal output will toggle between 0 and 1 based on the input base_enum. If it receives a value outside of {0, 1}, it will output the value 'x'. This test should cover all possible values for enum coverage.

Please replace the Clock_Prog M1 (clk); with clock_prog M1 (clk, base_enum, output_signal); in the testbench code. The testbench code would look something like this:
```Verilog
module t_Clock_Prog ();
wire clock;
reg base_enum; // Change this according to your clock_prog module
wire output_signal;

initial #100 $finish;
Clock_Prog M1 (clk, base_enum, output_signal);
endmodule
```
This code will produce a clock signal, send it to Clock_Prog module and observe the output_signal. Please ensure that the clock_prog module is correctly instantiated in the testbench before running it. In this case, since the input base_enum is a non-default type, the design should be checked for enumerated values and all possible values covered. This code will cover all possible values for base_enum.

Note: The Verilog syntax for enum is different from the C++ one. Therefore, the syntax is slightly altered in the example. This example assumes you have a base_enum input that can take the values 0 or 1. The output_signal output will be driven by the value of base_enum. If base_enum is not 0 or 1, the output will be 'x' which
