Verilog does not have a built-in method to create an array of packed structures directly within a module. We can create a module with packed structure as an output using the following approach:

First, define a packed structure with 32 fields:
```verilog
typedef struct packed {
  logic [1:0] a;
  logic [1:0] b;
  logic [1:0] c;
  logic [1:0] d;
  logic [1:0] e;
  logic [1:0] f;
  logic [1:0] g;
  logic [1:0] h;
  logic [1:0] i;
  logic [1:0] j;
  logic [1:0] k;
  logic [1:0] l;
  logic [1:0] m;
  logic [1:0] n;
  logic [1:0] o;
  logic [1:0] p;
  logic [1:0] q;
  logic [1:0] r;
  logic [1:0] s;
  logic [1:0] t;
  logic [1:0] u;
  logic [1:0] v;
  logic [1:0] w;
  logic [1:0] x;
  logic [1:0] y;
  logic [1:0] z;
  logic [1:0] aa;
  logic [1:0] ab;
  logic [1:0] ac;
  logic [1:0] ad;
  logic [1:0] ae;
  logic [1:0] af;
  logic [1:0] ag;
  logic [1:0] ah;
} Struct32; 
```

Then, create a module with the above defined packed structure as an output:

```verilog
module netdelay1(x,y);
input x;
output Struct32 y;

wire #(2,1) nn; // Declare wire 'nn' with rise=2, fall=1 delay
not (nn,x); // Assign NOT(x) to 'nn' (takes effect after rise/
