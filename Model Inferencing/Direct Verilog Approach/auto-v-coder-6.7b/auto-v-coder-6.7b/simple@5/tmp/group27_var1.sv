In this modified code, we are making use of a packed type to allow the inputs to be transferred as a single value. The inputs are then connected to the module instance to test struct signal routing. The output signals are also changed to reg type to facilitate better debugging.

This modified code will test the given HA using packed structs and showcase output results. This can be useful in verifying the performance of struct-based signal routing for complex digital systems.

Please note that the behavior of the hardware will not change and the simulation results will still be the same. The only difference is how we're handling the inputs and outputs. This is a good way to learn how to work with packed structs and to understand how they can be used to handle complex data types in Verilog. ### End

Also, please ensure that your HA module is defined correctly and that it behaves as
