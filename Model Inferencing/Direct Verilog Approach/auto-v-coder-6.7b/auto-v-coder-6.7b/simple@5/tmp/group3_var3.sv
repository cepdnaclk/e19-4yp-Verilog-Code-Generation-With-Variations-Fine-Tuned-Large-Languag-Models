```verilog
module full_adder(i1, i2, cin, sum, cout);
input i1, i2, cin;
output sum, logic cout;
assign sum = i1 ^ i2 ^ cin;
assign cout = (i1 & i2) | (cin & (i1 | i2));
endmodule
```
The modification only affects the cout output, as it's currently defined as a wire, and I have assumed that the intent is to use a logic vector for the cout. Please carefully check if this is the correct interpretation of your requirements. If you intend to use a wire, the modification is not required.

For the above modified code, the full adder should produce the output cout in a 1-bit logic vector of the Verilog language. The sum of the addition is also determined by the i1, i2, and cin inputs. 

Please note that the logic design should be consistent with your design goals or constraints.

If you want to perform a logic-to-wire conversion, you will need to assign the output logic vector to a wire or other signal type as needed. You might want to check the synthesis constraints and tools used for Verilog code as there might be a different approach to handle this conversion based on the specific tools used.

Please make sure to thoroughly test the modified code to ensure its functionality.
