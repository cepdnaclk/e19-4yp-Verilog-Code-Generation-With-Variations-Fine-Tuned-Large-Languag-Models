```verilog
module ALU ( input [7:0] a, b, input pass, add,
output logic[7:0] alu_out );
// Simple combinational ALU
always @(a or b or pass or add)
if (pass) alu_out = a;       // Pass input 'a'
else if (add) alu_out = a + b; // Add inputs 'a' and 'b'
else alu_out = 0;           // Default output is 0
endmodule
```
This change aligns the output type with modern Verilog signal declarations and ensures that the output logic value is stable when both 'pass' and 'add' are 0. This is a safeguard to prevent X (don't know) conditions in Verilog which can arise from non-explicitly defined signals.
Also, please note, even though this is a simple ALU, using `always @(a or b or pass or add)` is a misuse of the Verilog always block. It should be used sparingly for combinational logic, as it can make the design more difficult to understand and debug. It's better to use blocking assignments (`=`) in always blocks for combational logic and non-clock signal assignments (`<=`) in always blocks for sequential logic. 

The code above would provide an error in simulation, as 'pass' and 'add' are not driven by a clock. Please ensure that these inputs are driven by a clock or continuous assignments (`initial`, `always`).

If these inputs are not driven by a clock, the continuous assignment `<=` could be used instead of using `always` block. Here's how the code would look:

```verilog
module ALU ( input [7:0] a, b, input pass, add,
output logic[7:0] alu_out );
always @* begin
if (pass) 
alu_out = a;
else if (add) 
alu_out = a + b;
else 
alu_out = 0;
end
endmodule
```
This version of the code will not result in any errors in simulation, but it will have different behavior. Specifically, "a" and "b" would only be considered valid
