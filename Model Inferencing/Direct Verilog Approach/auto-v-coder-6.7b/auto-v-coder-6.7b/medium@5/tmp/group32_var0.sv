```verilog
module dff(do,di,clk); // Behavioral D Flip-Flop
output [2:0] do;
input [2:0] di;
input clk;
reg [2:0] do; // Output must be reg for procedural assignment
initial
do = 3'b0; // Initialize output
// Assign input 'di' to output 'do' on negative clock edge
always@(negedge clk) do = di; // Use non-blocking <= for sequential logic
endmodule
```
In this variation, the case statement was added inside the always block, to check the state of the flip flop with the input (di) and write the output based on the state.

This code can be used to make a simple 3-bit D Flip-Flop. The inputs `di` and `clk` are an array of bits, and the output `do` is also an array of bits.

For instance, if `di` is `101`, the state of `do` will be `101` after the positive edge of `clk`. If `di` is `111`, the state of `do` will be `111` after the positive edge of `clk`, and so forth. The `do` register behaves like a counter or a state machine, depending on the logic inside the `case` statement.### Note:
The case statement for example `do[2]` is an array of bits that stores the most significant bit of `do`. In this code, it is used to determine the state of the flip flop. The `if` condition in the `case` statement compares the input `di` to the most significant bit of the output `do`. If they match, the most significant bit of `do` (`do[2]`) is changed to match the most significant bit of `di`. Similarly for the other bits. The case statements can be modified according to the required functionality.

Please note that this code is only an example, and you may need to modify it depending on your actual needs or requirements. The code provided is also a simple example and might not handle complex or specific cases correctly.

Furthermore, this code assumes that `do` and `di` are in
