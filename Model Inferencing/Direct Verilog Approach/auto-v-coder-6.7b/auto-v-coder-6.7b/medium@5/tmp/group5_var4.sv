Here is a modified version of your code that includes an index into a 2D logic array and procedural assignments.

```verilog
`define SIZE 10
module test_k;

logic  [`SIZE - 1 : 0] [`SIZE - 1 : 0] arr;   // create a 2D array
logic [`SIZE - 1 : 0] i;  // declare an index

wire q, clock, j, k, preset, clear;
reg j, k;
jkEdgeFF jk(q, clock, j, k, preset, clear);  // instantiate JK flip-flop
initial
begin
   reset_ff;  // call a reset_ff procedure
   j = 1;
   k = 0;
   i = 0;   // start the index at 0
end

always @(posedge clock) begin  // assign every positive edge of clock
    arr[i][i] = 1;  // assign the value 1 to the i-th row and i-th column
    i = i + 1;    // increment the index
end

m555 timer(clock);  // instantiate a M555 timer

task reset_ff;  // create a task for resetting the flip-flop
   j <= 0;
   k <= 0;
endtask

endmodule
```

This code creates a 2D array and a procedural assignment to the array. The procedural assignment is done in the clock edge. This modification tests the behavior of Modified Dynamic Array (MDA). Please note that this behavior is not standard SystemVerilog and might not be supported by all tools. If your tool does not support MDA, you may want to consider dropping the use of MDA.

Please replace `m555` with the actual module name you have used for the M555 timer. If you have not used any timer, you should replace it with a suitable module that produces a clock signal. 

Also, consider that the `reset_ff` procedure is not defined in your original code. You should define it or replace the code in the `reset_ff` call with an appropriate reset procedure or logic for your circuit.
