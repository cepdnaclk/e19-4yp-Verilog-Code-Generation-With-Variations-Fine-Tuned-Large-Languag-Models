```verilog
module aoi2(g,a,b,c,d);
output g;
input a,b,c,d;
wire e,f,g1; // Intermediate signals
// Dataflow assignments for AND, OR, and NOT operations
assign e = a && b;
assign f = c && d;
assign g1 = e || f;
assign g = ~g1; // Final AOI output

// Initialization using function call with an inside expression
initial begin
    e <= a && b;
    f <= c && d;
    g1 <= e || f;
    g <= ~g1; // Final AOI output
end
endmodule
```
This code is a modified version of the original code snippet. The initial block is used to initialize the intermediate signals `e`, `f`, and `g1` in the module. The assignment statements are in the initial block to ensure that these signals are initialized before the simulation starts. This variation allows the system to assign the data to intermediate signals without the need for a clock edge.

Please note that this will not run a simulation, as it's a static Verilog construct. It will only initialize variables at the start of the module definition. 

For a simulation to occur, we would need to use Verilog/SystemVerilog to control the simulation using a clock, which would allow the signals to change on every clock edge. 

For running a simulation in a simulation tool, the above code should be altered to include system tasks to drive inputs and print/monitor outputs.

This example is illustrative and does not apply to real-world hardware design. It is also important to note that the Verilog simulation system does not support the use of assign operators in the initial block. This would need to be changed if attempting to run a Verilog simulation. 

Also, systemVerilog allows using these assignments in tasks or functions in the initial block, which can facilitate a more complex or dynamic simulation. However, these assignments do not directly output to an output pin. They would typically be used to calculate parameters for the output, and then the output pin would be driven using these calculated parameters. This is not directly related to the AOI2 logic gate, but it would be applicable in a real-world scenario.
