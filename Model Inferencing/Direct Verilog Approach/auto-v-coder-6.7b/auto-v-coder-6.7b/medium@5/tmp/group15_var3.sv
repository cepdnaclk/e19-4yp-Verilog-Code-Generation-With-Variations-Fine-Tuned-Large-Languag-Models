    case (mode)
        0: ALUout = left + right;
        1: ALUout = left - right;
        2: ALUout = left & right;

This code takes an 8-bit number, left and right, along with a 2-bit operation mode and outputs an 8-bit number, ALUout, using a combinational always_comb block. Each case statement performs the appropriate operation.

The left and right inputs are concatenated with the ALUout output. The operation performed depends on the mode input.

This code can be used in a synthesizable design as it does not access any combinational logic block or primitive type. The only combinational logic involved is for the case statement. This approach is suitable for most basic operations and structures, but may not meet the needs of complex, high-performance designs.

In synthesizable designs, it is frequently recommended to use the built-in Verilog primitives (like ADD, SUB, AND, OR) instead of using case statement for simple arithmetic operations. This is because the synthesis tools can optimize the design better, which can result in reduced power consumption and improved performance.

This code also uses a Verilog case statement, which is more flexible and scalable and can handle a wider array of operations. However, it's important to note that case statements in Verilog can be less efficient than direct primitive operations.

Therefore, depending on the specific needs of a given design, the code can be tweaked to maximize efficiency.

Also, you should always include the timescale directive in your Verilog design, which specifies the time unit and precision of your design. This helps when you convert your design to an equivalent netlist file.

Finally, remember to check your design for correctness and completeness before synthesizing.

Note: Since this code is a basic implementation, there is no error checking for the inputs. In a real
