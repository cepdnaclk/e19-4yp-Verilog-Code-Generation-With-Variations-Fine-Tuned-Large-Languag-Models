```verilog
module counter(
    input wire clk, rst,
    output reg [3:0] count
);

reg [7:0] array [0:15];
reg [3:0] result;

always @(posedge clk or posedge rst) begin
    if (rst) count <= 4'b0000;
    else count <= count + 1;
end

initial begin
    for (int i=0; i<16; i++) begin
        array[i] = i;
    end
    result = array[15][3:0];
end

endmodule
```
This code adds an initial block of code to initialize an array with its index values, then assigns the result of array[15][3:0] through a reg variable to allow simulation.

This is a simple example of how to embed an array initialization inside Verilog code and use it in the simulation environment. Note that Verilog simulation does not support arrays of wire type directly, so we use a reg type array instead. The result is then assigned to a wire type variable which can then be used for simulation in other HDL languages. 

Remember the Verilog always block works over continuous clock cycles which in this code is posedge clk or posedge rst. So if you want to see the output of `result`, you need to add a `$display` command inside this block or use another mechanism to see the value of `result`.
