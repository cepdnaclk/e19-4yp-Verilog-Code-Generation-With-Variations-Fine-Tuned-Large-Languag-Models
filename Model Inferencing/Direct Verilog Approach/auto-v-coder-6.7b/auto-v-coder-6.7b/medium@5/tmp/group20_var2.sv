```verilog
module Chap1Counter (Clk, Reset, Count);
input Clk, Reset;
output [3:0] Count;
reg [3:0] Count;
always @(posedge Clk or posedge Reset) begin
    if(Reset) Count = 'b1; // reset to binary 1
    else Count = Count + 1;
    // procedural assignment inside a final block
    final begin
        Count[1:0] = 'b01;
    end
end
endmodule
```

In this code, the procedural assignment `Count[1:0] = 'b01;` is included inside the `final` block. This assignment ensures that the lower two bits of the `Count` register are set to 'b01' (i.e., '1') at the end of the simulation. This variation is useful for debugging purposes. The reset to '1' is also included in the `final` block to ensure the expected final state is consistent with the expected reset state. The modified code is intended to demonstrate the use of procedural assignments inside a `final` block, and not representative of any specific design or functionality.
