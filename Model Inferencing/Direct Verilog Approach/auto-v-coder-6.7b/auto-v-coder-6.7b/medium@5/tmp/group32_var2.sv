```verilog

output [1:0] do;
input [1:0] di;
input clk;
reg [1:0] do; // Output must be reg for procedural assignment
initial

// Assign input 'di' to output 'do' on negative clock edge
always@(negedge clk) begin
  do <= di; // Use non-blocking <= for sequential logic
end
endmodule

module dff_array(do,di,clk); // Behavioral D Flip-Flop
output [7:0] do;
input [7:0] di;
input clk;
reg [7:0] do; // Output must be reg for procedural assignment

```
This code introduces the array notation in the inputs and outputs of the modules. It also introduces the "case" statement which is used to select a value from a set of possibilities based on a condition. 

The first example uses a 2-bit output and a 2-bit input for the D Flip-Flop. The second example uses a 8-bit output and a 8-bit input for the D Flip-Flop. 

Please note that the case statement is not used in this example, but it's added for demonstration purposes. It's not necessary in a simple D Flip-Flop module.### 

To run this code, you can use any available simulator like Icarus Verilog or Questasim. The code is ready for simulation and synthesis.

### Note:
Please ensure to replace the values in the module declaration with the corresponding values. Also, for correct behavior, please provide suitable range and type of array for both input and output of the flip-flop. 

The case statement is not used in this example, but it's added for demonstration purposes.

The code is not fully optimized and is intended
