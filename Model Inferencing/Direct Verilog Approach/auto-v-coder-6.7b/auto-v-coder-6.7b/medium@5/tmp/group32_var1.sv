```verilog
module dff (do, di, clk);
  output reg [7:0] do;
  input [7:0] di;
  input clk;
  
  always @(negedge clk) begin
    case (di) inside 
      [0:8'h0F, 10:10'hFF]: do <= 8'h2A;
      [11:11'h1FF, 13:18'h2FFF]: do <= 8'h3A;
      default: do <= 8'hFF;
    endcase
  end
endmodule
```
In this modified code, a D Flip-Flop is simulated with a case statement. The input and output signals are declared as integer arrays with a specific range. The non-blocking operator <= is used to assign the output to the input on negative clock edge. The case statement is used to selectively assign values to output based on the input range. If the input value falls within the specified ranges, it will be assigned to the output. If the input value doesn't fall within any of the specified ranges, the default assignment is made.

Please note that Verilog does not support dynamic range with case statement. If you are dealing with ranges, then you need to use a for loop or a lookup table. Also, this code does not instantiate the dff module. It is a simple example and can be instantiated inside a larger design.

Remember that the clock signal should not be a constant signal. It should be a clock port to the module. 

The modified code is synthesizable. It will execute the case statement on each negedge of the clock. It will selectively assign values to the output based on the input value ranges. If there is no match, it will default to 8'hFF. 

This is a basic example and can be modified according to the specific requirement of the task. However, please note that Verilog is a hardware description language for designing hardware circuits and systems. It provides a lot of flexibility and versatility but it also brings a lot of complexity. The hardware design and simulation of Verilog can be a complex task. Thus, this code is designed for understanding the basic concepts of Verilog and is not synthesizable. 

It is recommended to use
