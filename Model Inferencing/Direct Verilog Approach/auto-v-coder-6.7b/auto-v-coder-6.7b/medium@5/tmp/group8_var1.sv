```verilog
module tst_dec2_4beh();
wire [3:0]o;
reg[1:0] i;
//reg en; // Enable not used in dec2_4beh
dec2_4beh dec(o,i);
initial
begin
i =2'b00;
end
initial
begin
#1;
if (i[1])
begin
$display("%b should be 1", i);
end
else
begin
$display("%b should be 0", i);
end
$finish;
end
initial $monitor ($time, " output o = %b, input i = %b ", o,i);
initial #14 $stop; // Stop simulation
endmodule
```
In the above code, an if statement is added after 1 time unit. The if statement checks if the second bit of the `i` input is set. If it is, a message indicating that the second bit of `i` should be `1`, otherwise the message indicates that the second bit of `i` should be `0`. After that, simulation is stopped to prevent it from running indefinitely.

This code will help validate the correctness and functionality of the `dec2_4beh` module in terms of its outputs using the specified inputs. If the inputs and outputs are correctly connected and if the module is functioning correctly, this if statement will print the appropriate message based on the input. Otherwise, it will indicate that the condition failed.### 

Please note that Verilog does not support a wait statement like `wait(i[1]==1);`, which will stop the simulation until the condition `i[1]==1` holds true. To simulate this behaviour, a delay of 1 time unit must be used instead. In addition, the `if/else` construct is used to print the appropriate message based on the condition. 

Remember to replace the value of `2'b00` in `i =2'b00;` with the value you expect the output to be when the input is equal to `2'b00`. 

This modified code will be useful for validation purposes and debugging during the simulation.

Additionally, you may want to replace `$display` with `$write` or
