```verilog
module RAM (output[7:0] Obus, input[7:0] Ibus, input[3:0] Adr, input Clk, Read);
reg[7:0] Storage[15:0];
reg[7:0] ObusReg;
assign #1 Obus = ObusReg;
always @(posedge Clk)
begin
    if (Read==1'b0)
        Storage[Adr] <= Ibus;
    else
        ObusReg <= Storage[Adr];

    // Introduce a while loop condition
    while(Storage[Adr] <= 10) begin
        // Assign a constant range to the array
        Storage[Adr] <= Storage[Adr] + 1;
    end
end
endmodule
```

In the modified code, we introduce a while loop condition that will keep looping until the value at the address in the array is 10. Inside the loop, we assign that the value at that address is incremented by 1. Please note that this is a simple example. In real world scenarios, the loop condition should be adjusted according to the requirements. Also, keep in mind that while loop is not supported in Verilog. This is just for demonstration purpose.### Original and Modified Code Comparasion:

In the original and modified code, the difference is that the modified code incorporates a while loop with a conditional inside. While loop is used here to prevent it from going on indefinitely and the loop stops when the value in the array is 10. The while loop is designed to increase the value in the array at the required address by 1, and it repeats this operation until it reaches 10. This is just for demonstration and not a practical application. Please be aware that while loop is not supported in Verilog and this example would not compile or run correctly in real-time implementation.### To summarize, the modified code effectively illustrates the possibility of using a while loop in conjunction with other logical operations, but it is important to note that this is not part of the Verilog standard and may not work as expected in real-world applications. 

It's important to reiterate that while this example might compile and simulate correctly, it's not a typical or recommended practice for Verilog coding,
