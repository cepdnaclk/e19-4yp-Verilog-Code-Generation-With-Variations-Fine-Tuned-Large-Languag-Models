```verilog
module tst_CMOSsw1();
  reg in,con;
  wire [3:0] out;
  CMOSsw1 cmsw(out,in,con); // Instantiate CMOS switch
  initial begin 
    in=1'b0; 
    con=1'b1; 
  end // Start enabled
  
  always #5 in =~in; // Toggle data
  always #3 con=~con; // Toggle control
  
  initial begin
    assert(out[1:3] == {out[1], out[2], out[3]}) 
    else $error("Function call result indexed into an array does not match a slice range");
  end
  
  initial $monitor($time, "in = %b, con = %b, output = %b ",in,con,out);
  initial #20 $stop; // Stop simulation
endmodule
```

In this modified code, the `assert` instruction is used to validate the condition defined after it. If this condition is false, the simulation stops and the error message is printed to the error stream. In this case, the condition checks if the output bits 1 through 3 (`out[1:3]`) are equal to the bits 1 and 2 of the output (`{out[1], out[2], out[3]}`). If this condition fails, the error will be printed. The error message should be a string that describes the condition being checked. In this case, it is "Function call result indexed into an array does not match a slice range". This simulation will stop if the condition fails, showing the error message.

Please, replace the `CMOSsw1` with your module name and `out` with your output wire name. Also, adjust the slice range `out[1:3]` based on your output width. If your output is 4-bit wide, its slice range should be `out[1:3]`. If your output is 8-bit wide, its slice range should be `out[3:5]`.

This modified code is used for simulation and verification purposes only. Please, make sure to test this on your hardware and software environment before the hardware implementation. This is just a
