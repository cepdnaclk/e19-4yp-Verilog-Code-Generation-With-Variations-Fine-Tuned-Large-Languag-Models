```verilog
module dff_with_reset(data, clock, r, out);
input clock, r, data;
output out;
reg out;
always @(posedge clock or posedge r)
begin
if (r)
out = 0;
else
begin
    integer i;
    for(i=0; i<out.size(); i=i+1) begin
        out[i] = data[i];
    end
end
end
endmodule
```
This code creates a flip-flop that will store the value of 'data' when 'r' is at 1. If 'r' is at 0, the flip-flop will store the value of 'data' inside the 'out' signal. The size of the array in 'data' and 'out' will be the same because they are supposed to be equal in size and data transfer is bitwise. The integer 'i' is used to iterate through the size of 'out' array. 

Please note that the use of'size()' function is Verilog's built-in function to determine the number of elements in an array. Be sure to replace 'out.size()' with the actual function call if it is different in your specific Verilog context.###```verilog
