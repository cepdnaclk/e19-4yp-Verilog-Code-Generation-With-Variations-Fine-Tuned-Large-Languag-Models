This code will perform 4 types of arithmetic operations on two 8-bit inputs: addition, subtraction, bitwise AND and bitwise OR. The result is stored in the 8-bit output. The operation mode is determined by the mode input. The operation is performed using Verilog's built-in operators for arithmetic and bitwise operations. The always_comb block is used to create a combinatorial logic with an implicit sensitivity list. The sensitivity list refers to the signals that, when changed, cause the logic to recalculate its value. The changes detected by the always_comb block are then used to trigger the operations. In this case, the sensitivity list is the mode, left, and right signals. The always_comb block ensures that the operations are only executed when the values of these signals change.

Note: The code is modified to include the input ports and output ports explicitly as this is a common practice in Verilog. Also, it is important to note that this code will give X as output if an invalid mode is selected, which is the default case in the switch statement. If you want to give a specific value when an invalid mode is selected, you can add an additional default case or condition that handles this.

Please replace the existing code with the above code. This will provide you with the most efficient and clean Verilog code possible. `always_comb` is a directive that allows you to optimize your code and design a cleaner and simpler design. 

Inside such structure, there is only one case statement, which is a good programming practice. Such structures are easier to read, debug and enhance. This code also includes the necessary logic operations as you have defined in the
