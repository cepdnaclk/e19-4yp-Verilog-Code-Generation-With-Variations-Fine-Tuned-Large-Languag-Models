```Verilog
timescale 1ns/100ps
module ShiftRegister8 (input sl, sr, clk, input [7:0] ParIn, input [1:0] m, output reg [7:0] ParOut);
always @(negedge clk) begin
    case (m)
        0: ParOut <= ParOut;
        1: ParOut <= {sl, ParOut[7:1]};
        2: ParOut <= {ParOut[6:0], sr};
        3: ParOut <= ParIn;
        default: ParOut <= 8'bX;
    endcase
end
endmodule
```
### Explanation:
In this solution, the case statement is unchanged, but the'm' signal is added to the 'ParOut' assignment. This is done using the inside operator `inside`, which returns true if the'm' signal is in the range of [0,3].

Here is the modified code:
```Verilog
timescale 1ns/100ps
module ShiftRegister8 (input sl, sr, clk, input [7:0] ParIn, input [1:0] m, output reg [7:0] ParOut);
always @(negedge clk) begin
    if (m inside {[0:3]}) begin
        case (m)
            0: ParOut <= ParOut;
            1: ParOut <= {sl, ParOut[7:1]};
            2: ParOut <= {ParOut[6:0], sr};
            3: ParOut <= ParIn;
            default: ParOut <= 8'bX;
        endcase
    end else begin
        ParOut <= 8'bX;
    end
end
endmodule
```
In this version, the case statement is only executed if'm' is in the range of [0, 3]. If'm' is outside this range, the 'ParOut' value is set to an unspecified state. This modification is useful for improving readability and preventing errors when the'm' value is greater than 3 or less than 0.

When the simulation tool is run, it will generate warnings if'm' goes out of the allowed range
