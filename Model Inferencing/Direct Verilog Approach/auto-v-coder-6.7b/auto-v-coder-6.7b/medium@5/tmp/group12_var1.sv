```
module maj3 (a, b, c, y);
input [3:0] a;
output reg y;
wire [2:0] im1, im2, im3;
always @(*) begin
    {im1[2:0], im2[2:0], im3[2:0]} <= {a[1] & a[2], a[2] & a[3], a[3] & a[1]};
    y <= |im1 | im2 | im3;
end
endmodule
```
This code will create an array of four inputs, representing the 4-bit binary input. Then the code will implement a modified version of the majority function (maj3). This code creates separate wire arrays for each input, calculates their value based on the input values, and outputs the result. This should help to model the behaviour of the original code.

Please note that the 'input a, b, c' part of the original code is replaced with 'input [3:0] a;'. The always @(*) block is used because a continuous assignment statement doesn't allow for an indexed assignment. The always @(*) block will continuously execute when the inputs a, b, and c change.

The modified code also uses a constant range for the index. This is used to assign the correct bits of the 4-bit input to their corresponding wires. The indexed assignment inside the always @(*) block will calculate the majority of the inputs and assign the result to the output 'y'.

To sum up, this code will now simulate the behaviour of the original Verilog code in a more structured way. It does not exactly replicate the original but does accurately capture the functionality. 

Testbench code will follow shortly, but the main idea is to test it by setting input values and observing the output change. These test values will be the majority of the inputs, and the output y will be set to the majority of their values.

Also note that this modified code is specific to the Verilog code provided. If the original code was more complex or uses different logic, you may want to refactor the code to better suit your specific needs.

Please replace the 'always @(*)' block with 'always @(a or b or c)' if you want it to only execute when any of the inputs changes.
