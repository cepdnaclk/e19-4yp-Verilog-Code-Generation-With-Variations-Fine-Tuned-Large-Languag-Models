This version of the module provides the same functionality as the original, but it employs a case statement to dynamically select the index of the array based on the input signal `s`. It is a useful variation if you wish to modify the code to test the functionality of the module with more dynamic configurations or to add additional functionality.

Keep in mind that this code will only be synthesizable if you are using a Verilog simulator or synthesis tool that supports Verilog `case` statements. Some tools, such as Verilator, may not support this type of construct.

In terms of synthesis tools, many synthesizers do not support case statement inside always block, but it's a widely accepted practice to use switch-case construct instead of case statements. Also, this code is more complex than the original version and may increase the area of your chip, so it's always a good idea to choose a version that best fits the target hardware and requirements.
