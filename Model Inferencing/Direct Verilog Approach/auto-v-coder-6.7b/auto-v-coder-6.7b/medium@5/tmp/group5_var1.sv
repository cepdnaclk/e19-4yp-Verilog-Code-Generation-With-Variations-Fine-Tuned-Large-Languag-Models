```verilog
module test_k;
wire q, clock, j, k, preset, clear;
reg j, k;
jkEdgeFF jk(q, clock, j, k, preset, clear);
// Assign values to test MDA behavior
logic [1:0][1:0] test_array;
initial begin
reset_ff;
j = 1;
k = 0;
test_array[0][0] = 1'b1;
test_array[0][1] = 1'b0;
end
m555 timer(clock);
endmodule
```

This code adds a variable `test_array` that matches the expected shape of the multi-dimensional array. The array is then initialized with values using procedural assignments. This is a simple test to verify that the code will run correctly and can be used to test different scenarios. Modify the indices and values to test different scenarios.

Note: This code should be used for testing purposes only and does not accurately reflect the actual behavior of multi-dimensional arrays in Verilog. It is not a recommended practice for actual hardware design. It is a demonstration of how one might use procedural assignments within a Verilog module to test their understanding of multi-dimensional arrays.
