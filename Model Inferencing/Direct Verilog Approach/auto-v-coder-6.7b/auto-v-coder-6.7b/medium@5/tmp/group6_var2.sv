  reg clk;
  reg [3:0] count;
  reg en;

  function int get_period(); // Function to calculate the period based on the count value
    return count * 2; // Returns the period value
  endfunction

  always @(posedge en)
    for (int i=0; i<10; i++) // Loop count for the first 10 periods
      #get_period() clk = ~clk; // Toggle clock every calculated period

  initial
  begin
    clk = 1'b0; // Initialize clock
    count = 4'd0; // Initialize count
    en = 1'b0; // Start disabled
  end

  initial
    $monitor("clk=%b, t=%0d, en=%b ", clk, $time, en);

  initial
  begin
    en = 1'b1; // Enable clock generation
    #10; // Delay for 10 time units
    count = count + 1; // Increase the period
    #10; // Delay for 10 time units
    count = count + 1; // Increase the period again
    #10; // Delay for 10 time units
  end
endmodule
```

In this modified version, the clock is toggled every "period" time units where the period increases every time the `count` is incremented after an `en` delay. The period is calculated with the `get_period` function, which returns the period value. The `count` variable is then used to adjust the period. The `en` signal is used to start and stop the clock generation process. The initial task is used to set the `en` signal to 1, which enables the clock generation. After 10 time units, the `count` is incremented twice to adjust the period. Therefore, the clock will be toggled twice, for a total of 10 periods. The $monitor task prints the value of `clk`, the current time, and the value of `en` at each time step.

Note: This code does not guarantee that the clock will be toggled exactly at
