```verilog

module maj3_p (input a, b, c, output y);
wire im1, im2, im3;
parameter
    tplh1=2, tphl1=4,
    tplh2=3, tphl2=5;
and #(tplh1, tphl1)
    (im1, a, b),
    (im2, b, c),
    (im3, c, a);
or #(tplh2, tphl2) (y, im1, im2, im3);
always @(a or b or c) begin
  // assign some_output = func(a, b, c);
end
endmodule
```
### Explanation:
The modified version of the module does not change the functionality of the original module. The `always` block is an implicit sensitivity list that causes the design to re-evaluate whenever any of the three inputs `a`, `b`, `c` changes. The output `y` is also updated accordingly.

This variation is just an example, not valid Verilog. It cannot be compiled or simulated because it contains a syntax error: `assign some_output = func(a, b, c);`. Assigning a value to a variable inside an always block is not allowed in Verilog. If this code is to be executed, the function `func` would need to be defined elsewhere and it would have to be called inside the always block, which is not provided in the initial code. 

The goal is to demonstrate how the sensitivity list in the `always` block can be used for triggering function calls and other operations based on the change of specific input values. This can be helpful in complex designs where re-calculation is needed for certain input values. In the original code, the block does not change the output because it is an incomplete instruction.

In this modified code, the `always` block is still there but it is empty and thus does not contain any function calls or assignments. The original functionality of the module is preserved. It's recommended to use the sensitivity list properly to match the actual requirements.
