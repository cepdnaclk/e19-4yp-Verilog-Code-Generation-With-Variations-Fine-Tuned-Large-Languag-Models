```Verilog
module test_k;
wire q, clock, j, k, preset, clear;
reg j, k;
jkEdgeFF jk(q, clock, j, k, preset, clear);
logic [3:0] [2:0] testArray;
initial
begin
reset_ff;
j = 1;
k = 0;
testArray[2][1] = 1'bz;
end
m555 timer(clock);
endmodule
```
In the above code, a 4x3 2D logic array testArray is declared. Then in the initial block a constant index (2,1) is assigned the value 1'bz (unassigned) to demonstrate the MDA behavior. This test should be performed in a hardware simulator or FPGA to see the actual effect.

Please note that the actual behavior of the specific logic (e.g., JK flip-flop) may not be directly impacted by the assignment at the index [2][1], but the assignment demonstrates how to use procedural assignment for testing purpose. It is important to note that procedural assignments are not expected to be synthesized into physical hardware, but rather are used for testbench and design verification.

Also, this test is only applicable for 4-bit synchronous arrays. For 8-bit, 16-bit, and more, the syntax and indexing would change, and the assignment is not applicable. Hence it depends on the specific dimensions of the testArray.

Remember to replace `reset_ff` with the correct reset function/procedure for your specific use case.

Please note that this sample code is aimed at illustrating procedural assignments. The actual correctness and performance of the design will depend on the specific use case, including the actual behavior of the JK flip-flop module.

In general, for testing the behavior of individual gates, modules, or other digital logic, it is recommended to use a combination of simulation strategies and verification methods. This includes assertions, automatic checks, and/or checking the outputs against known results. This is a more typical way to test Verilog code. However, the procedural assignment demonstrated here is not something you would typically use for such testing in Verilog. Instead, you would use more rigorous simulation and verification methods such as using
