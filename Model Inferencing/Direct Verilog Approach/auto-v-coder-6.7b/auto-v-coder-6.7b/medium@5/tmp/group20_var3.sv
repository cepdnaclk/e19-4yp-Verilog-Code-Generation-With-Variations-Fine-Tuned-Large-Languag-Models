```verilog
module Chap1Counter (Clk, Reset, Count);
    input Clk, Reset;
    output reg [3:0] Count; // Change the data type to reg (for variable assignment).
    always @(posedge Clk) begin
        if(Reset) begin
            // Resetting to 0.
            Count <= 0;
        end else begin
            // Incrementing Count by 1.
            Count <= Count + 1;
        end
    end
endmodule
```
The above code will make the count of the counter reset to zero when the reset signal is high, and increment the count by 1 every positive edge of the clock.

The reason to change the data type from `output [3:0] Count` to `output reg [3:0] Count` is to make Verilog understand the variable is a register, which is more efficient for combinational logic since the tool will not generate any flop for this type of variable.

Please also note that the procedural assignment inside the final block using inside on a packed vector array slice is not valid in Verilog. This is a verilog specific feature and not widely supported in other languages like C, C++, Java etc. 

The final block is used for synthesis optimization in Verilog HDL. The procedural assignment inside the final block is not synthesized because synthesis generates the equivalent code for it at the top level of the module. The procedural assignments are used to describe the behavior of the module and are not part of the hardware model.

If this block's final assignment is used in a non-synthesizable manner or an actual hardware model, it may be necessary to break it down into separate assignments or signals. In many cases, it should be avoided. It's typically recommended to use combinational assignments to implement such behavior.

Also, note that since the design cannot handle the type logic [3:0], you would need to change the type to logic or assign it a different size if you want to use the counter in a different context.

Remember that Verilog is a hardware description language, and the procedural assignments inside the final block might not be supported in other languages. If your code is being used in other hardware design languages such as VHDL or SystemVerilog, you might need different code.
