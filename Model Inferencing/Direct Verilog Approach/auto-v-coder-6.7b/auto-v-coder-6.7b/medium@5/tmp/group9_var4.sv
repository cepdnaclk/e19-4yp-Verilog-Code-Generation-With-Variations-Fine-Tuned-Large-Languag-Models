Modify the base code to generate an array of pulses as follows:

```verilog
module pulses; 
  reg [8:0] I;
  reg [100:0] pulses_array;
  initial
    begin 
      while (I<100) begin 
        pulses_array[I] = I[1]; // Assign bit 1 of I to the corresponding bit in the pulses_array
        I = I + 1; 
      end
    end
  initial I=0; 
  initial #100 $stop; 
endmodule
```
This will generate an array of pulses where each bit in the pulses_array represents the value of the corresponding bit in the 9-bit register I.

Note that in the original Verilog code, the index to the array was out-of-range, hence the correction in the code. The modified code now correctly uses the bit positioning, making sure that it is consistent with the indexing used in the array. Please adjust the length of the pulses_array as per your requirements.

Also, please ensure that the number of iterations in the while loop is less or equal to the size of the array to avoid out-of-bounds array indexing. In this case, the loop stops after 100 iterations and the array size is 100 bits wide. If you need more or fewer bits, increase or decrease the size of the array accordingly.###

Note: This code is not synthesizable as synthesis tools, like Icarus or Verilator, interpret array indices differently from standard Verilog. For synthesis purposes, you might need to rewrite the code to avoid array indices larger than the array width. In this case, synthesis won't work since the loop is trying to access I[1], which is out of bounds for a 9-bit register. 

Also, do not forget to consider all possible corner cases in your design. If you are expecting to use this code in other synthesis environments, you may need to adjust it.

If you are not doing simulation, but rather synthesizing this code, you'd need to ensure it's written correctly for synthesis tools. Hence, ensure you verify that the constraints in the synthesis tool (like Icarus, Verilator, etc.) are compatible with this code. For example,
