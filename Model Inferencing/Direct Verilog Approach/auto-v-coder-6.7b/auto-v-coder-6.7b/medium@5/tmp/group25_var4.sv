```Verilog
module example7_5(x1, x2, x3, Clock, f, g);
parameter N = 3; // Number of signals
input [N-1:0] x; // Inputs x1, x2, x3
input Clock;
output f, g;
reg f, g;
always @(posedge Clock)
begin
    f = x[0] & x[1]; // Select the 0th and 1st element of x array
    g = f | x[2]; // Select the 2nd element of x array
end
endmodule
```
Instead of directly using x1, x2, and x3 as input signals, we use a parameter N to define the number of input signals, and create a 1-dimensional input array x. Then, we select the desired elements of the x array inside the always block using the indexes and define f and g. 

In the example above, x1 and x2 are selected with indexes 0 and 1 respectively (since we are using a 1-based index), and x3 is selected with index 2. This way, all signals can be defined in the same way and we don't need to make any changes to the always block.

This version of the code allows for handling different numbers of input signals and still maintaining the same logic inside the always block. This is a clean way of making the code more flexible and robust.

Also, note that this code is compatible with a SystemVerilog standard and the "old" Verilog syntax would require changing the always block from `always @(posedge Clock)` to `always @(posedge Clock or negedge Clock)`. However, using `posedge Clock` is usually fine in SystemVerilog.

Modified code in SystemVerilog:
```Verilog
module example7_5(x, Clock, f, g);
parameter N = 3; // Number of signals
input [N-1:0] x; // Inputs x1, x2, x3
input Clock;
output reg f, g;
always @(posedge Clock)
begin
    f = x[0] & x[1]; // Select the 0th and 1st element of x array
