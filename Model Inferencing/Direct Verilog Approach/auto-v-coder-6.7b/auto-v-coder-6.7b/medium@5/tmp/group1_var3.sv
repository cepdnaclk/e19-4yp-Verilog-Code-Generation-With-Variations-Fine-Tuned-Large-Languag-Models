In the case statement, the inside operator and the packed vector array select has been used. The case statement is now a range of cases for selecting the bits to be moved depending on the input m. The inside operator is used to select the bits to be moved based on the bit value of the input m. The expression inside the operator returns 1 only when the m value is either 0 or 1, and for the case where m is 2, the expression will return 1 if m[1] (the second bit of m) is 1, and 0 otherwise. This will select the bits to be shifted out when m value is 2. If m value is any other value, the default case will set the output to X.

Please note that the inside operator `: :` is a ternary operator in SystemVerilog. The left side of the `: :` operator is a condition, the second `:` is a separator, and the right side is the value to be selected. The inside operator is particularly useful for creating packed vector array selects in SystemVerilog. The result is a packed vector of the selected elements.

Also, in the original code, the case statement was not using the inside operator correctly. The case statement has been updated to use the inside operator correctly. The case statement now uses the inside operator to select the bits to be shifted in or out based on the input m, to match the functionality of the original code.

NOTE: Depending on the type of `m` and the exact implementation of the original code and the description provided, the modified code may not exactly match the original code in terms of
