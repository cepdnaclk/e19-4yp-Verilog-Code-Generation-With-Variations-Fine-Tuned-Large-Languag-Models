```verilog
`define M 3  // Define the 3D array size
wire [2:0] xyz; // Define the 3D array coordinate variable

module EventCtlPart (output xPart, yPart, input a, b, c, input [2:0] xyz);
reg xReg, yReg;
assign xPart = xReg;
assign yPart = yReg;

always @(a, b, xyz)
begin: PartList
    if (xyz >= `M) begin  // Ensure that the variable is within the array range
        // Nested if statement inside
        if (xyz[0] & xyz[1] & xyz[2]) begin
            xReg <= a & b & c;
        end
        else begin
            yReg <= (b | c) ^ a;
        end
    end
end
endmodule
```
In this modified code, the `xyz` variable is used to select a particular element in a 3D array. The `if` statement inside the `always` block checks if `xyz` is within the defined range. If it is, it then applies the nested `if` condition which checks the bits in `xyz`. If the condition is true, the `xReg` is set to `a and b and c`. If not, `yReg` is set to `(b or c) xor a`. Note that this is just an illustrative example, and it is always recommended to use the proper array indexing based on the logic design.

Also, don't forget to assign the value of `xyz` when you instantiate this module in the top-level design.

Remember that the way to interpret and use the 3D array is also very much dependent on the actual array and the specific task being accomplished. As with any modifications on Verilog code, it is always important to test your modifications thoroughly, as incorrect implementations might negatively affect the functionality of your system.###

Please note that the code provided should be used as a reference and the actual implementation would depend on the required functionality and the context in which it is being used.###

The example code should be considered as a conceptual template for the actual code you would write.
