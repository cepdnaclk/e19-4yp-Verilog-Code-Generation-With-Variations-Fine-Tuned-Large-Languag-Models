```Verilog
module test_array_slice_operand;
reg [7:0] arr[0:9];
reg [3:0] index = 4'd3;
wire [4:0] slice;

initial begin
    // Initialize array
    for(int i=0; i<10; i++) arr[i] = i;

    // Use inside in an if statement on an array slice operand indexed by a variable
    if (arr[index])
        $display("arr[index] is non-zero");
    else
        $display("arr[index] is zero");
        
    // Part-select assign
    if (arr[index][4:0])
        $display("Part select of arr[index] is non-zero");
    else
        $display("Part select of arr[index] is zero");

#10;
$finish;
end
endmodule
```
In the modified code, an array of 10 elements is assigned with values from 0 to 9. The index variable is set to 3. Inside the if condition, the if statement checks if the value at the index is zero or non-zero. The if condition of the part select assigned to the variable slice checks if the part select value is zero or non-zero. The testbench finishes after 10 ns.

Please note that the Verilog testbench simulator does not support array indexes inside an if statement. The above example is to illustrate the concept, not to be used in a real hardware design as it will give an error.

Also, note that the Verilog testbench does not support dynamic indexing which is used in the initial if condition. This is a limitation of the simulator and not a limitation of the language standard.

This is a simplistic example. The actual Verilog design would need to be much more complex and potentially involve multiple modules, memories, and more.

Please refer to the official Verilog-2005 syntax document for more information.### Base Verilog Code:
```verilog
module testbench;

  reg i1, i2;
  wire o;

  wand1 ww(i1, i2, o);

  initial begin
    i1 = 0; i2 =
