```verilog
module mux41b (
input wire [1:0] a,
input wire [1:0] b,
input wire [1:0] c,
input wire [1:0] d,
input wire [1:0] s,
output reg [1:0] y // Output must be reg for procedural assignment
);
always @(*) // Combinational sensitivity
case(s)
2'b00: y = a; // Select a if s=00
2'b01: y = b; // Select b if s=01
2'b10: y = c; // Select c if s=10
2'b11: y = d; // Select d if s=11
endcase
endmodule
```
In this variation, we have extended our 2x1 mux to a 4x1 mux. We have added an additional 2 bits packed array (a, b, c, d) as operands and extended our select (s) from 2 bits to 4 bits. This allows us to select from 16 different combinations, instead of the original 4 from the 2x1 mux. Please note that the select bits (s) must be encoded as a binary number (00, 01, 10, 11). If you were using decimal or hexadecimal values, you would need to convert them to binary. For example, if you wanted to select "b" with "s" = 10 in decimal, you would convert 10 to binary (010) and select "b" with "s" = 010. 

If you were to use a 2x1 mux for selecting from 4 different combinations, the select bits (s) could be encoded as a binary number (0, 1) instead of the 2-bit binary number used here. 

Keep in mind that the complexity of the design and the size of the resulting mux increase with the increase in the number of inputs and outputs, so it's always better to use a minimum number of inputs and outputs which fits in a logic cell. Also, it's important to add proper comments to your code to help others understand what you are doing.
