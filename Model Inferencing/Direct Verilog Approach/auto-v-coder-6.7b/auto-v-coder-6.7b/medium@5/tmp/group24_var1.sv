```verilog
module tst_dff_p_b();
  reg di,clk; wire do;
  dff_p d1(do,di,clk); // Instantiate the DFF
  initial begin
  clk=0; di=1'b0; #35 $stop;
  int results[50];
  for (int i=0; i<50; i++) begin
    di=~di; #5;
    results[i] = {clk, di, do};  // Store the D, I, and Q values
  end
  end
  always #3 clk=~clk; // Generate clock
  initial $display ("%m: Top-level testbench module"); // Display testbench name
  initial $monitor($time," clk=%b, di=%b, do=%b",clk,di,do);
endmodule
```
This will allow you to store the clock, input and output signals at every time step for inspection. This is useful for debugging and verification purposes. 

**Note**: This will store 50 samples of the D, I, and Q values in the results array. You can change this to any number of samples as your project requires. Also, the array should be large enough to avoid overflow. 

The initial block is replaced with a for loop, that iterates 50 times. Inside the loop, the input is toggled, and then the array element is assigned the values of the current state of the D, I, and Q (respectively) at that time step. The #5 delay ensures that the input toggles every 5 time units.
The $display and $monitor statements are not changed, as they are not used in this variation. If you wish to see those, you could delete the $display and uncomment the $monitor lines. 

This code will not only run and generate a waveform file (.vcd), it will also store each cycle's D, I, and Q values in the results array. Please note that this requires significant storage space.

**Warning:** This approach can consume a large amount of memory if the number of samples is very large. It is typically used for debugging and verification purposes. If you're working on a production system
