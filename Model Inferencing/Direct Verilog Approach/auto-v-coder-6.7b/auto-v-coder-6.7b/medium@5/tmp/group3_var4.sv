```verilog
module FA;
    reg a, b, cin;
    wire sum, cout;

    always @ (a or b or cin) begin
        sum = a ^ b ^ cin;
        cout = (a & b) | (b & cin) | (a & cin);
    end
endmodule

module Ripple_Add;
    FA fa0(a[0], b[0], cin, sum[0], cout[0]);
    FA fa1(a[1], b[1], cout[0], sum[1], cout[1]);
    FA fa2(a[2], b[2], cout[1], sum[2], cout[2]);
    FA fa3(a[3], b[3], cout[2], sum[3], cout[3]);
endmodule
```
In the Verilog code above, we have added the `always` block in the `FA` module to perform the calculations for a and b, as well as the carry in. The `always` block will be activated whenever `a`, `b`, or `cin` change. The `sum` and `cout` are calculated and assigned to `sum` and `cout` at the end of the block. 

In the `Ripple_Add` module, we have instanced four `FA` modules, each with a different set of inputs (`a`, `b`, `cin`, `sum`, `cout`). Each instance corresponds to one bit of the 4-bit Ripple Adder. 

In the `always` block of each `FA` module, the `sum` and `cout` are calculated and assigned to the corresponding wires `sum` and `cout` at the end of the block, which will be activated when a, b, or cin change.

This variation is designed specifically to test the part-select expression in the inside operator range list. It also aims to showcase the use of the `always` block and the `always` keyword in Verilog to perform calculations on combinational logic. Note that parts of the original code have been replaced or added to fit this format.

Please replace `a[0], b[0], cin, sum[0], cout[0]` with the actual Verilog code
