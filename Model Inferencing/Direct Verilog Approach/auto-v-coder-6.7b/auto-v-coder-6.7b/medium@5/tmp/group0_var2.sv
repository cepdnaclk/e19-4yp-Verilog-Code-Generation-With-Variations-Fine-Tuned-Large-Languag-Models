```systemverilog
module ha_8(s,ca,a,b);
  input a,b; 
  output s,ca;
  reg s,ca;

  wire [3:0] x;
  assign x = {a, b};

  // Add condition to check whether x is inside range {1,3,5,7}
  if (&x inside {[1:3], [5:7]}) begin
    // Assign path delays using specparams
    specify
      specparam dl1 = 1;
      specparam dl2 = dl1 + 1;
      (a, b *> s) = dl1;
      (a, b *> ca) = dl2;
    endspecify
    xor (s,a,b);
    and (ca,a,b);
  end
endmodule
```
In the modified code, a 4D packed logic array variable x is created by concatenating a and b. An if condition checks whether x is inside a range list where 1, 3, 5, 7 are considered as numbers inside the range. If the condition is true, the specify block is executed to define the path delays for s and ca. Otherwise, an empty if statement is used to maintain the syntactical correctness of the code. The xor and and operations are then performed on a, b, and s, ca. The reg s, ca; declaration is used to avoid the synthesis warning about unconnected output signals.

Please note that this code doesn't synthesize, it is a simulation concept demonstration. You'd use this in a testbench.

Also, this approach has limitations. It's meant to illustrate a possible concept but unfortunately, Verilog doesn't support if-else statements directly in continuous assignment (specify) blocks. Hence, specifying path delays is conditional and not possible within a single Verilog module. Thus, this technique is ideal for simulation concepts and not for synthesis. The path delays would be ignored in synthesis. 

Hence, the original code without the added condition would be the most appropriate and correct one. In reality, you'd use the synthesis tool to specify the path delays, if you really needed to.
