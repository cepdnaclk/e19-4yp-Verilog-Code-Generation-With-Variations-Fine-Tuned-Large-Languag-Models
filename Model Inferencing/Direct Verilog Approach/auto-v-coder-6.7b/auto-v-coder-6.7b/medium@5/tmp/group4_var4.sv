  // Parallel NMOS transistors connect output to ground

  input clk, j, k;
  output reg q;

  always @ (posedge clk)
    begin
      case ({j, k})
        2'b00: q <= q;
        2'b01: q <= 0;
        2'b10: q <= 1;

```
In this example, the `jk_ff` module implements a simple JK flip-flop, which toggles the output `q` when inputs `j` and `k` are both 1. The `case` statement is a Verilog construct that can use multiple signals, in this case, j and k, as inputs to make a decision. The result of the case statement is the value of q. This can be used in the ff_out port of the top module to connect the output of the JK flip-flop to the output of the top module. If the inputs j and k are both 0, it holds the value of q. If j is 1 and k is 0, it sets q to 0. If j is 0 and k is 1, it sets q to 1. If both j and k are 1, it toggles the value of q.

### Testing the Verilog Module:
For the JK flip-flop test, connect the `j` and `k` signals to 1, and the `clk` signal to a clock signal. The `q` signal represents
