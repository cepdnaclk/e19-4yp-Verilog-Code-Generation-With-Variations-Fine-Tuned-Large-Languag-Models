In the modified code, the JK Flip Flop is now included as a module. A module called "JK_Flip_Flop" is declared which contains a 2-to-1 multiplexer which takes in the values of J and K and produces the corresponding output. This is done using a case statement inside an always block. This allows the value of "Q" to be updated on the rising edge of the clock signal "CLK".

The case statement in the JK Flip Flop module has been altered to use inside with function call result in the index. This changes the logic of the JK Flip Flop to be a D type flip flop with J and K as the control signals. Note that the inside with function call result in the index was not available in Quartus II prior to 13.0 SP1, so this code might not work in earlier versions of the software.

The JK Flip Flop is connected to the nor3NMOS module as an input. This is not shown in the code snippet above as it is assumed that the connection to the input of nor3NMOS
