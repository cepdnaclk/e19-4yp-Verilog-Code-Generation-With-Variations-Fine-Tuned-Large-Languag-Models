In this code, instead of adding or subtracting numbers, it performs bitwise AND, OR and XOR operations on the least significant bit (LSB) of the two numbers provided. The rest of the number is left intact. This is primarily for illustration purposes, as bitwise operations on arrays are generally not recommended in hardware design. If you need to perform arithmetic operations on arrays, use an ALU for each element separately.
