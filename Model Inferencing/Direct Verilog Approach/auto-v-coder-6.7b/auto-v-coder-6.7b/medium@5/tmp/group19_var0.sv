```verilog
module counter (
    input wire clk, rst,
    output reg [3:0] count
);
always @(posedge clk or posedge rst) begin
    if (rst) count <= 4'b0000;
    else count <= count + 1;
end

wire [3:0] slice_count = count[3:0]; //slice the 4 bit count into 4 bit slice_count

initial begin
    #10ns; //wait for 10ns (or any amount you want to test)
    $display("slice_count: %b", slice_count); //print the sliced value 
end
endmodule
```
In this variation, we add a wire array of four bits: `slice_count`. This wire is assigned the sliced value of the `count` register, which means every bit of `count` is now accessible by `slice_count`. The initial block is used to wait for a certain amount of time and then print out the value of `slice_count`. This will allow you to see the sliced output during simulation. The slicing operation doesn't change the logic of the counter, it's just providing another way to observe the internal status of the counter. 

You can replace the `#10ns` with any time you want to wait before displaying the count, and adjust the $display line to suit your debugging needs.### Testing:
To test this code, you would need a Verilog simulator such as ModelSim, or a hardware simulator such as VCS, and you could run the simulation in the simulator GUI to observe the output. 

Make sure the simulation starts with reset signal asserted to check the initial state of the counter. Then, allow the clock signal to progress to check if the counter is counting up correctly. At the end of the simulation, you should see `slice_count:` followed by the value of `count`. 

Remember to use `$finish;` to stop the simulation at the end of the test. This is done in the `$finish;` line in the initial block of the code to ensure the simulation stops and does not continue indefinitely. 

This test is only for verifying the behaviour of the counter module. It's not
