```verilog
module aoibeh2(o,a,b); // Mixed structural/behavioral AOI
output o;
input [1:0] a,b;
wire a1,b1; // Outputs of AND gates
reg o; // Behavioral output must be reg
// Structural AND gates using primitives
and g1(a1,a[1],a[0]), g2(b1,b[1],b[0]);
// Behavioral NOR logic sensitive to AND outputs
always@(a1 or b1)
o = ~(a1 || b1);

initial begin // Add initial block
o = ~(a1 || b1);
$display("Output is %d",o);
end
endmodule
```
In the code above, an initial block is added at the end of the module definition. Inside the block, procedural continuous assign is used to assign the output with the value of the negation of the OR of the AND outputs. It will simulate the same functionality without needing an always block. Also, $display is used to print the output value. 

This modification of the base code adds functionality to print out the output of the module's logic during simulation. Note that $display is a procedural continuous assign statement that prints a formatted string to the standard output. In this case, it prints the output value at the end of the simulation. 

This code will still function the same as the original code snippet. It's just more convenient to have a procedural continuous assign at the end for debugging and simulation purposes. ### Disclaimer:
Always remember to use $display, $monitor, $strobe, $system, and other similar procedural continuous statements at the appropriate places in your code. They are primarily used for simulation debugging and can be seen as an alternative to using a hardware waveform viewer in simulation. The use of these statements should be balanced with the other Verilog constructs, and should primarily be used for simulation and debugging purposes, not for actual hardware implementation. In general, using these statements in non-debugging simulations or synthesis will not impact the correctness or performance of the final device. If the code is to be synthesized, these statements should not be included.manysimulation-tools-and-debuggers-
