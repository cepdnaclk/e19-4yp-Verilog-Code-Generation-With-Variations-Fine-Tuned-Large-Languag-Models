```verilog

module tst_CMOSsw1();
  reg in,con; wire out;
  CMOSsw1 cmsw(out,in,con); // Instantiate CMOS switch
  initial begin in=1'b0; con=1'b1; end // Start enabled
  always #5 in =~in; // Toggle data
  always #3 con=~con; // Toggle control

  // Testing Variation
  reg [3:0] arr [0:3] = '{1,2,3,4};
  always @(*) begin
    if (out == arr[0:2]) begin
      $display("Test passed: Output matches array slice range.");
    end else begin
      $display("Test failed: Output does not match array slice range.");

```
Note: For simplicity, I used a simple comparison between output and a specific slice range of an array. In a real-world scenario, you would need to do more complex assertions or calculations. `initially` block is equivalent to `always` block that triggers at the beginning of the simulation. `begin` and `end` are keywords to start and end a block, respectively. This is usually used to combine multiple statements together.

The line `CMOSsw1 cmsw(out,in,con);` includes the implementation of the CMOS switch.

The line `initial begin in=1'b0; con=1'b1; end` initializes the input signal `in` to 0 and control signal `con` to 1.

The lines `always #5 in =~in;` and `always #3 con=~con;` toggle the input and control signals every 5 and 3 time units respectively.

`$monitor($time, "in = %b, con = %b, output = %b ",in,con,out);` prints the values of `in`, `con` and `out`
