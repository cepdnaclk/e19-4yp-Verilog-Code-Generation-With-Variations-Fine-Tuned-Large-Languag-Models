This code will change the j and k inputs of the jk flip flop using a case statement, depending on the result of the inside function call. The inside function returns the index of the highest value input that is active.

Please note that the case statement above is just a placeholder and will need to be replaced with the appropriate value or logic based on the design requirement. Also, ensure that all the indexes used in the case statement match with your intended indexes.

Remember that the inside function in SystemVerilog is not supported in standard Verilog. The inside function is a SystemVerilog feature that is supposed to work only with the SystemVerilog compiler. The above code will give compile-time errors in standard Verilog.###

For the above code to work properly, it should be compiled with the -novopt option in place. This option disables optimization and makes it easier to see the effect of the inside function. It is recommended to run the simulation to observe the behavior in action.

Also, keep in mind that this is just the base code, you might need to modify it based on the actual design requirements. Be sure to understand the logic behind the design properly and apply it accordingly. 

Remember to check the index used in the case statement with your actual requirement.###

Also, make sure you have the necessary simulation and synthesis tools available for running the
