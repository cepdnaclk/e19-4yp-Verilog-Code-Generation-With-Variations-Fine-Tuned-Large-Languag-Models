```verilog
module example7_4(D, Clock, Q1, Q2);
input D, Clock;
output reg Q1, Q2;
reg [7:0] packedArray[3:0];
integer index = 2;
always @(posedge Clock)
begin
    Q1 <= D;
    Q2 <= Q1;
    while (index < 4) begin
        packedArray[index] = packedArray[index - 1];
        index = index + 1;
    end
end
endmodule
```
In the modified code, we add a packed array `packedArray[3:0]` and a variable index. The while loop inside the always block applies the variable index to update the elements of the array. This variation demonstrates the use of a while loop with indexing applied to a packed array. It is a simple way to demonstrate the concept of array indexing and while loop in Verilog, but keep in mind that the logic may need to be adjusted depending on the specific problem or application.### 

Please remember to add synthesizable test bench and verify the behavior of the module.###

Also, keep in mind that working with arrays may increase the size of the logic, so it's good to consider if the synthesized design meets the requirements for speed and area.

Lastly, always take into consideration the design methodology and constraints when working with synthesizable logic. This modified example is illustrative and not recommended for actual use in a design.```verilog
module example7_4_testbench();
reg D, Clock;
wire Q1, Q2;

example7_4 dut(D, Clock, Q1, Q2);

initial
begin
    Clock = 1'b0;
    D = 1'b0;

    // Drive the clock
    forever #5 Clock = ~Clock;
end

initial

    D = 1'b0;
    #10 D = 1'b1;
    #10;
    #10 D = 1'b0;
    #10;
    #10 D = 1'b1;
    #100;  // Wait a bit longer to verify the flip
