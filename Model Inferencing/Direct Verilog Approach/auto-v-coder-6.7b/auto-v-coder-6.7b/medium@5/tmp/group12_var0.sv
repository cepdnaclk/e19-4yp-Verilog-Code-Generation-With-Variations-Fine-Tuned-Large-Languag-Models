```verilog
module maj3 (a, b, c, y);
input a, b, c;
output y;
wire [2:0] im;
always @(*) begin
  im = {a, b, c};
  y = (im[2:0] == 7'b011) || (im[2:0] == 7'b101) || (im[2:0] == 7'b110);
end
endmodule
```
In this code:
- The 'im' wire is used to hold the values of a, b, and c.
- This is an always block, which means that the block of code inside it will be continuously evaluated, irrespective of the input values.
- The input values of a, b, and c, are packaged into 'im' using the concatenation operator ({...}).
- The value of 'y' is set according to the truth table of the majority function.
- The '===' operator will be used to compare the packed vector 'im' with the constant range 7'b011 (value 3), 7'b101 (value 5), 7'b110 (value 6).
- If any of them satisfy the condition, the output will be 1, otherwise 0. The '||' operator signifies 'or' in Verilog.

Please note that this Verilog code doesn't behave exactly like the code you provided with the 'or' operator using intermediate and gate outputs. As 'im' is the packed array of {a, b, c}, it doesn't have 'intermediate' values as the original code does. Also, the 'and' gate output doesn't make sense in this context, given you're looking for a majority function. However, the logic of majority function is implemented in the 'y' output.

Also, always blocks are evaluated when any input change is detected. They are evaluated at the same time they are first encountered in the design. They do not have an inherent delay. The '@(*)' notation is used to specify that the synthesizer should attempt to optimize the implementation of the block of code as much as possible. 

Please make sure to run the synthesized design by using appropriate tools and methodologies.
