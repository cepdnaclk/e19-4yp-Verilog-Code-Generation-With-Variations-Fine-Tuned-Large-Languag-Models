```verilog
module aoi2(g,a,b,c,d);
output g;
input a,b,c,d;
wire [2:0] e,f,g1; // Intermediate signals
// Dataflow assignments for AND, OR, and NOT operations
assign e = {a && b, c && d, a && c};
assign g1 = {e[0] || e[1], e[2]};
assign g = ~g1[0]; // Final AOI output
endmodule
```

In this modified code, we use an array of 2 or 3 wires, `e`, and `g1`. Inside the `initial` block, we can use an inside expression with a function call within the indexing. The function call `{a && b, c && d, a && c}` returns a vector of 3-bits which are then assigned to `e`. This allows us to create and utilize more complex logic, such as the AOI operation shown in the example.### Note:
Be careful while using the intermediate signals `e` and `f`, as they do not represent physical signals. They are just used for intermediate calculations within the module. Therefore, the `g` output will be driven by the `g1` array. In this modified code, `g1` contains two bits and `g` will be driven by the first bit. This is because the first bit in `g1` is the AOI result of two input bits and the second bit in `g1` is the AOI result of two input bits. The second bit is not used in the output.

This is just a variation of AOI operation from the base code and can be modified according to the exact requirements and the number of variables in the problem. 

Please replace `{a && b, c && d, a && c}` with an appropriate expression for your specific problem set, as the original expression does not make sense in the context of real-world problems. For example, if the inputs are different, the expression should be changed accordingly. `{a && b, c && d, a && c}` is just an example that matches with the given output. 

For AOI operation (AND followed by OR),
