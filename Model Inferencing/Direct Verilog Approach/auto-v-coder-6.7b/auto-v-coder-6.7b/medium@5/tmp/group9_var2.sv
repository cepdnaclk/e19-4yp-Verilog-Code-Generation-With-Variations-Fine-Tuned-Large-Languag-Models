```verilog
module pulses; // Correct pulse generation attempt
  reg [8:0] I;
  reg a,b;
  initial
    while (I<100) begin // Loop based on integer I
      b = I[1]; // Assign bit 1 of I to b (Corrected indexing)

      // Creating a unique case for array-slice range
      case (I[7:0]) inside
        {8'h01, 8'h02, 8'h04, 8'h08, 8'h10, 8'h20, 8'h40, 8'h80}: a=1;
        default: a=0;
      endcase

      I = I + 1; // Increment I
    end
  initial I=0; // Initialize I
  initial #100 $stop; // Stop simulation
endmodule
```
In this code, we created a case statement that uses a unique case expression with an array-slice range. The case checks if the least significant bits of the array (from 0 to 7) are any of the numbers {1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128}. If they are, the value of a is set to 1, otherwise it is set to 0. This is a simplistic example but it demonstrates the usage of array-slice range with case statements.### Running the modified code:

The modified code will produce the same output but it will also count the number of 1s in the least significant bits when the value of I is between 0 and 127. For example, if the value of I is 1, then the value of a will be 1. If the value of I is 3, then the value of a will be 1 as well because 3 in binary is 11, and only the least significant bit is checked. This is a simple demonstration of how to use array-slice ranges with case statements in Verilog. 

Note: This code is for demonstration purposes only and does not represent the most efficient method of generating pulses. In practice, it would be more appropriate to utilize `always` blocks
