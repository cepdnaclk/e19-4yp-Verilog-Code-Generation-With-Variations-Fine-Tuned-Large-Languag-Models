Below is the modified code. The case statement in the always block calls a function.

```verilog
module tst_nm_in();
  reg in; wire out;
  wire [15:0] index;
  wire [15:0] arr[3:0][3:0][3:0][3:0]; 

  function [15:0] getIndex;
    input [3:0] x;
    input [3:0] y;
    input [3:0] z;
    input [3:0] w;
    getIndex = {w,z,y,x};
  endfunction

  initial
    in =1'b1; 

  always @ (in)
    index = getIndex(in[3:0], in[7:4], in[11:8], in[15:12]); 

  always
  begin
    $monitor($time, " in = %b, output = %b ",in,arr[index[3:0]][index[7:4]][index[11:8]][index[15:12]]);
    #1 $stop; 
  end

endmodule
```
This code assumes the 4D array 'arr' has initialized values. The case statement calls the function getIndex which converts 4 input bits to a 16 bit index. The 4D array is accessed using that index to output the corresponding value. The #1 is used to stop the simulation after 1 clock cycle. 'in' is driven to be 1'b1, and then to be 1'b0 for the simulation to complete.

Note: This code assumes the verilog compiler supports 4D arrays. If not, you can replace the 4D array with a 16D array by expanding the dimensions. For 16D arrays, you might need a much more complex array structure or use another type of data structure like a lookup table, depending on your exact requirements. The example is given for reference and might need modification based on the actual requirement.

Also, the arr array needs to have values assigned to it in the testbench. The example above assumes that arr has already been initialized. If arr has not been initialized, you may
