```verilog
module RAM (output[7:0] Obus, input[7:0] Ibus, input[3:0] Adr, input Clk, Read);
reg[7:0] Storage[15:0];
reg[7:0] ObusReg;
assign #1 Obus = ObusReg;
always @(posedge Clk)
begin
    if (Read==1'b0)
        Storage[Adr] <= Ibus;
    else
    begin
        while(1'b1)
        begin
            ObusReg <= Storage[Adr];
            if(Adr == 4'b1111)
                break;
            else
                Adr <= Adr + 1;
        end
    end
end
endmodule
```
In this modified code, we introduce a while loop condition inside the if-else statement. The while loop continuously updates the ObusReg with the value of Storage[Adr] until the Adr reaches a certain value(here, it is 4'b1111). Please modify this value to suit your specific needs. If the value of Adr reaches this limit, the loop is broken, and the process continues with the new Adr value. This modification helps to perform a series of read operations on the memory array Storage using Adr as an index and outputs the value obtained. This variation is mainly to showcase array-slice operations and the use of while loop with varying conditions inside a module. 

Please note that this approach may not be ideal for synthesis or hardware realization as it introduces clock delay and might not be able to synthesize due to a synthesis limitation. The recommended approach to RAM in actual hardware design is to use single clock or multi-clock flip-flops. This approach is shown here purely for educational reasons. 

Also, consider that the while loop is designed to be an infinite loop, and if the value of Adr exceeds the range of 15 (4'b1111), the value may be unexpectedly assigned to ObusReg, as there's no mechanism to return the value of storage by changing Adr back to a valid range. This issue may depend on your specific use case. It's generally recommended to use a more appropriate mechanism for reading from the Storage array.

Please adapt this code according to your
