        0: f = values[0] & values[1];
        1: f = values[1] & values[2];

In this modified code, we've added an array `values` to hold the inputs `x1`, `x2`, and `x3`. Then, we use the `$random % 3` function to determine the index of the `values` array to select the operation to perform. This allows for a dynamic control signal to determine at runtime which logic gate to use.

The f function outputs are now generated inside a `case` statement to select from three different logic operations based on the results of `$random % 3`. The g function simply performs the same operation with the third input.

Please note that the variable `x3` is not used in the original code. It has been added to complete the array `values`. This is why `x3` was missing during the example provided. However, this code assumes that `x3` is always available as an input. If `x3` is not necessary, you can remove its declaration and assignment.

The use of `$random % 3` allows for dynamic selection of the operations. The `$random` function generates a random number, and `% 3` is a modulus operator that keeps the remainder of the division by 3. This means that `$random % 3` will always generate a number between 0 and 2, which corresponds to the three possible operations. 

This modification allows for a dynamic behavior change at runtime based on some external control signal, which is a powerful feature and can improve the versatility and flexibility of the design.
