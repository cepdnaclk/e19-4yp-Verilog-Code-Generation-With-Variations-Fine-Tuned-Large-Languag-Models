The MDA here will be a constant for simplicity. However, in actual implementation, you would typically have an MDA in a register or another memory element, in which case the priority case would be implemented appropriately.

```verilog
module gates4_top (
input wire [3:0] sw,
output wire [2:0] ld
);

integer i;
wire [2:0] temp;

gates4 U1
(
.x(sw),
.and4_(temp[2]),
.or4_(temp[1]),
.xor4_(temp[0])
);

always_comb begin
  for(i = 2; i >= 0; i = i - 1) begin
    if(temp[i] == 1'b1) begin
      ld = i; 
      break;
    end
  end
end
endmodule
```
This modified code will select the most significant bit from the 4-bit output of the gates4 module, assuming a 1 on that bit will be the most significant output. The `ld` output will then be the index of this bit. This code makes use of a priority case within a combinational always block to make sure the selection is done at the time of synthesis.

Note: The use of a priority case here is merely a simplification. To avoid the combinational loop between the synthesis tool and the synthesis logic, implement the priority case using an intermediate flip-flop and a sequential always block that changes the state of the flip-flop when the input changes. However, this approach might be more complex and error-prone. You should consider carefully the need for such solution based on the specifics of your project. 

Note: For a more realistic use-case, consider using a higher-level language or compiler with better synthesis support, or use a synthesis tool that supports Verilog HDL, like Synopsys Design Compiler and EDA Playground. These tools can synthesize the design and generate optimized, error-free, and efficient RTL (Register Transfer Level) for the target device. ### Base Verilog Code:

The code provided above is a basic example of how to implement a priority selection mechanism in Verilog. In a real-world project, the MDA (Mixed Data Array) used to select
