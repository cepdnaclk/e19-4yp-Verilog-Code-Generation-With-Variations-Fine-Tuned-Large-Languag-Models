```verilog
module example7_5(D, Clock, Q1);
input D, Clock;
output Q1;
reg [3:0] Q1;
integer i = 0;
always @(posedge Clock)
begin
    Q1[i] <= D;
    i <= i + 1;
    if (i == 4) i <= 0;
end
endmodule
```

In this example, the output Q1 is a packed array of 4 bits with index manipulation using a while loop condition. The index i is increased on every positive edge of the clock to move through the array. Then, if the index i equals to 4, it is reset to 0. This ensures that the array is cyclic and it's not necessary to use a separate flip-flop for Q2 in the original code.
Note: The use of packed array for Q1 is to demonstrate array usage. In a real scenario, it's better to use a register array or an array of individual registers, based on the context of the problem.

Make sure to add appropriate signal declarations and port connections in your testbench.

Also note that Verilog doesn't support a built-in mechanism for an array of flip-flops. The above code is a simplified example to illustrate how to implement a cyclic bit manipulation using Verilog. You may need to use multiple flip-flops or registers to implement a real-world application.
