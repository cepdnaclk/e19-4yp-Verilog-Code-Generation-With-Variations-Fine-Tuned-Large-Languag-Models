```Verilog

input wire [3:0] a,
input wire [3:0] b,
input wire s,
output reg [3:0] y

if(s == 0)
y = a;

y = b[{s, 1}]; // XMR-style index expression for 2D array

This variation will allow the multiplexer to select a single bit from a signal 'b'. The MSB of signal 'b' will be selected if's' is 1, and the LSB if's' is 0. 

Please note that this variation is only applicable when the 'b' signal is a single 4-bit signal, and not a 2x2 array as in the original example. The syntax "{s, 1}" is used as the index in this case, which means "select the second element of the signal b". In case it is a 2-D array signal, the indexing can take more complex arrangements.

This variation can be useful in systems which require low level control of signal selection. This code, however, assumes that 'b' is a single 4-bit signal with 2-bit index as opposed to a 2-D array. For 2-D array, more complex indexing is needed.

Also, the output 'y' will be a 4-bit wide signal, which may not make sense for the's' input. If we only want to select a single bit from 'b', we might want to change 'y' to a single bit (wire), and index 'b' appropriately.

For a 2-D array input 'b', we might write it as 'b[x][y]' and 'y' can be selected on's'. However, this will require more advanced signal manipulation, and might not be as efficient for use in actual designs, especially if the 2-D array is of size 1x2, as this is a relatively simple multiplexer. 

For larger 2-D array signals, a more efficient approach would be to use Verilog's vector slicing feature to select the appropriate bit from the array. However, this may not be appropriate if 'b
