```verilog
module nil;
reg [2:0] a;

initial
begin
a = 3'b001;
$display ("t=%0t display: a = %b", $time, a); // Added time
end

always @(*)
begin
    $display("t=%0t a[0] = %b", $time, a[0]);  // Added time
end

initial
$monitor("t=%0t monitor: a = %b", $time, a);

endmodule
```
This variation will output the value of `a[0]` in an always block that is triggered at each change of any input. The $display statement is used to monitor the time, and the value of 'a[0]' as well. The initial $monitor statement which is triggered at t=0 will output the value of 'a' at t=0.
Please remember to change initial values for `a` as per your module requirement.### Variation Explanation:
The base verilog code was modified to use an array, and to include a $monitor statement that triggers at every time-unit, and a $display statement that logs the value of 'a[0]' at each trigger. This will allow you to observe how 'a[0]' changes with respect to the inputs in your module.
### Variation Instruction:
For future reference, the $monitor statement is a tool for debugging Verilog. It monitors the values of signals and can be used to monitor changes in a signal over time. The values can be viewed via the standard console or a log file.

The $display statement is used to print the results of a simulation using Verilog format strings. It can be used to print debugging information or simulation results to the console.

The $time statement is used to get the current simulation time. This statement is used to print the current time in the console.

Remember to replace 'a' in place of 'a[0]' with the name of your array and its elements.### Execution Instruction:
To execute this code, you can use a Verilog simulator such as Icarus Verilog, Modelsim, or Synopsys Design Compiler. Once the simulator is installed and set up, you can compile the code using a command like
