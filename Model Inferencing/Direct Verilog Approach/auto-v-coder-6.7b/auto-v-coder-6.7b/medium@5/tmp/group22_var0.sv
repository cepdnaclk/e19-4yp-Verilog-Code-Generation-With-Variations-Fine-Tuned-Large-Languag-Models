```Verilog
module nil;
reg [3:0] a, b, c;
initial
begin
a = 4'b0000;
b = 4'b0000;
c = 4'b0000;
$display ("t=%0t display: a = %b, b = %b, c = %b", $time, a, b, c);
end
always@(posedge a[1] and posedge b[1])
begin
c[1] <= 1'b1;
$display ("t=%0t monitor: c = %b", $time, c);
end
endmodule
```
In this variation, the part-select `a[1]` is used in a conditional expression within an always block. It will trigger the `c[1]` output to "1" whenever the `a[1]` input changes from a "0" to a "1", and the `b[1]` input changes from a "0" to a "1" concurrently. This is similar to an "OR" gate with an output pin.
The `$monitor` statement is also removed due to the removal of the `$monitor` statement, the Verilog simulator will not display any output messages. Instead, the `$display` statements will be used to print out the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` at specific time points.

Note: Ensure to set the `a` and `b` inputs to something other than "0000" to see the changes reflected in the output. In this case, you can set `a` and `b` to "1000" and "1000" respectively to see the changes of `c`. Also, ensure that there is a clock on your design to drive these changes. If there is no clock, you can use `#10` in your `always` block to simulate a clock tick, and change the `a` and `b` inputs within a `forever` block to see how the `c` changes.

This code also uses an array `a` and `b` and selects one bit using part-select to check the condition. It will only check the value of `a[1]` and `b[1]
