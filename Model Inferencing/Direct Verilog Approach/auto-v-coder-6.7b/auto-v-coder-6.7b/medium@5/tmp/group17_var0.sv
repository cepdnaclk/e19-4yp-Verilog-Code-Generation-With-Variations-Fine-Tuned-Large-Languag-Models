```verilog
module mux41b (
input wire [3:0] c,
input wire [1:0] s,
output wire z
);
wire [1:0] temp = 'd0;
always @(*) begin
 case (s)
  2'b00: temp = c[0];
  2'b01: temp = c[1];
  2'b10: temp = c[2];
  2'b11: temp = c[3];
  default: temp = 'd0;
 endcase
end
assign z = temp;
endmodule
```
In this modified code, the case statement is used to select the corresponding bit of the control array 'c' according to the current value of the select signal's'. The value of the selected bit is assigned to the output 'z'. The output 'z' is a wire type variable which is always assigned to the value of 'temp'. The 'temp' variable is used to hold the value of the selected bit from the control array according to the current value of the select signal's'. This is done to avoid a single-bit assignments in Verilog that are not synthesizable. If 'temp' is not assigned, the synthesis tool will issue a warning about the unassigned variable.

In case of a dynamic variable index, the case statement can be used directly without any variable to hold the value of the selected bit. This is because in Verilog, the case statement can operate directly on expressions. 

Do note that this code will not work in a real device, as synthesizers may not accept case statements with combinational logic in a real device. However, it is a simulation model you can use to understand the concept of multiplexers in Verilog. ### Additional Note: Always use 'default' case for the last case in the case statement. If you don't use default, then when any other value of's' is received, the output 'z' will be unpredictable or will show an x. This is not a good practice as it may lead to unexpected errors in real-world scenarios. 

Also, the above code can be synthesized in the synthesis tools like Quartus, Synplify Pro etc. They can correctly understand the logic flow and generate a suitable hardware architecture from it. But please note
