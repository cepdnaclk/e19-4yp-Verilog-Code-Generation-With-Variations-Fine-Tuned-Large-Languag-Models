In this modification, a wire array `arr` is declared with the format `[2:0]` to represent a three-bit packed array. It is filled with `a1`, `a2`, `b1` respectively.
Then, a case statement is used to give custom logic based on the packed array value. In this case, whenever the value is `011` or `110` or `111` the output `o` will be assigned `1` otherwise it will be assigned `0`. This represents a logical `AND` operation using the 3-input AOI gate.
This change makes the logic different from the original code and gives you more control over the output based on the input values. It uses the XMR-based hierarchical index method to access the elements of the array. 

Please note that this is a simple example and does not represent a very common usage scenario in a real design. In a real design, the value of `o` can be determined in various ways or the case statement can be replaced with more complex logic or a lookup table. 

Also, the case statement may not yield the desired output if the `arr` array is not properly updated after synthesis and implementation
