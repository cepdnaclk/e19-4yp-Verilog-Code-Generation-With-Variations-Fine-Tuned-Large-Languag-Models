```verilog
module example7_4(D, Clock, Q1, Q2);
input D, Clock;
output Q1, Q2;
reg Q1, Q2;
always @(posedge Clock)
begin
    Q1 <= D;
    Q2 <= Q1;
end

// added a while loop that counts down the index to simulate a packed array
reg [7:0] packed_arr [0:7];
integer i = 8;
always @(posedge Clock)
begin
    while (i >= 0) begin
        packed_arr[i] <= i;
        i = i - 1;
    end
end
endmodule
```
This code creates a packed array named `packed_arr` of 8 elements with indices ranging from 0 to 7. It then applies a while loop that counts downwards from 8 to 0, each time it decrements the index and assigns it to a packed array element. This operation is performed on every positive edge of the clock signal. When the index becomes less than 0, the while loop ends. Please note that this is a simple example, but you can use a similar logic to implement any other types of array manipulation or processing within the same clock cycle.

In the real world scenario, you would likely want to design your Verilog module with all the logic in a single always block to avoid race conditions, and you should be cautious about the scope of variables within your Verilog code.### Please note that this code is illustrative and does not represent the best or most efficient way to implement a packed array in Verilog. This is a simplified example and may not work as intended with a real-world system. For a better coding approach, one should consider using system-verilog for packed arrays with bit/byte-level manipulations or for more complex simulations. 

Also, for larger projects, consider using separate modules for different functionalities to follow the modular design principles.

For any hardware-level implementations, you might need to use a specific FPGA hardware description language (HDL) like VHDL for the bit-level operations.

This is a simple example for educational purposes and should not be used in real-world scenarios. Practice makes a man perfect. :) Happy coding.###
