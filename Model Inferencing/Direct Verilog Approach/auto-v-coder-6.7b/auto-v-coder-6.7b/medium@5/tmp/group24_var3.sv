```verilog
module tst_dff_p_b();
  reg di,clk; wire [2:0] do;
  dff_p d1(do,di,clk); // Instantiate the DFF
  initial begin clk=0; di=1'b0; #35 $stop; end // Initialize & stop
  always #3 clk=~clk; // Generate clock
  always #5 di=~di; // Toggle data
  initial $display ("%m: Top-level testbench module"); // Display testbench name
  initial $monitor($time," clk=%b, di=%b, do=%b",clk,di,do);
endmodule
```
In this modified code, the `dff_p` module is designed to return an array of 3 bits (`[2:0]`) on the `do` output. This change facilitates the testbench to check and display the result by accessing each bit in the array individually. The array assignment can also serve to observe the 'do' output of the DFF module on the 3 different clock cycles. Please note that the DFF-to-Testbench connection is defined in a standard way, as the DFF-to-Testbench interface is defined as `[2:0]`, which can be used in the testbench as well. Adding a procedural block to monitor results is also allowed inside the initial block. The procedural block `$monitor` is designed to print out the current simulation time, along with the clk, di, and do signals. This block will execute continuously in the simulation, printing the current simulation time, the current value of `clk`, `di`, and `do` signals. This is useful for monitoring the simulation and debugging purposes.

Please make sure that the testbench is synthesizable and that it is connected correctly to the DFF module. If the DFF module does not return an array of 3 bits, you will need to modify the testbench and the interface accordingly. 

The use of array index assignment is not a direct modification of the original code but a way to visualize the output of the DFF module better. The original `di`,`do` variable is replaced with an array of 3 bits `[2:
