```verilog
module reg4(D, Clock, Resetn, Q);
input [3:0] D;
input Clock, Resetn;
output [3:0] Q;
reg [3:0] Q;
reg [3:0] D_array[3:0];
assign Q = D_array[D];

always @(posedge Clock or negedge Resetn)
    if (Resetn == 0) begin
        for(int i=0; i<4; i++) begin
            D_array[i] <= 0;
        end
        Q <= 0;
    end
    else begin
        for(int i=0; i<4; i++) begin
            D_array[i] <= D;
        end
        Q <= D;
    end
endmodule
```
In this modified code, a procedural continuous assignment is used to select a D_array value based on the input D. The D_array is initialized to 0 when resetn is 0. When resetn is 1, the D_array is updated with the value of the input D. The output Q is updated with the same value of the input D. 

Remember that in Verilog, procedural continuous assignment is not a good practice, it is recommended to use procedural continuous assignments only as a last resort. Instead, use combinational logic design where possible.### This code is an example of how to modify the base Verilog code to include dynamic selection of D_array's value based on the input D.### However, keep in mind that in Verilog, when you're dealing with arrays or dynamic behavior, it's generally not recommended to use procedural continuous assign (assign) statements. 

Procedural continuous assignments are mostly used when you need to assign an output to a specific value or when you need to create a delay between your input and output. As a general rule, it's better to keep procedural continuous assignments to a minimum and instead use combinational logic when possible. If needed, you can use assign statements in Verilog to create combinational logic.

Consider using a structural approach to the module design instead of using procedural continuous assignments. This approach will make the Verilog code more maintainable and scalable.
