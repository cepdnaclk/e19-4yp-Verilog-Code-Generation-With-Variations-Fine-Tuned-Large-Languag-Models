```Verilog
module example5(x1, x2, x3, f);
input x1, x2, x3;
output f;
reg f;
wire [7:0] test_reg = {x1, x2, x3, 1'b0, 1'b0, 1'b0, 1'b0, 1'b0};
always @(test_reg)
    if ((test_reg[7:5] == 3'b100) || (test_reg[7:5] == 3'b000) || (test_reg[7:5] == 3'b111))
        f = 1;
    else
        f = 0;
endmodule
```
In the above code, we have added an if-else block to test if part-select of the packed array 'test_reg' ranges from 3'b100 to 3'b111 or from 3'b000 to 3'b011. The output 'f' will be 1 if the condition is satisfied and 0 otherwise.

Please note, this code creates a packed array test_reg, which contains bits from x1, x2, and x3. Then part-select test_reg[7:5] is used to test the range of values. If the part-select equals either of the above conditions, the value of 'f' is set to 1. Otherwise, it is set to 0. This results in a logic function which behaves as a multiplexer with the condition on the select pins. 

This modification demonstrates how Verilog's logic building blocks can be used to create a variety of design structures. In this case, it illustrates how to test the values of an array and create a combinational logic based on those values. 

Please replace the values in the (), {}, and == with what you need to match your application. This code may also need to adapt to specific Verilog simulator or synthesis tools.

Please also note that this code may not work as expected if you are using a different value for x1, x2, and x3. The provided code is an example and may not work with different inputs or different value ranges. For example, this code specifically checks a specific
