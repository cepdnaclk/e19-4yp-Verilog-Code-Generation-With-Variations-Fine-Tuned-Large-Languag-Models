  reg [63:0] in_in, con_in, out_out;
  CMOSsw1 cmsw(out_out,in_in,con_in); // Instantiate CMOS switch
  initial begin in=1'b0; con=1'b1; end // Start enabled
  always #5 in =~in; // Toggle data

Adding array to the input and output signals in the `CMOSsw1` instantiation can help to see them in the time-line of simulation output. In this, the simulation will be displayed in the time-line format and you can see the actual values of the input and output signals at every instant of time. And the tst_CMOSsw1 test bench also changes to match the change in the `CMOSsw1` instantiation.

Note: In Verilog, you can't directly connect signals from one module to another. You need to use array/port connections for Verilog modules to communicate information. That's why we used the array type of connections.###

Also, please make sure to replace `CMOSsw1` with your actual module name in the instantiation. If you are using the `CMOSsw1` module, make sure to add it to your project files.

You can run this code under a simulation tool like ModelSim, Icarus Verilog, or GHDL. These tools can simulate Verilog RTL modules and display the simulation results. As it is, this code will not synthesize or implement any Verilog code. It is a Verilog simulation test bench code.### Practice:
For additional practice and understanding, you can write a counter module, and test it with the test bench provided above. The counter increments on every positive clock edge when its enable input is asserted. The counter's current count value can be read from the counter's output.
