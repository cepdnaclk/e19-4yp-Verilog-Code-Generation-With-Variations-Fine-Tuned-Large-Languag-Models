```verilog
module FA;
    reg a, b, cin;
    wire sum, cout;

    assign sum = a ^ b ^ cin;
    assign cout = (a & b) | (b & cin) | (a & cin);
endmodule

module Ripple_Add;
    FA fa[3:0]();
    reg [3:0] a, b;
    wire [3:0] sum;

    assign sum = a + b;
endmodule
```
In the modified code, we define four `FA` modules, each having three ports: `a`, `b`, `cin`. These are connected in a way to form a 4-bit ripple-carry adder.
The four `FA` instances are instantiated in `Ripple_Add` module, and a four bit input is connected to `a` and `b` which are added in the always block. The output `sum` is then declared and linked with the input of the `Ripple_Add` module.

Note: In the above code, the `FA` module is a Full Adder module and it performs an addition operation between two bits. It has three inputs: `a`, `b`, and `cin` (carry in) and two outputs: `sum` and `cout` (carry out). `a` and `b` are inputs and `cin` is the carry-in. `cout` is the carry-out bit that is sent to the next Full Adder. The `sum` is the sum of the `a` and `b` bits.

The ripple adder, on the other hand, connects all the Full Adders together in a way that allows them to work together to perform an addition operation. This is done by instantiating the `FA` module in an array. This array is indexed from 0 to 3, which means that you have 4 Full Adders.

This example also includes use of a part-select expression in the inside operator range list. It should be noted that the sum of the `Ripple_Add` module is actually a sum of each Full Adder modules. Each Full Adder `a` bit, `b` bit, and `cin` is connected to a sum of bits in a specific Full Ad
