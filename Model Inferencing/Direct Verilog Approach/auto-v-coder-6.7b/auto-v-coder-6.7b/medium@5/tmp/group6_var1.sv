```verilog
module clock_gen_forever;
  reg clk, en;
  // Generate clock using forever loop, controlled by 'en'
  always @(posedge en)
    for (int i=0; i<5; i++) #(2*i) clk = ~clk; // Toggle clock every 2*i time units forever
  initial
  begin
    clk = 1'b0; // Initialize clock
    en = 1'b0; // Start disabled
  end
  initial $monitor("clk=%b, t=%0d, en=%b ", clk,$time,en);
endmodule
```
In this modified code, a for loop is used that cycles 5 times (from i=0 to i=4). The system time advances by the double of the current index for each iteration, thus, the clock toggles after 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 time units, instead of every 2 time units as in the original example. This introduces slight variations in the timing of the clock signal, which can be useful for testing time-related behavior in digital systems. The initial state of 'clk' is set to 1'b0 and 'en' is set to 1'b0, as in the original example. The $monitor statement is left unchanged to remain consistent with the original code.### Note: 
Due to the asynchronous nature of the Verilog delay mechanism, the timing of the clock toggling and the timing of the looping can vary slightly over repeated executions of the module. However, in practice, the time difference between iterations of the loop is likely to be small enough not to cause noticeable flaws.

Additionally, keep in mind that this code is designed for simulation and does not generate a real-world clock at a processor core, so the timing may not precisely align with actual time units (usually in nanoseconds or picoseconds). In this case, it's intended to demonstrate how to create a clock signal that toggles every `2*i` time units, where i is the current loop index. However, in a real-world application involving hardware timing, it would be more appropriate to use a clock-divider or a clock generator module dedicated to generating a stable clock source.
