In this modified code, a 2D array `mux_array` is used to store the selected output. The index for this array is selected using a for loop and an if-else block which checks the `s` input. If `s` is 0, then the output is assigned as `a` otherwise it is assigned as `b`. The resultant array is then written to the `y` output. This variation is useful when the requirement is to select between multiple two-dimensional arrays depending upon the `s` input. 

Note: Make sure the indices of the 2D array `mux_array` and the inputs `a` and `b` are consistent (i.e., they have same width and range).

This code assumes that you are using a Verilog simulation tool that supports the `for` loop statement. If you are using a tool that does not support `for` loop such as Verilog (IV), you may need to replace the for loop with a series of if-else statements or a case statement. But this requires you to manually handle all the possible cases. 

Additionally, the width of the two input arrays `a` and `b` should be consistent in the code. The code does not include any checks for this, so it is recommended to always ensure that the widths of the input arrays `a` and `b` are consistent. It also does not check if the width of `a` and `b` matches with width of `y` and its also not handled in the code for
