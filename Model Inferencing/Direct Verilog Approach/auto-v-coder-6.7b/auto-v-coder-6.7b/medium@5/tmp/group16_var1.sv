```verilog
module mux24b(
input wire [3:0] a [0:3],
input wire [3:0] b [0:3],
input wire s,
output reg [3:0] y [0:3]
);
always @(*)
if(s == 0)
y = a;
else
y = b;
endmodule
```

This code also does a 2D mux on the input arrays. It assigns the values of array "a" to array "y" when the input "s" is 0, and the values of array "b" to array "y" when "s" is 1. If "s" is not 0 nor 1, the output array "y" will remain unchanged. 

Keep in mind that the size of the input and output arrays should be same. In the example code provided, the size of the arrays is [0:3]. If they are different in size, the larger array will have garbage values at the end and may cause unwanted behavior.

Also, it is recommended to use the'reg' keyword for output signals in Verilog to help with timing and debugging. 'wire' can sometimes hold unexpected values and can cause incorrect simulations.###

### Test Plan:

1. Input all possible values to array 'a' and array 'b'.
2. For each input combination, check the output array 'y' against the expected result.
3. Run the simulation several times until all the input combinations have been tested, checking that all outputs are as expected.

This tests both the mux's conditions and the correctness of the design, ensuring that it behaves as expected.###

Note: The variation was added to make the code more complex and demonstrate an actual use case for a 2D mux in Verilog. The original task was to implement a 2-to-1 mux using the always block in Verilog. The variation was to extend this to a 2D mux, where the 2D arrays are selected and used for comparisons. The complexity added here is in the form of an if block with a 2D array as the index expression, which is a common requirement in many Verilog designs.```verilog

input wire [
