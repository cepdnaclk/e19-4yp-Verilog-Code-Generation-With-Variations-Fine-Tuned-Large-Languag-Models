```verilog
module counter (
    input wire clk, rst,
    output reg [3:0] count
);
reg [3:0] cnt;

always @(posedge clk or posedge rst) begin
    if (rst) cnt <= 4'b0000;
    else cnt <= cnt + 1;
end

always @(posedge clk or posedge rst) begin
    if (rst) count <= 4'b0000;
    else begin
        if (cnt == 2) count <= cnt + 1;
        else count <= cnt;
    end
end
endmodule
```
In this variation, we make a second always block where our `if (cnt == 2) count <= cnt + 1;` branch is added, effectively increasing the count by one every time the counter passes the number 2. This serves to illustrate that even with a base counter, we can perform further conditional assignments based on the counter's state. This can be useful in various scenarios, such as a state machine or some other complex logic.

Please note that this is a simple example and you may need to replace `cnt == 2` with your actual condition. Also, this won't work with every counter because it depends on your specific counter implementation. The condition should be adjusted according the needs of your design.

In the original base code, the counter only counts up; here, it counts up to 2 and then increases the output by 1, demonstrating the possibility of additional conditional assignments based on the counter's state. 

In a real-world situation, you would likely replace `cnt == 2` with your own conditions.
