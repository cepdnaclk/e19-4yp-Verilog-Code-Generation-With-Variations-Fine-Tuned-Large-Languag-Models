In the modified code, we included an `initial` block inside which we introduce a loop that iterates two times. Each iteration, we use a `case` statement to assign different subsets of the integer `I` to a variable `a` based on the index of the `case` statement. In the first iteration, the 9th and 8th bits of `I` are assigned to `a`, and in the second iteration, the 7th and 6th bits of `I` are assigned to `a`. `$display` is then used to print out the values of `a`, `b`, and `I`. This demonstrates the use of a unique case expression and array-slice range in a logic-vector array. The simulation will run for 100 time units after the `#100` delay.### Note:

- The reason why the original code did not compile is because the `b` was not declared as a bit.
- In Verilog, indexing uses a one-based system, where the least significant bit (LSB) is at position 1. Therefore
