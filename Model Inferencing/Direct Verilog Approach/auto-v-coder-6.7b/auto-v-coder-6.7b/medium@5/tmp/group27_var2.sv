```verilog
module aoi_gate(o,a1,a2,b1,b2);
input a1,a2,b1,b2;
output o;
wire o1,o2;
and g1(o1,a1,a2);
and g2(o2,b1,b2);
nor g3(o,o1,o2);
  
wire [1:0] packed_array = {o1, o2};

always @* begin
  case (packed_array)
    2'b00: o = 1'b0;
    2'b01: o = 1'b1;
    2'b10: o = 1'b1;
    2'b11: o = 1'b0;
    default o = 1'bx;
  endcase
end

endmodule
```
In this modified code, we add a case statement inside the always block which uses an unpacked array with the values from the intermediate signals o1 and o2. This case statement will determine the output of the module o based on the input signals a1, a2, b1, and b2. The case statement checks each possible combination of the values in the packed array and outputs the corresponding value for o. The default case sets the output to 'x' for any other value in the packed array. This variation demonstrates the use of XMR-based hierarchical indexing to access data in a packed array. Note that this may introduce additional complexity especially for larger designs and systems. Hence, it should be used wisely.

This code should be compilable and synthesizable by any Verilog-A compatible tools. The actual synthesis result will depend on the input values of the signals. It is more of a variation or extension of the original code. The original code is already a good practice.
