```verilog
module contres(o,i1,i2);
input i1,i2;
output o;
// Drive wire 'o' from two buffers with specified output strengths
buf(pull1, weak0) g1(o,i1); // Drives pull '1', weak '0'
buf(pull1, weak0) g2(o,i2); // Drives pull '1', weak '0'
// Resolution: 1,1->1; 1,0->1; 0,1->1; 0,0->0; 1,Z->1; 0,Z->X; Z,Z->Z
// Effective behavior is OR due to pull1 dominance over weak0

This code introduces an 'initial' block with a loop that will generate different random values at 'o' over 4 cycles. It is just a simple example to illustrate the concept. Modify or remove it to suit your actual requirement.

Please note that this code will not synthesize because it is testing a random value within a loop and using '$urandom_range(i)' which is not supported in some simulators or tools. Also, the random value 'o' should not be synchronous to i1 or i2.

To guarantee a proper simulation, you should use an independent variable or non-blocking assignment for 'o'.

This solution is only intended for simulation purposes. In actual hardware design, you should avoid using any kind of random functions. Instead, use standard Verilog logic gates (like OR) for this kind of behavior. The solution shown here will not synthesize in any reasonable hardware design tool. If you are looking for a hardware solution, you can use an OR gate or latch as shown in the initial example. If you are looking for a different behavior
