```verilog
module mux21b (
input wire [1:0][1:0] a,
input wire [1:0][1:0] b,
input wire [1:0] s,
output reg [1:0] y // Output must be reg for procedural assignment
);
always @(*) // Combinational sensitivity
begin
case(s)
2'b00: y = a[0]; // Select a if s=0
2'b01: y = a[1]; // Select a if s=1
2'b10: y = b[0]; // Select b if s=2
2'b11: y = b[1]; // Select b if s=3
endcase
end
endmodule
```
In this modified version, the code will work for 2x2 array. The 2-bit `s` input will determine which of the four `a` array elements or `b` array elements will be selected, and their corresponding values will be assigned to the `y` output. The selection is based on the binary value of `s` where `00` selects the first element of `a`, `01` the second, `10` the first of `b`, and `11` the second. This allows for an arbitrary number of bits for either operand and a number that is a power of 2. For example, for 4-bit operands, the `s` input would be 2 bits, and the `y` output would be 4 bits. This also enables the use of case statements instead of if-else statements, which can be more efficient in Verilog for synthesizable code.

Do note that in this modified code, you need to have a `s` value of 2'b00 when you want to select the first element of `a`, 2'b01 for the second, and so on. If you want to select the first element of `b` when `s` is 2'b10, you would need to adjust the case statement accordingly. This can be done based on the specific requirements of your design. 

Also, be aware that this will not synthesize if the number of inputs/operands is not a power of 2, as Veril
