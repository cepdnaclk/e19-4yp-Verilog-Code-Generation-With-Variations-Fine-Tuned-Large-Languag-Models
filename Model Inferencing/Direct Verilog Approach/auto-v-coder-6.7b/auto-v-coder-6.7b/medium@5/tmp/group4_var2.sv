```Verilog
module nor3NMOS(in1,in2,in3,b); // 3-input NMOS NOR
  output b;
  input in1,in2,in3;
  supply0 a; // Ground
  wire b; // Output wire (should be just output b;)
  // Parallel NMOS transistors connect output to ground
  nmos (b, a, in1);
  nmos (b, a, in2);
  nmos (b, a, in3);
  pullup (b); // Pullup device on the output
endmodule
```

The original code is correct, but it does not contain an error or any changes. It simply defines a module named nor3NMOS with 3 input and 1 output. The module is equivalent to a 3-input NMOS NOR gate, where the output is pulled high by a pull-up resistor.
