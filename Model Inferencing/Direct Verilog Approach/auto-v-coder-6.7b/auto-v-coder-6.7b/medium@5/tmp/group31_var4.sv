This code adds an if-statement to select a 3D array slice based on the inputs. The if-statement will be true only when all inputs fall within the range [0, 5). This is just a simple example and for a larger project, the 3D array might be part of the input or output ports of the module.
Keep in mind that your design might not allow for all the input ranges since the task of determining the ranges depend on your system's specifications. This is just an example of how to use the Verilog if-statement to select a 3D array slice.
Note: This code assumes that all input ranges are from 0 to 4 as the example. Adjust this according to your requirements. For inputs that are not in the valid range, any assignments to xReg and yReg will not occur. 
The `xReg` and `yReg` variables will only be 1 when all inputs are between 0 and 4, otherwise they will be 0. This can be used as a control mechanism to control the operation of your design.
This code does not include the 3D array
