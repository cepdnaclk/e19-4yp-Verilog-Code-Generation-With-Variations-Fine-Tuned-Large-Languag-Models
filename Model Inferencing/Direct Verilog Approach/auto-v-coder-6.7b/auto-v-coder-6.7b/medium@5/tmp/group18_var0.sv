In the following code, instead of using function-call to assign value to a, b and c, we use array to initialize these values. The `$random()%2` is a system task that gives a random value between 0 to 1.
```verilog
timescale 1ns/100ps
module maj3_p (input a, b, c, output y);
wire [2:0] im = {a, b, c};
wire im1, im2, im3;
parameter
    tplh1=2, tphl1=4,
    tplh2=3, tphl2=5;
and #(tplh1, tphl1)
    (im1, im[0], im[1]),
    (im2, im[1], im[2]),
    (im3, im[2], im[0]);
or #(tplh2, tphl2) (y, im1, im2, im3);
endmodule
```
In the modified code, `{a, b, c}` is an array that contains values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. Instead of using function-call `$random()%2` to assign values to `a`, `b` and `c`, we use this array. The `#(tplh1, tphl1)` signifies a delay of 2 ns for the first input, 4 ns for the second input and so forth. Similarly, `#(tplh2, tphl2)` is used for the output delay. 

Note: This version of the code doesn't really change the function of the original code, as the function-call `$random()%2` was already used for assigning random values to a, b, and c. Here, I've used a different approach to assign values to a, b, c, and the `#()` syntax to specify delays.

Remember, the purpose of the modifications is to demonstrate a way to modify the code to handle different scenarios, such as different delays for inputs and outputs, or to use a different data source for the inputs. In other scenarios, such as `$random()`, the original code would be similar for different inputs.
