```Verilog
module reg4(D, Clock, Resetn, Q);
input [3:0] D;
input Clock, Resetn;
output [3:0] Q;
reg [3:0] Q;
reg [3:0] dynArr[1:2];
integer index = 1;
always @(posedge Clock or negedge Resetn)
    if (Resetn == 0) begin
        Q <= 4'b0000;
        index <= 1;
    end else begin
        Q <= D;
        dynArr[index] <= D;
        if(index == 2) index <= 1;
        else index <= index + 1;
    end
endmodule
```
In this variation, a dynamic array `dynArr` is created with a size of 2. In the sequential part, each input `D` is being assigned to the `index`-th position of the `dynArr`. The `index` variable is being updated to point to the next position in the array. When the `index` reaches 2, it resets back to 1. This is a simple implementation of a shift register.

This verilog code is a basic register with an asynchronous active low reset that stores the 4-bit wide input `D`. At the same time, the output `Q` will also have the same value as the input `D`. This verilog module is synchronous to the clock and it will respond to both positive and negative edge of the clock. Upon reset, the output `Q` will be reset to `0000`. Otherwise, `Q` will take on the value from the input `D` at each clock edge.

Please note that the `index` variable and the array `dynArr` are used for educational purposes to showcase the ability of procedural continuous assignments and dynamic arrays in Verilog. In this specific case, the dynamic array is a simple shift register and `index` is used to select the next position in the array where the input `D` should be stored. This might be useful in some specific situations. However, in general, you should use a dedicated data structure or shift register directly in your design wherever possible.
