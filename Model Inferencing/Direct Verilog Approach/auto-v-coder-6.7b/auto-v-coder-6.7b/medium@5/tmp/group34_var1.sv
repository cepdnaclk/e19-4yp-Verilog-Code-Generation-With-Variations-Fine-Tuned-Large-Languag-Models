parameter PRIORITY_XOR = 2;

// priority case

  case (PRIORITY_AND)
    PRIORITY_AND: ld <= out_and4;

endmodule
```

In the modified code, I added a parameter declaration for the priority order. This allows you to control the order by which the operations are applied. When the module is instantiated, you can choose the priority order by setting the value of the `PRIORITY_AND`, `PRIORITY_OR`, `PRIORITY_XOR` constants.

This code creates a priority case statement to select the output from the four gates based on the priority constant. If the PRIORITY_AND constant is set, the output will be selected from the AND results. If the PRIORITY_OR constant is set, the output will be selected from the OR results and so on.

Note that this is a simple priority case, and in a more complex design, you might want to use a different approach for selecting the output based on priority. For example, you might have several priority levels or a more complex mux structure. This example should give a basic idea of how you might add priority handling to your design. ### Verification Code:
