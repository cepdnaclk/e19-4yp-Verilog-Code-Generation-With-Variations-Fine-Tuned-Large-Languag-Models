```verilog
initial begin
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) begin
        $display("Array Value: %0d", array[f(i)])
    end
end

function int f(int x);
    return x * 2 + 1;
endfunction

reg [3:0] array [1:4] = '{1,2,3,4}; // array initialized
```
In this example, the "f" function is defined to receive an integer and return a value based on a provided formula. Then, inside the initial block, inside a for loop that iterates 5 times, the function "f" is called to generate the index for accessing the elements of the array. This index is used to display the value of the array.

Note: This code is part of a larger simulation model and is not complete without the necessary wiring and connections. It's been simplified here for the purpose of illustrating a function call inside the initial block. The actual use of these variables and the resulting dataflow will depend on the context in which they are used.

You can also use these concepts with a more complex or multiple array assignments and functions. The main idea is to generate a indexed value to access the array values in a systematic manner. This can help with generating test patterns, debugging, or any other operations that require generating a sequence of values from an array.### Testing the Code:

Verilog simulations require a specific environment and toolset to run your code. However, it can be tested in an environment where you can compile and run the code. To run the code, you can use a Verilog simulator such as Icarus Verilog, GHDL, or other similar tools. Be sure to install and configure these tools on your computer before attempting to run this code. 

For example, using GHDL (Gregory Hartman's Design Environment):

1. Save the Verilog code in a file, for example, aoi2.v.
2. In the terminal, navigate to the directory where aoi2.v is located.
3. Run the following command to compile the Verilog code:
```
ghdl -a aoi2.v
```
4. Run the following command to start the simulation:
```
ghdl -r aoi
