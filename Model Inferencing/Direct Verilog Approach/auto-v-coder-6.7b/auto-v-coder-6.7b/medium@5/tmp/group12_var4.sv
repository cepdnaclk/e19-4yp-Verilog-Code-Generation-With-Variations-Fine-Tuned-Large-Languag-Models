```SystemVerilog
module maj3 (a, b, c, y);
input a, b, c;
output y;
wire im1, im2, im3;
and #(2, 4)
    (im1, a, b),
    (im2, b, c),
    (im3, c, a);
or #(3, 5) (y, im1, im2, im3);

always @(*) begin
    logic [2:0] packed_array [1:3];
    packed_array[1][2:0] = {im1, im2, im3};
    y = (packed_array[1] == 3'b111)? 1 : 0;
end
endmodule
```
This will give you the same logic as before, but instead of using the output directly, you will write a single bit to an array, and then use a system task (the always block) to read from the array and set your output based on the value. This is not necessary for the exact logic in this case, but it's a simple example of how you might modify a Verilog module to use a different data type for a specific purpose. 

Please note that Verilog doesn't have a concept of a packed array of bits, so we're using a packed array of packed arrays of bits, which is not a very usual use case, but it's a demonstration of how you might do it. This also implies that you have to be careful about data type size and bit order when using packed arrays.

Remember Verilog is a procedural language and it's not recommended to use always blocks for combinational logic, as for some synthesis tools it can cause the synthesis process to fail. For such types of situations, it is recommended to use Verilog's combinational logic expressions or use a dedicated synthesisable logic design.### 

Please also note that the always block is only synthesizable and will not produce a correct output for the simulation in any tool. It is only used for synthesis. In simulation, the logic inside the always block will be evaluated for each clock cycle, but it will not affect the simulation results.

Also, it's important to note that the above code doesn't represent any real hardware design. The usage of
