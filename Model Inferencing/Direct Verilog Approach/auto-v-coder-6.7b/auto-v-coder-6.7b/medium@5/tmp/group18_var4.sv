In this modified code, the instruction inside the always block is now part of the expression used by the function-call return. However, the function-call return does not yet generate any array output. Thus, we can't include the result array inside the always block yet. This is a placeholder on how you might alter the code depending on the nature of your function-call return.

The code given above is a basic example, and the actual implementation can depend on how you define your function. You'll need to generate the appropriate array based on your function's return and then you can include this array inside the always block. This is an example on how you might include values from an array inside a verilog always block. The actual implementation might vary based on the type of function you're using. 

Also keep in mind that this code is a simple example. You may need to adjust the parameters, time delays, and connections according to the specifics of your function-call return and your code environment.```verilog
