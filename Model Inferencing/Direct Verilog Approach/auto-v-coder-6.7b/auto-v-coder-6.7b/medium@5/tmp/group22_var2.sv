```
module nil;
reg [7:0] array [7:0];
initial
begin
    for (int i=0; i<8; i++) begin
        array[i] = i;
    end
end

always @(posedge array[4]) begin
    if (array[4][0]) $display ("Array[4][0] is true");
end

always @(posedge array[6]) begin
    if (array[6][3]) $display ("Array[6][3] is true");
end
endmodule
```
The modified code includes and initializes an 8-bit array. The always block following is triggered by a posedge on array[4], and displays a message if array[4]'s 0th bit is true. In addition, another always block is triggered by a posedge on array[6], and displays a message if array[6]'s 3rd bit is true. The array[4] and array[6] are part selects on the array.

Note: This will not work as expected in the base code, as `nil` is not a valid Verilog identifier. This modified code should function in a Verilog simulator.

Also, keep in mind that verilog has a fixed time unit in nanoseconds, so any delay of 2ns in the simulation means a posedge event will occur after 2ns. The time delay used in this code is not in nanoseconds but in the simulation model's fixed time unit. Also, Verilog does not have a built-in array indexing operator, so we're using part selects on the array, which is equivalent to slicing. If you wanted to use a more Verilog-conform way to index the array, you could use a parameterized block of code to set the value at a specific index.

Remember that this code is quite straightforward and has not been designed with real-world performance in mind. It's only meant to demonstrate a simple Verilog feature. In production code, you should be careful about things like setting the value of an array at every loop iteration and using the array as a part-select to trigger a clock edge. In real-world scenarios, you'll likely need a more complex mechanism for triggering the always block.
