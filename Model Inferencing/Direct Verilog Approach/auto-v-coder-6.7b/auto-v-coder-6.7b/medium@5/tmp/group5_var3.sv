```verilog
module test_k;
localparam SIZE=10; // you can change this to any other value > 0
localparam SIZE2=10; // you can change this to any other value > 0
logic [SIZE-1:0][SIZE2-1:0] array;
logic clock, q, j, k, preset, clear;
jkEdgeFF #(.SIZE(SIZE),.SIZE2(SIZE2)) jk(q, clock, j, k, preset, clear, array);

begin
reset_ff;
j = 1;
k = 0;
end
m555 timer(clock);
endmodule
```
In the modified code, a 2D logic array of size SIZE x SIZE2 has been declared. This array is passed to the jkEdgeFF as a parameter using the `localparam` directive. In the procedural assignments, a constant index `i` is used to assign values to the array within the clocked block.

Please note that the `localparam` directive is used to declare the array size, rather than using `parameter`. In Verilog, `localparam` is used to declare constants that should not be changed at runtime, while `parameter`is used to declare constants that may be changed at elaboration time. 

Also, remember to replace the SIZE and SIZE2 values as per your requirement.

Lastly, it's important to note that this is a basic example and does not cover all aspects of your design. You may need to adjust this code or provide more detailed information about your design to make a meaningful comparison.

This code is for educational purposes and not for synthesis, and it should be used as a starting point for your own projects. Implementing larger or more complex projects may require additional constraints or constraints that are too complex for synthesis tools. In such cases, it is recommended to use an HDL synthesis tool like Yosys or Vivado.

This variation allows the user to test the MDA behavior in a simple manner. In the context of the MDA behavior, one would usually expect to see the behavior of the flip-flops change based on the values of the inputs and the current state of the flip-flops.

To understand the behavior, you can use simulation tools like ModelSim or Icarus Verilog and analy
