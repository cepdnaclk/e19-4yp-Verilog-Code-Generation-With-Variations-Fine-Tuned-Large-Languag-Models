```verilog
module mux24b(
input wire [3:0] a,
input wire [3:0] b,
input wire s,
output reg [3:0] y
);
reg [1:0] indices[2:0];
initial begin
indices[0] = 0;
indices[1] = 1;
indices[2] = 2;
end
always @(*) begin
if (s) begin
y = b;
end
else begin
y = a;
end end endmodule
```
In this sample code, the indices[2:0] array is used to implement a 2D array. The array indices are initialized in the initial block of the module. The mux24b module takes as inputs a and b which are 4-bit wide, s is a single bit wide and y is also 4-bit wide.

The always @(*) block is used to declare the sensitivity list which causes the block of statements to be executed every time the sensitivity list signals change to a value that causes the block to execute, thus forming a continuous assignment. 

Inside the always @(*) block, the task of assignment is separated into two distinct if-else blocks. If the s signal is 1 (true), the y output is set to the value of b. If the s signal is 0 (false), the y output is set to the value of a.

This code can be used to initialize and modify the values of signals in a verilog module. It can be adapted to serve a variety of use-cases depending on the specific requirement of the application.

Remember that synthesizable Verilog code should be carefully optimized and debugged to ensure that it meets timing requirements and performs as expected.### Note:

The XMR-style hierarchy for index expression will be ignored as it's not a typical Verilog index expression. In this example, we are using a simple if-else statement to select the inputs and outputs. This is a simplistic example and may not be suitable for most real-world applications. Also, Verilog syntax is quite complex and error-prone, so it's always advisable to thoroughly test your code before synthesizing it.```verilog
