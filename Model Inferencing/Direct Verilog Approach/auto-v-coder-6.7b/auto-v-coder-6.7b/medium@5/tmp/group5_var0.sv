In this modified code, an 2D logic array `testArray` is declared and assigned a value using a procedural block. The value of the declared 2D array is read in another procedural block to ensure that the behavior is correctly captured. The index `1` is arbitrarily chosen.

This allows us to test the MDA (Mapped Drives Architecture) behavior for the 2D array in Verilog. We can use this as a way to test the behavior of different mapped drives and how to handle such complex data structures in Verilog.

This modification should not affect the functionality of the flop (jkEdgeFF) because the assignment and read operation are not synchronized with the clock. The `always @ (posedge clock)` block ensures that the procedural operations are executed in the clock edge.

Remember to replace `reset_ff` with the actual method for resetting the flop in your code. Also, make sure that the M555 counter is correctly connected to the clock signal.

Please note that verilog supports 2D array, but the way we're accessing them is generally different from what we do in C/C++ or Python. Please refer to your specific synthesizer's documentation for the exact way to refer to 2D array elements. The example above uses a simple 2D array with indices [1:0][1:0].

Always ensure that the design is synthesizable and check the generated netlist for any errors. The testbench is also designed to drive the clock, so ensure that the M55
