```
module counter (
    input wire clk, rst,
    output wire [3:0] count
);
reg [3:0] reg_count; // Declare the register
wire [3:0] count_wire; // Declare the output wire
assign count_wire = reg_count; // Assign the register to the output wire
always @(posedge clk or posedge rst) begin
    if (rst) reg_count <= 4'b0000;
    else reg_count <= reg_count + 1;
end
assign count = count_wire; // Assign the output wire to the actual output port
endmodule
```
This code will behave exactly like the original one, with slight modification to the output wire assignment. It will now output the value to the actual output port, instead of an internal register. This has no functional change but changes the way the output is produced, which is often more useful when driving signals outside the module, like in a systemverilog package. If this is not the intended behavior, adjust as needed. 

Note: The original module does not strictly need an output wire (`count`) as an extra signal can just output the register count directly. This variation is for clarity and to follow the coding conventions in practice. In a real project, the module can be designed to produce the behavior using the register directly.
  
This code uses one register and one wire to mimic the behavior of the original code. It increases the count on the positive edge of the clock and resets its value to 4'b0000 on the reset signal. It assigns the value to a register, and then it outputs it to the actual output port. This introduces a bit of complexity but allows for clarity in following the original module's behavior.

The modified code is useful for synthesis and can be used in a SystemVerilog package if the original behavior is desired. The output is now produced through a wire instead of an internal register, which could be useful in some synthesis scenarios.
