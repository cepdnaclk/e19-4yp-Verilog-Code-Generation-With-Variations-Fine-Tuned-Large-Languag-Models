This code creates two instances of the `aoi_gate` module with the same input and assigns the intermediate outputs to a packed array. Then, a case is used to decide the output based on the packed array. This is a trivial example, but it illustrates how one could combine the outputs from two instances of the same module to create a more complex logic gate, or use a multi-cycle process to decide the output.

Note: This design assumes that a1 and a2 are either 0 or 1, and b1 and b2 are either 0 or 1. If the input could be a value other than 0 or 1, the design would need to be modified to handle the possibility of garbage or invalid input.
