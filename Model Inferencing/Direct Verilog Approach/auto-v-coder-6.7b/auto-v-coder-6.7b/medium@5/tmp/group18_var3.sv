```verilog
timescale 1ns/100ps
module maj3_p (input a, b, c, output y);
wire im1, im2, im3;
parameter
    tplh1=2, tphl1=4,
    tplh2=3, tphl2=5;
and #(tplh1, tphl1)
    (im1, a, b),
    (im2, b, c),
    (im3, c, a);
or #(tplh2, tphl2) (y, im1, im2, im3);

always @(*)
    y = $any(a, b, c);
endmodule
``` 

In the modified code, the `always @(*)` block is used to make a continuous assignment. Inside the block, the output `y` is assigned the result of the `$any` function, which takes any number of arguments and evaluates to `1` if any of them are high, `0` otherwise. This `$any` function is useful when a system can sometimes operate based on the state of any of a collection of signals.

Please replace `$any` with `$or` if you want to use it like a `$or` function to check if any of the input signals are high.

Note: This code should only be used in simulation, as synthesis tools may not support the `$any` or `$or` functions in Verilog or SystemVerilog. Also, it is generally not recommended to use `always @(*)` in an actual design to avoid potential synthesis issues. ### Testbench:

```verilog
module testbench;
    reg a,b,c;
    wire y;
    maj3_p uut(a,b,c,y);

    initial begin
        a = 0;
        b = 0;
        c = 0;
    #100;
        a = 1;
    #100;
        b = 1;
    #100;
        c = 1;
    end
endmodule
```
Running this testbench will output `y` values for different input combinations.

This testbench will set `a`
