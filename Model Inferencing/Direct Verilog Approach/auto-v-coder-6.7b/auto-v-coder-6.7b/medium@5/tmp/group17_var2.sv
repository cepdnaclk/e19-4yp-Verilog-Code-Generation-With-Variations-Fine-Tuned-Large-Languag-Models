```verilog
module mux41b (
input wire [3:0] c,
input wire [1:0] s,
output reg z
);
  always @* begin
    case (s)
      2'b00: z = c[0];
      2'b01: z = c[1];
      2'b10: z = c[2];
      2'b11: z = c[3];
    endcase
  end
endmodule
```
Changes:
1. `reg` is used instead of `wire` for the output.
2. `always @*` block is used to continuously monitor the inputs.
3. `case (s)` is used to check the select lines.
4. Inside the `case` block, `z` is assigned the corresponding element from the input array `c`. The chosen `z` value is based on the values of the select lines `s`.

### Behavioral Description:
 
This variation code implements a 4 to 1 multiplexer. The select lines `s` select one of four input array elements `c` to be transferred to the output `z`. Whenever the value of `s` changes, the corresponding element from the `c` array is selected to be transferred to the output `z`. The value of `z` depends upon `c` and selection lines `s`. Hence, this code will produce a different output according to the current state of `s` and `c`. This is a functional equivalent to the original code and behaves as per the specified requirements.
