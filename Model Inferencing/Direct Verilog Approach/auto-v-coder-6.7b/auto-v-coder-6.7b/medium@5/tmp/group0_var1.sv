```verilog
module ha_8(s,ca,a,b); // Half Adder with specparam path delays
  input a,b; output s,ca;
  // Define specify parameter for s delay and ca delay
  parameter dl1 = 1;
  parameter dl2 = dl1 + 1;
  // Assign path delays using parameters and if condition
  specify
    (a, b *> s) = dl1;
    (a, b *> ca) = dl2;
    (a[0] || a[1] || a[2] || a[3]) = (a[0] && a[1] && a[2] && a[3]);
  endspecify
  xor (s,a,b);
  and (ca,a,b);
endmodule
```
In this code, the if condition `(a[0] || a[1] || a[2] || a[3]) = (a[0] && a[1] && a[2] && a[3])` checks whether the 4D packed logic array variable `a` is inside a range list of 4D packed logic array variables, and if it is, it assigns 1 to the output. If it's not, it assigns 0. The "||" operator in Verilog is a logical OR operator, and "&&" is a logical AND operator. 

This will generate a warning about the `if` condition's truth table, but the simulation should still behave as expected. The `if` condition is mainly used to ensure the correctness of the model in terms of its output. For optimizing the model, it's important to ensure that the `if` condition is not violated. In this case, the model should work correctly for any valid input.

The base Verilog code had a specification path delay added to the output signals `s` and `ca`. This feature can be useful for timing simulation tools to ensure accurate timing constraints. However, this code also shows an example of using `specparam` for specifying signal delays, which is generally not recommended for full synthesis. It's better to use `parameter` and `assign` for specifying signal delays.

Please note that the `if` condition in the example can vary
