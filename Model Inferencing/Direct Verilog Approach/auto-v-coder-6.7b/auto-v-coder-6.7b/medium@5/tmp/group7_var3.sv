```verilog
module contres(o,i1,i2);
input i1,i2;
output o;

logic [1:0] in;

initial begin
  in = 2'b00;
  #50;
  in = 2'b10;
  #50;
  in = 2'b01;
  #50;
  in = 2'b11;
  #50;
end

assign o = |in;

endmodule
```
This version is slightly more complex but demonstrates the concept of combining two inputs into an array and using an OR reduce operator to simulate the "effective behavior is OR due to pull1 dominance over weak0". The initial block is there to manually trigger the output `o` at different times and to demonstrate the behavior. The 2'b00,2'b10,2'b01,2'b11 assignments demonstrate four different input combinations. The `|` operator is used to perform the OR operation on each bit of the 2-bit array `in`, which is then assigned to the output `o`. This simulates the "Effective behavior is OR due to pull1 dominance over weak0" as specified.
It's important to note that this code doesnâ€™t perform any specific test over the system environment or the output strength to drive the input strength. The input strengths should be driven from the testbench or environment setup by controlling the logic level or applying control signals. This code is purely illustrative and shouldn't be used as a part of the model for a real-world implementation. However, it gives an insight into how the behavior of logic gates can be controlled.

This code is written in SystemVerilog syntax, which is a superset of Verilog that adds additional features for modeling complex systems. The `|` operator is a bitwise OR operator. The array assignment to `in` is a sequential assignment. The `#50;` is a delay where the output `o` is driven. This is done sequentially for four different input combinations. It's important to note that this initial block in this code does not reflect a real-world scenario. Hence, it is purely illustrative.

This code is suitable only for understanding how the logic can be implemented theoretically. Real implementation would
