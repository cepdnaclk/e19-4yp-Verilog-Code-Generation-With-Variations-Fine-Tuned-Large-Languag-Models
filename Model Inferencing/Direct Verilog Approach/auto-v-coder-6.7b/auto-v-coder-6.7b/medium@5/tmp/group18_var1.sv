```
In this code, a function 'func' is defined to generate an array with 6 values. The modified always block uses the function call to assign result array to array_result variable. Then, the y output is assigned the third value from the returned array.

This modification allows the designer to use the design-level functionality of generating arrays and using the results array values as input to assign a value to y in the always block. Please replace the '3' in array_result[3] with a different index if you want to use a different result from the returned array. The index should be within the range of index of the returned array. In this case, the index is between 0 and 5 inclusive. Please replace it with the correct index for your specific array generation needs. 

Note: This code is designed to be a simple example and may not represent all possible uses of functions in Verilog. In a more complex design, you might want to use another method of passing the value from the function to the design, such as a queue or wire.

Also, please note that this code does not verify the synthesizable or correctness of the
