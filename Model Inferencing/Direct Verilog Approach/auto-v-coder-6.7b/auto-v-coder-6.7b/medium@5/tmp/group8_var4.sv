```verilog
module dec2_4beh(output reg [3:0]o, input[1:0] i);
assign o[3:0] = (4'b0000 << i);
endmodule
```
This code will shift left the 4-bit register by the input value and assign the result to the output wire. If the input value is 2'b00, the output will be 4'b0000. If the input value is 2'b01, the output will be 4'b0001. If the input value is 2'b10, the output will be 4'b0010. If the input value is 2'b11, the output will be 4'b0011. This behavior will create a combinational logic.

Here's the modified code that uses an if statement to conditionally assign values to the output based on the input value:

```verilog
module dec2_4beh(output reg [3:0]o, input[1:0] i);
always @(i) begin
    if (i == 2'b00)
        o = 4'b0000;
    else if (i == 2'b01)
        o = 4'b0001;
    else if (i == 2'b10)
        o = 4'b0010;
    else if (i == 2'b11)
        o = 4'b0011;
    else
        o = 4'bxxxx;
end
endmodule
```
This code uses always blocks to continuously monitor the value of the input and assign the appropriate value to the output based on the input. If the input changes, the simulation will instantly update the output value. This will create a timing diagram like simulation. 

But please note that, if you want to use these as a hardware design, the later approach is preferred because the earlier approach will have combinational logic where any change in input will result in an immediate change in the output, which is not how real hardware works. 

In hardware, the output value has to be determined only when the input value changes or something triggers a change in the input that requires a change in
