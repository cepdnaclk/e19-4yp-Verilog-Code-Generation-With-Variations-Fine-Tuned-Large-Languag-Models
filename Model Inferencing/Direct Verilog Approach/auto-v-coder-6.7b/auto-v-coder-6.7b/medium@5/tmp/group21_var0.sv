The provided code is a base Verilog code for a NMOS inverter. It starts with the input being high (1'b1) and prints the time and the values of the input and output after approximately 15 time units.

To add a case statement, we will have to create a 4D array (for example, a 2D array with 2 rows and 2 columns) and use the input as an index to choose an output. We will then instantiate this array by calling the function and passing the input as an argument.

Here's the modified code:

```verilog
module tst_nm_in();
  reg [1:0] in; wire out;
  NMOSinv nmv(out,in); // Instantiate NMOS inverter
  always @(in) 
    out = array_4D[in[1]][in[0]]; // Using function call as index into array

  initial
    in =2'b11; // Start with input high -> output low

  always
    #1 $monitor($time, " in = %b, output = %b ",in,out);

  initial #15 $stop; // Stop simulation

  function [1:0] array_4D;
    input [1:0] index;
    begin
      case(index)
        2'b00: array_4D = 2'b01;
        2'b01: array_4D = 2'b10;
        2'b10: array_4D = 2'b00;
        2'b11: array_4D = 2'b11;
        default: array_4D = 2'bxx;
      endcase
    end
  endfunction

endmodule
```

In this code, the case statement inside the function `array_4D` is used to return the corresponding output based on the input. In case the input value is not within the range, the output value is considered as an indeterminate ('XX').

This variation is slightly different from the original code in that there is a function call used as an index into a 4D array. Note that this is a very simple example and is not representative
