```verilog
timescale 1ns/100ps
module ShiftRegister8 (input sl, sr, clk, input [7:0] ParIn, input [1:0] m, output reg [7:0] ParOut);
parameter [1:0] LEFT = 1, RIGHT = 2;
always @(negedge clk) begin
    case ({2'b00, m}) inside
        {2'b00, LEFT}: ParOut <= ParOut;
        {2'b00, RIGHT}: ParOut <= {ParOut[6:0], sr};
        default: ParOut <= 8'bX;
    endcase
end
endmodule
```
In the above modification, the case statement was modified to use a packed vector array select. The `{2'b00, m}` selects a dynamic range list that includes `m` and some dummy 2'b00 values. This works because the first 2'b00 are ignored due to the inside operator, and the result is compared against the range list. If the input `m` matches the dynamic range list, then the corresponding code block is executed, otherwise the default block is executed. This variation of the code is useful when you have a lot of parameters that you want to control in the same control flow. This will make the code more understandable and compact.
The `LEFT` and `RIGHT` parameters are defined using `parameter` keywords to make the code more readable and maintainable. They represent the values that `m` could take to control the shifting operation. The case statement uses these parameters to make the code cleaner and more understandable.
The `default: ParOut <= 8'bX;` line is responsible for setting undetermined or undefined values to 'X'. The `8'bX` line means that we do not know the value of `ParOut`. If any other case gets matched, it should be a case that should never happen and thus should not contain anything meaningful. In such scenarios, it is usually set to 'X' to denote that that case is unhandled or undetermined. 
This is a common practice to avoid unexpected behavior in the design. In Verilog, 'X' represents an unknown state or value. In programming, this is often used
