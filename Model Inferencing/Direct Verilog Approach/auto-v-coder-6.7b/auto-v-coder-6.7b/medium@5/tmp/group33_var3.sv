The following is the modified code:

```verilog
module tst_CMOSsw1();
  reg in,con; wire out;
  CMOSsw1 cmsw(out,in,con); // Instantiate CMOS switch
  initial begin in=1'b0; con=1'b1; end // Start enabled
  always #5 in =~in; // Toggle data
  always #3 con=~con; // Toggle control
  initial begin // monitor changes
    #0 $monitor($time, "in = %b, con = %b, output = %b ",in,con,out);
    $monitor("%d, %b, %b, %b", $time, in, con, out);
  end
  initial begin
    #10 $monitor("simulation stopped.");
    $stop; // Stop simulation
  end
endmodule
```

This code will print the value of `in`, `con`, and `out` every 5 time units and every 3 time units respectively. The monitor statements are moved inside the initial block and have different display format. The simulation stops after 10 time units and displays a message before that.

Note: The `CMOSsw1` is a module for the CMOS switch, this code will always produce the same output as `out` will be driven by `in` and `con`. The behavior of these inputs can be controlled with the stimulus.

This code can be used to check the functionality of the `CMOSsw1` module in the simulation. If the module is not working as expected, you will need to debug it. Otherwise, the code is correct and produces the expected outputs.

It is assumed the `CMOSsw1` module works correctly. The code may not be synthesizable without a definition of that module.

This code also introduces the concept of using `#0` for a delay-based monitor. This delay is used to wait for the initial block to start before the first monitor statement triggers the simulation. Therefore, it will not produce any waveform before the first `$monitor` statement is active. 

This allows the initial block to set up the simulation before starting the waveform display. 

Note: `CMOSsw1` is a placeholder, replace it with whatever the module
