```verilog
module example5(x1, x2, x3, f);
input x1, x2, x3;
output f;
reg f;
wire [7:0] packed_array = {x1, x2, x3, 1'b0, 1'b1, 1'b0, 1'b1, 1'b0};
wire [1:0] part_select_range = packed_array[5:4];
always @(x1 or x2 or x3 or part_select_range)
    if (x2 == 1)
        f = x1;
    else if ((part_select_range >= 2'b01) && (part_select_range <= 2'b10))
        f = 1'b1;
    else
        f = x3;
endmodule
```
This code will set the output `f` to 1 if the part-select from position 4 to position 5 of the `packed_array` is within the range of 2'b01 (decimal value 2) and 2'b10 (decimal value 4). If `x2` is not 1, the output `f` will be `x3`. 

Please note that the position in the part-select is from MSB to LSB. Also, the range [2'b01, 2'b10] is inclusive, which means it includes the values 2'b01 and 2'b10. So, the values that the part-select represents are 2'b01, 2'b10.

This variation shows a practical application where part-selecting a fixed constant range inside a packed array can be used for certain conditions based on the value of the array. It also introduces a variety of inputs and outputs for the design. 

Remember, the part-select range values should match with the expected values in the packed array to correctly interpret the range from the part select. Also, keep in mind that the part-select range in Verilog is inclusive of both end values. 

Also, keep in mind that this code is highly dependent on the exact values used in the part-select range and the actual values represented by the packed array.
