```verilog
`timescale 1ns/100ps
module ALU8 (input [7:0] left, right, input [1:0] mode, output reg [7:0] ALUout);
always_comb begin
    case (mode)
        0: ALUout = left + right;
        1: ALUout = left - right;
        2: ALUout = left & right;
        3: ALUout = left | right;
        default: ALUout = 8'bX;
    endcase
end
endmodule
```
### Explanation:
In the original code, ALUout is assigned a value inside an always @ block, which is a continuous assignment and not procedural assignment. This means that the assignment to ALUout is not controlled by other statements in the Verilog program, but rather by the sensitivity list (`always @(left, right, mode)`). 

In the modified code, the combinational logic is implemented using an always_comb block, which is a procedural assignment. This means that any changes to inputs (left, right, mode) will trigger the logic to be re-evaluated and the output (ALUout) to be updated.

When using an always_comb block, array part-selects (like left[3:0] or right[7:4]) as operands are supported, making it possible to implement operations on multiple parts of the data. This is very useful in cases where the operation is complex and requires multiple steps or multiple parts of the data to be processed. However, always_comb blocks are typically used for combinational logic, rather than sequential logic, where you need an always block with a sequence of statements.

So, the modified code is more compatible with Verilog best practices. However, in more complex designs, it's usually more appropriate to use always_comb blocks for combinational logic, and always_ff blocks for sequential logic. This is because different types of logic have different behavior and timing requirements, and using the right type of block can improve the efficiency and correctness of the design.```verilog
