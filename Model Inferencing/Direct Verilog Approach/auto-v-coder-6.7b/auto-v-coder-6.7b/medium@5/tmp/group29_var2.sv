The base verilog code can be modified to demonstrate the behavior inside a while loop by adding a function call for handling an indexed operation on a packed array.

Let's assume the following:

1. We have a packed array `packedArray[31:0]`.
2. We have a function `getBit(index)` which returns the `index`-th bit of the `packedArray`.

Here is the modified code:

```verilog
module muxdff(D0, D1, Sel, Clock, Q);
input D0, D1, Sel, Clock;
output Q;
reg Q;
always @(posedge Clock) begin
    if (!Sel)
        Q <= D0;
    else
        Q <= D1;
end

// Testing inside a while loop
integer i;
initial begin
    i = 0;
    while (i < 32) begin
        Q = getBit(i);
        $display("Q = %b", Q);
        i = i + 1;
    end
end
endmodule
```

This code creates a `muxdff` module that behaves as before, but it also includes a while loop to test the `getBit()` function inside `Q = getBit(i)`. It increments `i` by 1 each iteration to test all 32 bits of the `packedArray`. The result is printed as `Q = {bit}`.

Note: This example is purely illustrative and does not correspond to actual packed array and bit-getting function in Verilog, but it shows how to handle them in a similar fashion. The actual implementation depends on the specifics of the design and the programming language used.
