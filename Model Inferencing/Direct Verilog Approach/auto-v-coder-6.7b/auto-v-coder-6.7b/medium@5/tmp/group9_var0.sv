```verilog
module pulses;
  reg [7:0] I;
  reg a,b;
  initial
    while (I<100) begin
      b = I[2]; // Assign bit 2 of I to b
      b = I[1:0]; // Assign bit 1 to bit 0 of I to b
      I = I + 1;
    end
  initial I=0;
  initial #100 $stop;
endmodule
```
In this modified code, I have modified the indexing method to not only use the bit position but also slice it into a range. The original code snippet is assigning the bit 1 of the integer to an output `b`, and the modified code is assigning the bits 1 to 0 of the integer to `b`. This provides a variation and is a common coding technique in Verilog.

Note: This code will be synthesized and simulated on a specific FPGA or on a simulator that supports Verilog. Verilog is a hardware description language meant to describe the behavior of electronic systems in a way that is both readable by humans and understood by hardware synthesis tools. It is not directly executable on a computer system or hardware, but can be translated into digital hardware. 

Also, please be aware that bit-select (`[i:j]`) indices in Verilog are **not** 0-based like C or Python. In Verilog, the left-hand side of the range is inclusive, while the right-hand side is exclusive. This means that `[j:i]` is equivalent to the slice from bit i to bit j-1.
