```verilog
module example7_5(x1, x2, x3, Clock, f, g);
input x1, x2, x3, Clock;
output f, g;
reg f, g;
reg [2:0] x2_array;
always @(posedge Clock)
begin
    x2_array[0] = x1;
    x2_array[1] = x2;
    x2_array[2] = x3;
    case(x2_array[1]) // Selecting x2 as dynamic variable index
        1'b1: f = 1'b1;
        default: f = 1'b0;
    endcase
    g = f | x3;
end
endmodule
```
This code does the same thing as the original code. However, this time, the case statement is inside a process which checks the status of x2. If it's 1'b1, the signal f gets set to 1'b1. If not, it gets set to 1'b0. As a result, the output f will be 1'b1 only when x2 is 1'b1; otherwise, it will be 1'b0. The output g becomes a variable derived from the output f and the input x3.
This variation creates a control circuit using an array of input variables and a case statement to select a dynamic variable index. This allows the module to be flexible and dynamic. The case statement can select any input variable at run time. It is an example of a dynamic control statement.
You can replace the case statement condition with any custom condition and observe the output at runtime. It forms a basic control flow for the module, giving it more flexibility.

Please note that the above code is synthesizable. If a clock is not required or not provided, the code can be used as a simple logic gate, and logic variables can be connected to hardware blocks. The syntax may vary depending on the specific synthesis tool used.

Remember to modify the array indices and condition to suit your requirements and ensure you understand how the code works. This modification is a simple illustration of a more complex concept you could use. It is typically important to ensure your code is understandable, readable, and correct in all contexts.
