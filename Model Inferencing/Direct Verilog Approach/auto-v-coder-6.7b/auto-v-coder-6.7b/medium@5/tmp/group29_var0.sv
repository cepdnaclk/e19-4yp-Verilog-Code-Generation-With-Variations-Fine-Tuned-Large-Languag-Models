```verilog
module muxdff(D0, D1, Sel, Clock, Q);
input D0, D1, Sel, Clock;
output Q;
reg Q;
always @(posedge Clock)
    if (!Sel)
        Q <= D0;
    else
        Q <= D1;
endmodule


module muxdff_arr(D0, D1, Sel, Clock, Q);
input  [3:0] D0;
input  [3:0] D1;
input  [2:0] Sel;
input  Clock;
output [2:0] Q;
reg [2:0] Q;
always @(posedge Clock)
    for(i = 0; i < 3; i++)
        if (!Sel[i])
            Q[i] <= D0[i];
        else
            Q[i] <= D1[i];
endmodule
```
In this variation, `muxdff_arr` creates a multi-bit MUX with D0 and D1 as arrays and Sel as a selection signal. Its output Q is also an array of bit. The MUX element is selected according to the Sel vector. If Sel[i] is 0, the corresponding MUX output Q[i] is assigned D0[i]. If Sel[i] is 1, the corresponding MUX output Q[i] is assigned D1[i].
 
This code is based on a common design pattern for implementing combinatorial logic using synchronous logic and register elements to store the result of the operation. For instance, a 2-to-1 multiplexer using a D flip-flop in Verilog could be implemented using the mentioned `muxdff` module, where Q is the output of the MUX, D0 and D1 are the two inputs, Sel is the select control input, and Clock is the clock that determines when the MUX operation happens. The `muxdff_arr` module extends this pattern by creating a 2-to-1 MUX with two vectors of four bits each, as shown above. The module's output is an array of four bit output signals, and the inputs to this module are two 4-bit vectors and a 3-bit
