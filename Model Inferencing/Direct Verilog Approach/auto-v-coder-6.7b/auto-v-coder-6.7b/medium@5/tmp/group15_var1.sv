```Verilog
timescale 1ns/100ps
module ALU8 (input [7:0] left, right, input [1:0] mode, output [7:0] ALUout);
always_comb begin
    case (mode)
        0: ALUout = left + right;
        1: ALUout = left - right;
        2: ALUout = left & right;
        3: ALUout = left | right;
        default: ALUout = 8'bX;
    endcase
end
endmodule
```
In this variation, I have replaced the reg keyword with the output keyword, which is used for output port declaration. The case statement is also encapsulated inside an always_comb block, which is the recommended way to describe combinational logic in Verilog. This allows the synthesis tool to optimize the logic and reduce the latency of the ALU operations. This also eliminates the possibility of having flip-flops in the synthesized design. Note that the use of a case statement with the default case is optional and not necessary in this case. This will ensure that when the mode is not 0, 1, 2, or 3, the output is undefined, which is equivalent to zeros in this case.### 

Also, we have made the ALU out as an output port and to modify it in the module. This way, the synthesized hardware will be optimized to handle these operations more efficiently.

This modified code does not use any flip-flops or registers inside the ALU module, thus resulting in a smaller resource usage and a faster execution time. Moreover, the behavior is more reliable, as the design will only change output when the inputs or the control signals change, which is the behavior one would expect from an ALU.### 

Remember to synthesize (compile) your code for verification. The result can be compared to the base code to check if the optimizations have taken effect.

The output port ALUout is now an array of bits (of size 8), which can accommodate more complicated operations, such as left shifting, right shifting, or bit extension. This can be optimized using the bit manipulation functions in Verilog.
