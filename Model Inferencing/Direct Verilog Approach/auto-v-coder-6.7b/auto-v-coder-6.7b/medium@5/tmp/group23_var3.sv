```verilog
module RAM (output[7:0] Obus, input[7:0] Ibus, input[3:0] Adr, input Clk, Read);
reg[7:0] Storage[15:0];
reg[7:0] ObusReg;
assign #1 Obus = ObusReg;
always @(posedge Clk)
begin
if (Read==1'b0)
    Storage[Adr] <= Ibus;
else
    ObusReg <= Storage[Adr];
// adding a while loop
    int i;
    while(i<10) begin
        ObusReg <= Storage[i];
        i = i + 1;
    end
end
endmodule
```
The code adds a while loop that will display storage[i] every time Clk is activated. The loop will run 10 times before exiting. This variation introduces another way of accessing the Storage array. The while loop can be beneficial in certain conditions, such as when you want to read multiple data from the storage array. ### Disclaimer:
The code is meant to illustrate programming logic and may not serve as a functional part of the system, as the logic presented in this code is purely theoretical and not applicable in the context of a real-world system. This modification should be adjusted to suit your specific application. 

Remember to provide a reset signal for the RAM if you are using this logic as a part of other modules. A synchronous reset should be provided to reset the storage memory and also to clear the ObusReg when it is not needed. This is to avoid any potential issues in the system that can arise due to incorrectly initialized values in the storage arrays.

Also, keep in mind that the design can be simplified and optimized without the while loop if it is not needed. It is best to test the code thoroughly before implementing it on a real chip or system.```verilog
