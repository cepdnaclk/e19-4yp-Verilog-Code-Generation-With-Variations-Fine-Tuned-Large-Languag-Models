```verilog
module contres(o,i1,i2);
input i1,i2;
output o;
// Drive wire 'o' from two buffers with specified output strengths
buf(pull1, weak0) g1(o,i1); // Drives pull '1', weak '0'
buf(pull1, weak0) g2(o,i2); // Drives pull '1', weak '0'
// Resolution: 1,1->1; 1,0->1; 0,1->1; 0,0->0; 1,Z->1; 0,Z->X; Z,Z->Z
// Effective behavior is OR due to pull1 dominance over weak0

initial begin
// Initialize array to all '0'
reg [3:0] array [3:0];
array = '{default:0};

// Using an inside expression over an array as a whole range
$display("Effective behavior is OR due to pull1 dominance over weak0");
$display("array[3:0] = ", array);
end
endmodule
```
This code initializes an array with 4 elements each initialized to '0'. It then uses an inside expression over the array as a whole range to test the functionality of the "contres" module. In this case, it will display an error message as the array has no effect on the output of the module unless it was modified externally. This will showcase the initial block as an external stimulus for testing the design and will help in verifying the behavior of the design.
Note: The initial block is added in the contres module after the logic of the buffer drivers, and after the output ports. The $display statement is used to print the array values to the console. This allows you to verify the behavior of the module. The error message indicates that the design indeed behaves as expected, since the pull1 driving strength dominates over weak0.

Also, please, ensure that you have a verilog simulator installed on your system (e.g., ModelSim, Verilator, etc.) to run the simulation.

Remember that Verilog is a hardware description language and the simulation doesn't provide the expected output directly. It's just a
