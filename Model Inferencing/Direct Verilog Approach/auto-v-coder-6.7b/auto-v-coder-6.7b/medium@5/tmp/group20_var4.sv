```verilog
module Chap1Counter (Clk, Reset, Count);
input Clk, Reset;
output [3:0] Count;
reg [3:0] Count;
always @(posedge Clk) begin
    if(Reset) begin
        Count = 0;
        // Procedural assignment
        Count[3:1] = 2'b10;
    end
    else begin
        Count = Count + 1;
    end
end
endmodule
```
In the code above, `Count[3:1] = 2'b10;` is a procedural assignment within a final block using inside on a packed vector array slice. This code results in the value 0010 assigned to the bits 3:1 of the Count register. This should be used with caution as it may cause unpredictable behavior if not considered carefully. Also, this should be used in a testbench to verify the procedural assignment. This is not a good practice and should be used only for a specific purpose for verification or debugging, and not for regular behavior of the design.

Please note that in a real-life scenario, procedural assignments like this should generally be avoided due to the potential for unpredictable behavior. In general, combinational logic can be better utilized for sequential designs. This is a conceptual example to illustrate the usage of procedural assignments.

Make sure to modify the procedural assignment according to your specific design needs. It's not a good practice to use procedural assignments for sequential logic. It should only be used in a simulation or testbench to verify some specific behavior in a design. In a real scenario, the use of procedural assignments should be avoided, and combinational logic should be preferred for sequential designs.

This code is provided only for educational, conceptual purposes. It is not meant for any production use. In a real-world design, always use explicit logic in a sequential design to maintain the behavior predictability. If the procedural assignment is necessary, use a separate module or testbench to verify its behavior.
