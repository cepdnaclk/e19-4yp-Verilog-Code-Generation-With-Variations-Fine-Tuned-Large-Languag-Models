This modification randomly selects an operation to perform on `x1` and `x2` and then performs that operation and OR with `x3`. This variation will help test the design for any possible bit operation that can be performed on `x1` and `x2`. It also allows to check the robustness of the design with various input conditions.### Note:
Please note that the code snippets provided here are intended for educational and experimental purposes. Always check with the actual implementation and the specific hardware setup. Also, ensure to include necessary input and output ports in your verilog code as per the requirement. 

Additionally, you should replace the `$urandom_range(0,2)` function with a different random function according to your hardware platform. `$urandom_range(0,2)` is a function in Verilog to generate a random number between 0 to 2.

Also, be aware of the fact that verilog simulator does not support the case statement with dynamic expression. So, if you are using tool simulator in which you cannot handle dynamic case statement, you might have to create a multiplexer with 6 inputs (or 2 to the power `n` where `n` is the number of cases) and connect `x1`, `x2` and `x3` to it and its output to `f`. And this output `f` to the `g`.

If you are using a synthesis tool, `$urandom_range(0,2)` can be used as it is supported everywhere. However, if you are using a simulator, tools like ModelSim or Icarus Verilog, you
