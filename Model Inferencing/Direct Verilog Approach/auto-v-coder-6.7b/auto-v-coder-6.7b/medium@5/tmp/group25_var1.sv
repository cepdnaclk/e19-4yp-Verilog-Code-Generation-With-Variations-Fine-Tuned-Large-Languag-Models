```verilog
module example7_5(x1, x2, x3, Clock, f, g);
input x1, x2, x3, Clock;
output f, g;
reg f, g;

always @(posedge Clock)
begin
    f = x1 & x2;
    g = f | x3;
end

endmodule
```
In this variation, the code remains unchanged as the "f" and "g" assignments are always evaluated at the same time when a positive clock edge is detected. However, if you want to modify the code to fit the desired behavior, you can include the case statement to select array element using a dynamic variable index.

Here's an example:
```verilog
module example7_5(x1, x2, x3, Clock, f, g);
input x1, x2, x3, Clock;
output f, g;
reg f, g;
reg [0:2] arr;
reg [0:2] arr = {x1, x2, x3};

always @(posedge Clock)
begin
    case (arr[2])
    1'b0: begin
        f = arr[0] & arr[1];
        g = f | arr[2];
    end
    1'b1: begin
        f = arr[1] & arr[2];
        g = f | arr[0];
    end
    endcase
end

endmodule
```
This code will select an array element based on the value of the third element "x3" and evaluate "f" and "g" accordingly. Please note that this code is specific to your needs and may need to be adjusted for the specific cases.

The case statement will select an index '1' for 'arr[2]' which is '1' based on the value of 'x3'. If 'x3' is 1, the case will select the second element ("x2") as the operand for 'f' and the third element ("x3") as the operand for 'g'. Otherwise, it will select the second element ("x2") as the operand for 'f' and the first element ("x1") as the operand for 'g'.
