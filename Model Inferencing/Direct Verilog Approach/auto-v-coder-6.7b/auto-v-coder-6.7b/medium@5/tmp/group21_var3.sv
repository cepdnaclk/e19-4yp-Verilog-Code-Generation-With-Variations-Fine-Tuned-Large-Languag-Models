```verilog
module tst_nm_in();
  reg in; wire out;
  NMOSinv nmv(out,in); // Instantiate NMOS inverter
  initial
    in =1'b1; // Start with input high -> output low
  always
  initial begin
    #100 $stop;
    $monitor($time, " in = %b, output = %b ",in,out);
    case ({in,out})
      // 4D array with function call as index
      4'b0000 : in = 1'b1;
      4'b0100 : in = 1'b0;
      4'b1010 : in = 1'b0;
      // add additional cases as needed
      default : $display("Unhandled case");
    endcase
  end
endmodule
```

Please, replace the "// add additional cases as needed" comment with your own logic. You may also add more elements to the 4D array to handle more combinations. With this code, the input will change as specified in the case statement. The input and output will also be displayed at each change. When the simulation time is 100ns, it will stop. Feel free to play around with the case statement and the conditions to see different behaviors. This is a simple example, and real-world use cases will likely have far more complex conditions and logic. Note that case in Verilog is case sensitive. 

Note: Make sure to replace `4'b0000`, `4'b0100`, etc. with the actual values that you want to correspond to specific inputs and outputs.

You can also use `rand` and `randc` for generating random values during simulation.

You can check the verilog code by opening it in an editor and then save it as a file with a `.sv` extension. You can then run `iverilog` from the terminal to compile the code and then `vvp` to run the compiled code. If you want to use it in a logic synthesis tool, it should be synthesizable but the simulation part might not be applicable.

Also, please note that the NMOSinv module is not provided, you should replace it with
