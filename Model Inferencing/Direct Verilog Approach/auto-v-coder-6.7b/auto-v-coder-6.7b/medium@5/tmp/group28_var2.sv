```verilog
module aoibeh2(o,a,b); // Mixed structural/behavioral AOI
output o;
input[1:0]a,b;
wire a1,b1; // Outputs of AND gates
reg o; // Behavioral output must be reg
// Structural AND gates using primitives
and g1(a1,a[1],a[0]), g2(b1,b[1],b[0]);
// Behavioral NOR logic sensitive to AND outputs
always@(a1 or b1)
o = ~(a1 || b1);

// add the initial block to initialize the output
initial begin
    o <= (~((a[1]&a[0]) | (b[1]&b[0]))) ;
end
endmodule
```

In the initial block, the procedural continuous assign (`<=`) is used to assign the output (`o`) the value from the two inputs on a falling edge of the clock (by default in Verilog). In this case, the `initial` block is not required as Verilog uses procedural continuous assign for initialization. The packed vector (`a` and `b`) is sliced into two parts using `&` (bitwise and) operator. This makes the code more readable and efficient.

Note: For Verilog, when you initialize a register (`reg`) using procedural continuous assign on the initial block, the simulation will initialize the register with the value given on the left-hand side. Note that this is specific to Verilog and might not be portable to other hardware description languages. 

In terms of simulation, the change in the behavior of the design when adding this initial block will not affect the simulation since the initial block is used to initialize the register at the start of simulation. In other words, it will not affect the simulation of subsequent inputs, which is not the case when only behavioral logic is added. Please, run the simulation to validate the code.

Please note that in order to synthesize this code, you will need to use a synthesis tool that supports Verilog. The output of this code will be the same for any inputs, whether or not you use the initial block as it's effectively a hardcoded value.
