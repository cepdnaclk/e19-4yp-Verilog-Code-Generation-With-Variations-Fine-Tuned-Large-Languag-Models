```verilog
module example5(x1, x2, x3, f);
input x1, x2, x3;
output f;
reg f;

wire [5:0] packedArray;
assign packedArray = {x2, x1, x3};

always @(x1 or x2 or x3)
    begin
        if (x2 == 1)
            f = x1;
        else
            f = x3;

        if (packedArray inside {[0:11]})
            begin
                // do something
            end
    end
endmodule
```
In this code, a packed array is created using the part-select of the inputs `{x2, x1, x3}`. Then, an if block is added to check if this packed array lies within the range `[0:11]`. This demonstrates how the Verilog hardware model allows for complex conditions to be added without the need for a separate Verilog testbench. The `inside` operator is used here as a shorthand for a range comparison. If the packed array is within the range, an action such as a comment can be added. Please note that this is a simple example, and it is not recommended to use the `inside` operator like this in a production environment. It's good to understand that this is a part of the Verilog language but in general, the usage of `inside` is restricted to conditions where both the left and right sides are constant ranges. In such cases, a simple range comparison (`<=` and `>=`) is usually sufficient.

In this code, if x2 is one, it will assign value of x1 to f. If x2  is not one, it will assign value of x3 to f. If the packedArray (combining x1, x2, x3) is within the range `[0:11]` it will execute the action within the if block. However, in Verilog for this problem, you would usually use a logic gate or multiplexer to implement a range check. This is just intended to illustrate the use of the `inside` operator and is not meant to be used in a real-world scenario.
