```verilog
module dff(do,di,clk); // Behavioral D Flip-Flop
output do;
input di,clk;
reg do; // Output must be reg for procedural assignment
initial
do=1'b0; // Initialize output
// Assign input 'di' to output 'do' on negative clock edge
always@(negedge clk) do = di; // Use non-blocking <= for sequential logic

wire [1:0] index; // declare a wire for array index
reg [31:0] array[1:0]; // declare an array with 2 elements

initial begin
    index = 1'b0; // set the index
    array[index] = 32'h12345678; // set the value for the array element using the index
end

always@(negedge clk) begin
    case(index) // case statement with array
        1'b0: array[0] <= 32'hABCDEF12;
        1'b1: array[1] <= 32'h98765432;
    endcase
end

endmodule
```

In this modified code, an index is declared as a wire type and initialized to 1'b0. Then, an array of 2 elements is declared with the name array. Next, in the initial block, the value for the first element of the array is set using the index. After that, in the always block, a case statement is used with array operand. The case statement checks the index and executes the corresponding action based on the index value. In this case, if index is 1'b0, it sets the value of array[0] to a known value, and if index is 1'b1, it sets the value of array[1] to another known value. 

Please note that this is a simple example and might not be fully accurate because the array index or case statement conditions are usually defined in the design constraints or some other factors. The modifications required here are dependent on the specific requirements of the design.### If you want to add more complex behavior or cases, you would need to add more conditions and actions within the case statement. Please replace the known values with your actual values. This
