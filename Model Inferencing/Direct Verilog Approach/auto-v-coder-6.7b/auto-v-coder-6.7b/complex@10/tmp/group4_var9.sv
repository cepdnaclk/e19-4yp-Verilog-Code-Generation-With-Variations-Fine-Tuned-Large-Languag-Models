```verilog

wire[3:0]a;
ctr_wt c1(a,clk,N,En);

begin
clk=0; N=4'b1111; // Set limit to 15
En=1'b0; // Start disabled
end

    #10 clk<=~clk;
    #5;
end
generate 
    genvar i;
    for (i=0; i<=10; i=i+1)
    begin : g_ctr_wt_inst
        ctr_wt #(i) inst_ctr_wt (.a(inst_out[i]),.clk(clk),.N(N),.En(En));
    end
endgenerate
endmodule
```
In this code:
- We declare a genvar `i` and initialize it to 0.
- Begin the generate block with a for loop that will go through 0 to 10.
- Declare an instance of the `ctr_wt` module using an unnamed generate block.
- Inside each unnamed generate block, we instantiate `ctr_wt` with an index as the parameter.
- The `#()` syntax is used to generate multiple instances of `ctr_wt` with different indices.
- The `:` colon is used to name each unnamed generate block with a name that is based on the index value.
- Finally, `endgenerate` block is used to close the generate block.

This code will create 11 instances of `ctr_wt` with different indices, and their names will be g_ctr_wt_inst0, g_ctr_wt_inst1, g_ctr_wt_inst2, etc., up to g_ctr_wt_inst10. Each instance of `ctr_wt` will have a different index parameter. This will allow us to simulate the behavior of `ctr_wt` under different conditions, making the code more flexible and versatile.

Remember to use the `$monitor` statement appropriately to match the correct format specifiers in the simulation outputs. Also, make sure
