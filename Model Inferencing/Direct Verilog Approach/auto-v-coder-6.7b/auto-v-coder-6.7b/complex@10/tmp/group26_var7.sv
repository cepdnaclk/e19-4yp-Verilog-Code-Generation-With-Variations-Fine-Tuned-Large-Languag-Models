else if (PLLClock==1'b1)
    HiCount = HiCount + 2'b01;
else begin
    case (HiCount)
        2'b00: Adjr = 2'b11;
        2'b01: Adjr = 2'b01;

```
In this code, the JerkyComparator module takes inputs ClockIn, PLLClock, and Reset, and outputs AdjustFreq. The Adjr register is the variable that is returned as the output. The HiCount register counts the number of high cycles since the last low cycle.

The always block is the sensitivity list, where ClockIn and Reset are included to handle changes in the inputs. The if-else statements handle the Reset and PLLClock inputs. When Reset is true, it resets the Adjr and HiCount to their default states. When PLLClock is true, it increments the HiCount.

The case statement is used to set the Adjr value based on the current HiCount. The HiCount is reset to 0 on every clock cycle. This design is an example of a finite state machine with a counter, where the state is dependent on the counter value.

This Verilog code can be compiled and run in a simulator to verify its functionality. Be sure to include all necessary files, define the interface between testbench and the module, and connect the testbench input signals with your module outputs. Also, ensure your testbench has a clock generator and reset signal set properly.

This code is the base code for a simple module to control frequency adjustment of a PLL
