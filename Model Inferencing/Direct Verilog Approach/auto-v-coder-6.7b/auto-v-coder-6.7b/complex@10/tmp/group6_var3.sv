```verilog
module mux4to1(w0, w1, w2, w3, S, f);
parameter [1:0] ADDR = {2'b00, 2'b01, 2'b10, 2'b11}; // Define a constant-packed array
input w0, w1, w2, w3;
input [1:0] S;
output f;
reg f;
always @(w0 or w1 or w2 or w3 or S)
    if (S inside {ADDR}) begin
        case (S)
            2'b00: f = w0;
            2'b01: f = w1;
            2'b10: f = w2;
            2'b11: f = w3;
        endcase
    end

The inside operator in Verilog compares if a specific value is inside an array. The case statement can be used here to reduce redundant conditions. Please note that the order of elements in the array and the case statement are in the same order. This ensures that `f` is assigned accordingly when `S` is one of the constants. ### This variation improves code readability and flexibility by using the `inside` operator and case statement. It handles all four cases of `S` as one case block and avoids redundant code. A constant-packed array is defined at module scope using the parameter directive, which can be configured according to the specific requirements, making it easier to modify and maintain.f
