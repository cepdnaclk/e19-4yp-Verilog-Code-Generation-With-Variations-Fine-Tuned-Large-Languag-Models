```
In this code, `X` and `Y` are declared as arrays of bits. The `inside` operator checks if a `X` lies in the range `Y`. In this case, it checks if the entire range of `X` is in the range of `Y`. If the range of `X` is a subset of `Y`, `result` will be 1 (`true`), otherwise it will be 0 (`false`). The `inside` operator uses the `in` keyword to check if a specific value, range, or set is a subset of another value, range, or set. This is equivalent to `if (X in Y)` in Python. Please ensure that the widths of X and Y are same for inside operator to work properly.
