```verilog
module test_carry;
reg a, b, c;
integer i;
wire cout;
carry c1(cout, c, a, b);
initial
begin
$monitor("time=%d a=%b b=%b c=%b---------cout=%b", $time, a, b, c, cout);
for (i = 0; i < 9; i = i + 1)
begin
{a, b, c} = i;
end
a = 'bx;
b = 'bx;
end
endmodule
```
The original code is correct and will simulate a carry-out (cout) of a digital design. However, if you specifically want to check the carry-out against a constant array, you can modify the code as follows:

```verilog
module test_carry;
reg a, b, c;
integer i;
wire cout;
carry c1(cout, c, a, b);
integer expected_cout[] = {0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1};
initial
begin
$monitor("time=%d a=%b b=%b c=%b---------cout=%b", $time, a, b, c, cout);
for (i = 0; i < 9; i = i + 1)
begin
{a, b, c} = i;
#1 assert(cout == expected_cout[i]) else $error("Expected cout does not match actual cout at time %d", $time);
end
a = 'bx;
b = 'bx;
end
endmodule
```
This will print an error message if and when the actual carry-out (cout) does not match the expected result in the `expected_cout` array. You would need to replace `expected_cout` with your actual expected results. 

NOTE: `assert` is a Verilog construct that checks a condition and generates an error message if the condition is false. The `$error` is a system task that prints an error message and stops simulating if the error condition is encountered.

This modified code will run the simulation, check the actual cout with
