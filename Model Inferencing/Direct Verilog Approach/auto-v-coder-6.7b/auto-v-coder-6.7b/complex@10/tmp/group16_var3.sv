```verilog
module tb_TOP1;
  reg CLK, RST_X;
  TOP1 uut(.CLK(CLK),.RST_X(RST_X));

  initial begin
    CLK = 0;
    forever #5 CLK = ~CLK;
  end

  initial begin
    RST_X = 0; #10;
    RST_X = 1;
  end
endmodule
```
In the original code, the comparator logic was written to compare `x` against a constant array. This could be updated to use the `inside` operator to compare `x` against a constant array defined in a package.

A package is a collection of parameters, functions, tasks, types, and more. For this purpose, we can define an array of constants inside the package. Following is a basic example:

```verilog
package MyPackage;
  localparam logic [1:0] myArray[4] = '{1'b0, 1'b1, 1'b0, 1'b1};
endpackage

module TOP1(
  input CLK,
  input RST_X
);
  always @(posedge CLK) begin
    if(RST_X) begin
      if(x inside {`MyPackage.myArray}) begin // comparing x against a constant array
        // do something
      end
    end
  end
endmodule
```  
To access the array defined in the package, use the scope resolution operator (`::`). Use the `inside` operator to compare `x` against the array. Note that the `inside` operator is only available with some simulators, so if you are using a different simulator, you will need to adjust the logic.

You should note that this updated example does not create an exact match due to the usage of inside. If you want to match the entire array, consider changing the structure to be either a bit vector or using a for loop `for (int i=0; i<`MyPackage.myArray.size(); i++)`. If you are only looking for a bit vector to match, using the inside operator is more efficient.
