```verilog
module mux4to1(w0, w1, w2, w3, S, f);
input w0, w1, w2, w3;
input [1:0] S;
output f;
reg f;
reg [1:0] sel_arr [0:3];
initial begin
    sel_arr[0] = 2'b00;
    sel_arr[1] = 2'b01;
    sel_arr[2] = 2'b10;
    sel_arr[3] = 2'b11;
end
always @(w0 or w1 or w2 or w3 or S)
    for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++)
        if (S == sel_arr[i])
            f = i == 0? w0 : (i == 1? w1 : (i == 2? w2 : w3));
endmodule
```
In this solution, we created an array of constant-packed vectors at module scope for the possible selections (S should be `2'b00`, `2'b01`, `2'b10`, `2'b11`). Then, we used a `for` loop to iterate through this array and use a `ternary` operator to select the corresponding input (`w0`, `w1`, `w2`, or `w3`) based on the index of the array. The index is used to address the corresponding input (`w0`, `w1`, `w2`, or `w3`). If the index is 0, we choose `w0`, if 1, we choose `w1`, and so on. This modification of the code reduces the `if-else` structure in the original code. The `if` statement has been replaced by a `for` loop that iterates through the array and checks for a match, while the `else if` statements have been replaced with a `ternary` operator. The resulting code is more compact and easier to understand.

Please note that this variation should be used cautiously for small signals and large number of selections, as it increases the combinatorial depth of the design, leading to more complex routing problems. Be mind
