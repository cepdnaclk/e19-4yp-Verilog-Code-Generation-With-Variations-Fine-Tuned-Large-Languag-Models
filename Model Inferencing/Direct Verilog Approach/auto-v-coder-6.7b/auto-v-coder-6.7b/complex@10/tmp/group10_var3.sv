In this modified version of the code, the `inside` operator checks if `s` is `z`, `X`, `0` or `1`. If it is not, then values of `q` and `q_b` are deassigned to prevent them from changing. The same is repeated for the `r` signal in the `force_a_0` block. This prevents them from changing before or while the clock is in a state of `z`, `X`, `0` or `1`.### Note:
This code only checks if `s` and `r` are `z`, `X`, `0` or `1`, not if they are in a valid state to be driven by a logic signal. Hence, we are not checking for a valid state of `z`, `X`, `0` or `1` when logic is applied on `s` and `r`. If we want to check if they are valid logic states, then we will need to add additional checks for `z`, `X`, `0` or `1`.
