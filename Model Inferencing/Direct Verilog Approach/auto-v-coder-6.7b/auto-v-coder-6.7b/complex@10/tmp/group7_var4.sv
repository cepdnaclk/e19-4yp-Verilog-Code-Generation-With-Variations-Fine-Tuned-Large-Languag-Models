```verilog
module alu(s, A, B, F, valid);
input [2:0] s;
input [3:0] A, B;
output [3:0] F;
output reg valid;
reg [3:0] F;

wire [3:0] valid_range = {4'b1110, 4'b0001};

always @(s or A or B)
    case (s)
        0: F = 4'b0000;
        1: F = B - A;
        2: F = A - B;
        3: F = A + B;
        4: F = A ^ B;
        5: F = A | B;
        6: F = A & B;
        7: F = 4'b1111;
    endcase
    
assign valid = (A[3:1] inside {[valid_range]}); // Checks if the most significant bits of A are within the defined range
endmodule
```
In this variation, an extra output `valid` is added to keep track of the validity of the operation. If the most significant bits of A are within the valid_range, then valid will be high, otherwise it will be low. This can be useful for debugging or other purposes. Please note that the `inside` construct is not supported directly by all synthesizers, so use with caution. 

Note: The Verilog `inside` operator is not fully supported in all synthesizers. It's not as straightforward to use, so this case is better suited for more advanced use cases than simple range checking as it's not directly supported by most synthesizers. If you're limited to using basic constructs, you may need to use some more complex logic to achieve the same functionality. This is not recommended for simple cases like this. More complex constructions may have better performance too.
This is a way to use the `inside` construct more widely, but please note that it's not supported in all synthesizers. 

For Verilog, you can use a `case statement` to define a range of numbers. This will check if A falls in any of the ranges defined.
