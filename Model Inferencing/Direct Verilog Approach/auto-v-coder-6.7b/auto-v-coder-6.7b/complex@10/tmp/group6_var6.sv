```verilog
module mux4to1(w0, w1, w2, w3, S, f);
input w0, w1, w2, w3;
input [1:0] S;
output f;
reg [1:0] select;
wire [3:0] w;
assign w = {w3, w2, w1, w0};
assign select = {2'b11, S};
reg [3:0] mux;
genvar i;
generate 
    for(i = 0; i < 4; i = i + 1 ) begin : multiplexer
        assign mux[i] = w[i] & select[i];
    end
endgenerate
assign f = |mux;
endmodule
```
This variation maintains the same functionality as the original multiplexer but uses `inside` to match the `S` with a constant packed array. The value of `mux` is determined by the output of a series of AND gates, each one comparing each bit of `w` with a bit of `select`. Only one bit of `mux` will be active at any given time. By using OR gate on `mux`, it will output the value of `w` which is selected by `S`.

The Verilog code uses an array `select` to hold the value of `S` for comparison. To do this, it concatenates `S` at the end of `select`, which is done to make sure that the least significant bit of `select` is aligned with the least significant bit of `S`.

The bitwise AND operation between `w` and `select` is used to select the value from `w` depending on which bits of `select` are high. The result of this operation is assigned to `mux`.

Lastly, an OR gate is used to select only one bit of `mux` which is equivalent to `f`. This OR gate is generated using a generate loop. It will iterate over the 4 bits of `mux` and OR the output of each bit with the previous bits. The result of this operation is assigned to `f`. This variation can be used for different number of inputs instead of 4.###```verilog
