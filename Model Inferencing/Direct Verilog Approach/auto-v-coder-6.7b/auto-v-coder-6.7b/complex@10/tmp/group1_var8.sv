```verilog
module tst_nor3NMOS();
  reg in1,in2,in3; wire b;
  generate
    genvar i;
    for (i = 0; i < 2; i = i + 1) begin : gen_block1
      nor3NMOS nn(in1,in2,in3,b); // Instantiate NMOS NOR
    end
  endgenerate
  initial begin // Initialize inputs
    in1=1'b0; in2=1'b0; in3=1'b0;
  end
  // Toggle inputs at different rates
  always #2 in1=~in1;
  always #3 in2=~in2;
  always #5 in3=~in3;
  initial $monitor($time, "in1 = %b, in2 = %b, in3 = %b, output = %b ",in1,in2,in3,b); // Removed newline
  initial #24 $stop; // Stop simulation
endmodule
```
In this modified code, I have wrapped the instantiation of the `nor3NMOS` module within a `generate` block and used `for` loop with an escaped name `gen_block1` to instantiate two copies of the NOR gate. This is a simple method of creating multiple copies of the NOR gate, which is useful for testing or simulation purposes. 

Please note that this code might not run directly in a simulator, but it serves as an example of how to generate multiple copies of a module in Verilog.

Also, please ensure to replace `nor3NMOS` with the actual module name you're using.

Remember to adjust the `i` counter according to the number of instances you need. In the original code, it was set to create a single instance of the `nor3NMOS` module. 

Lastly, keep in mind that behavioral Verilog is considered deprecated. It's generally best to use structural Verilog when possible. This code is provided as a tool to showcase how behavioral Verilog works. If you're writing new code, you should use structural Verilog.!
