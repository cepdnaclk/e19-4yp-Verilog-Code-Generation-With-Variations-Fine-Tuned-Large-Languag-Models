In the above code, we are using a simple module JerkyComparator. It calculates the adjustment frequency based on two inputs: ClockIn and PLLClock and Reset. The calculated frequency is then passed into the output AdjustFreq. The reset input Reset is used to reset the module and set the adjustment frequency back to 01. The PLLClock input is used to count the number of high-clock cycles. If it counts to a certain value, it determines the adjustment frequency. 

The code is written in Verilog and represents the base functionality of the module. AdjustFreq is the output frequency that could be 11, 01, or 00, based on the inputs ClockIn and PLLClock. It will be equal to 01 in the beginning, and will change to 11 or 00 based on the count of PLLClock.

This is a basic implementation of a module that monitors the input clock and adjusts the output frequency accordingly. It also includes a reset input to reset the module and adjust the frequency back to its default value. Other conditions or behaviors are not included, and they would need to be added to the module for it to function as desired.
