In this modification, the testbench uses a state register to ensure that the dff is always in one of the three states (0,1, or 1). The input 'di' is used to generate this state transition. The transition follows the rules:
000 -> '1'
001 -> '0'
010 -> '1'
011 -> '1'
100 -> '0'
101 -> '0'
110 -> '0'
111 -> '1'

This ensures that the dff is in a state that matches the async preset.

Please replace the `dffalter` module with the actual DFF module you are using in your design. Also, ensure that the DFF is working correctly as the testbench might not function as expected if the DFF under test is not functioning correctly.

Note: This code will only work with the given constraints of the DFF and the testbench. Without specific constraints, this
