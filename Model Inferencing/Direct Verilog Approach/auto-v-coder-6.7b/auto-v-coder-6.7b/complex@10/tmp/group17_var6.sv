```verilog
module comp
(input wire [N-1:0] x,
input wire [N-1:0] y,
output reg gt, // Greater than
output reg eq, // Equal
output reg lt // Less than
);
always @(*) // Combinational logic
begin
// Default outputs to 0
gt = 1'b0;
eq = 1'b0;
lt = 1'b0;
// Set flags based on comparison results
if(x > y)
gt = 1'b1;
if(x == y)
eq = 1'b1;
if(x < y)
lt = 1'b1;
end
endmodule
```
This code only checks the equality and less than and greater than comparisons between `x` and `y`. Modified code is not necessary based on the provided task. The original logic works as expected for the comparison of two numbers. 

In case, you want to compare more than two numbers or need to find maximum or minimum number amongst them, you might need a more complex logic. 

If you are comparing multiple elements and finding a range of elements, a better way may be to use a comparison operator inside a generate block.

```verilog
module comp #(parameter N=10)
(input wire [N-1:0] x,
input wire [N-1:0] y,
output reg [N-1:0] gt, // Greater than
output reg [N-1:0] eq, // Equal
output reg [N-1:0] lt // Less than
);

generate
    for (i=0; i<N; i++) begin: loop
        always @(*) begin // Combinational logic
            if(x[i] > y[i])
                gt[i] = 1'b1;
            else
                gt[i] = 1'b0;

            if(x[i] == y[i])
                eq[i] = 1'b1;
            else
                eq[i] = 1'b0;

            if(x[i] < y[i])
                lt[i] = 1'b1;
