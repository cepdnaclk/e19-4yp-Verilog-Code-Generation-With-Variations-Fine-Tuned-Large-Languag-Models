```
package test_package;
  const logic [31:0] constant_array [1:0] = '{1, 2};
endpackage

module mixed_sim;
  import test_package::*;
  
  reg dcontrol, x, y;
  reg [31:0] data;
  wire [31:0] bus;
  assign bus = dcontrol? data : 'bz;
  
  always @* begin
    y = ~x;
  end
  
  initial begin
    $monitor("time=%d dcontrol=%d data=%d x=%d y=%d bus=%d",
             $time, dcontrol, data, x, y, bus);
    dcontrol = 0;
    x = 0;
    data = 'd1;
    #5
    x = 1;
    data = 'd2;
    #5;
  end
endmodule
```
This code will display the output of `dcontrol`, `data`, `x`, `y`, and `bus` after every 5 cycles. The condition `dcontrol? data : 'bz` is always true so `bus` will always be assigned as `data`.### Mixing Mealy and Moore Models:

In some cases, it is advantageous to mix Mealy and Moore models in a single Verilog design. For example, you may want to have a sequential part for the state transitions and combinational logic for output. Here is an example of a Verilog code for a mixed Mealy/Moore design:

```
module mixed_mealy_model;

reg [1:0] state; // Moore state
reg output_signal; // Moore output

always @(*) begin
  if (state == 2'b01) begin
    output_signal = 1'b1;
  end else begin
    output_signal = 1'b0;
  end
end

// Sequential part: MoRe states and state transitions
always @(posedge clock) begin
  if (reset) begin
    state <= 2'b00;
  end else begin
    case (state)
      2'b00: begin
