In the solution, there is no external modification required, as the provided Verilog code is already capable of producing the desired behavior. The only thing that could be done is to add a testbench to verify its working condition. This testbench would set appropriate reset, clock in, and pll clock conditions and check if the output AdjustFreq is as expected. 

Please note for the purpose of this example, let's assume that the testbench would include stimuli for all signals, including a reset sequence, and then check if the output AdjustFreq is as expected. The code has been written already to handle reset condition and it is ready to go into the testbench. The changes would be in the testbench to specify the input stimuli and check the output. ### This code is ready for a testbench, but to verify the output behavior in a testing environment, you would require a testbench with a proper stimulus and verifying logic. No external libraries are needed, it is purely Verilog code developed to perform the specified task.### If you want to verify the outputs on a hardware or software simulation, you'll need a simulation tool like ModelSim, Icarus Verilog, or any other similar tool. You can then run the testbench in this tool and see the outputs. The testbench would have to include a sequence to reset,
