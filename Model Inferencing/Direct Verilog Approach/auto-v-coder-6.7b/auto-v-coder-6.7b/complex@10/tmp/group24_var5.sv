The added signal `BCD_in` is connected to `rr.BCD_in` and `BCD_out` is connected to `rr.BCD_out`. You will need to connect it to the correct inputs and outputs in your verilog code.

This way, you can test your design with different inputs and observe the outputs without having to modify your design.

This code will also display BCD input and output as well as PC, IR, and DCOP (not sure what this is, so I left it out). You will need to replace the `mup_opr` and signal connections with your actual RTL design.

Don't forget to update package and constant definitions in your code accordingly.

Please note that the actual functionality of the DUT (i.e., `mup_opr`) is not included in this code and might be very complex or involve multiple
