This code includes a `generate` block to check for `RST_X`, which is set to be active when `RST_X` is not 1. Otherwise, it is set to be inactive. The `generate if (RST_X!== '1')` is a construct used for hardware synthesis to create conditional statements. It is used to generate specific sections of the design based on the value of parameters. It is particularly useful in design verification, especially when dealing with complex testbenches.

Also, the `rst_x` is used to reset the counter state, which is made active when `RST_X` is not 1. If the `RST_X` is 1, the `rst_x` is inactive and the counter will reset back to 0 when reaching the limit. 

Please note that the `RST_X`, `rst_x
