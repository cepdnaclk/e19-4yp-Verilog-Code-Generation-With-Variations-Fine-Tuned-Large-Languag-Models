```verilog
initial begin: Apply_Data /*... Figure 8.11... */
  // Create 2x2 MDA array for operands 1 and 2
  for (indx=0; indx<3; indx++) begin
    // Operands for each clock cycle
    mem1[0] = 8'd1; // Test the LSB of operand 1
    mem1[1] = 8'd1; // Test the MSB of operand 1
    mem1[2] = 8'd1; // Test the LSB of operand 2
    mem1[3] = 8'd1; // Test the MSB of operand 2
  end
end
```
This code uses a generate for loop to populate the MDA array with test data. In this code, `indx` is used to loop over the array with different selection of operands for each clock cycle. Use this to test the LSB and MSB of each operand for every clock cycle.

Remember this code will be run on a single cycle, so only the first cycle of the test is valid. To run this test, make sure to initialize all needed signals in the DUT and start the test. Note that the expected result will be different for every test operation. The expected result was placed after the data is applied. Use the `expected_result` register to store the expected result, and `actual_result` to store the result from the design.

Also, add the `start` signal at the beginning and end of the test to activate the start and hold the done signal, respectively.

This is a simple test to verify if the multiplier works as expected. Please modify the test according to your needs.### Note:
In this code, I used an MDA array to store the data for the operands. You may need to adjust the test if the multiplier you are verifying is using a different data structure. 

Also, while using the MDA array, you need to ensure that the operands are valid, or else the result may not be correctly computed. As per the MDA array selection, make sure to select correct data for every cycle.

Remember to reset the DUT before each test and verify the DUT's reset behavior as well.

Lastly, the actual_result
