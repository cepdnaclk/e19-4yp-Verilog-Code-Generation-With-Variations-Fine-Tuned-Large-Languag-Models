```verilog
module tst_or_gate();
reg[3:0]a;
reg en;
wire b;
or_gate gg(b,a,en);
// test the array slice in OR Gate
wire[1:0] test_a_slice;
assign test_a_slice = a;

initial
begin
a = 4'h0; // Initialize input
en = 1'b0; // Initialize enable
end
initial begin // Stimulus generation
end
initial $monitor("t=%0d, en = %b, a = %h, b = %b, test_a_slice = %b",$time,en,a,b,test_a_slice); // Use %b for binary, %h for hex
initial #30 $stop; // Stop simulation
endmodule
```
Remember that this is a basic change to test the functionality of a simulation. It does not cover all possible configurations but it provides a foundation to extend upon in future designs and simulations. 

This code will also fail to simulate if the `or_gate` module is not defined elsewhere. Remember to define such modules before using them.### 

Also, this code is a simulation code and does not synthesize to actual hardware. It tests for logic values. The actual hardware implementation could differ based on what `or_gate` does. 

The Verilog `or_gate` module could be defined as follows:

```verilog
module or_gate(output reg out, input reg[3:0] a, input reg en);
always @(*) begin
    if (en) begin
        out <= |a;
    end
end
endmodule
```
In this case, `out` will be `1'b1` if at least one bit in `a` is `1'b1` and `en` is `1'b1`. Else, `out` gets the value `1'b0`.### 

The `|a` in the OR gate is a reduction operator in Verilog that performs a logical OR operation on all elements of the array `a`. Thus, `|a` will be `1'b1` if there is at least one `1'b1` in `a`.
