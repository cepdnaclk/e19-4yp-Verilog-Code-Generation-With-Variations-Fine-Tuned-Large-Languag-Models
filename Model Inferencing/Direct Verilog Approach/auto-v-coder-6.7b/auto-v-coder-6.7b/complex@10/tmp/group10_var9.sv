```verilog
module d_ff (input d, clk, s, r, output reg q, q_b );
parameter inside_const = "inside_val"; // example constant

always @( s ) begin : force_a_1
if ( s inside {inside_const} )
begin
end else begin
deassign q;
deassign q_b;
end
end

always @( r ) begin : force_a_0
if( r )
begin
end else begin
deassign q;
deassign q_b;
end
end

always @( posedge clk ) begin : clocked
end
endmodule
```

In this modified code, `inside_const` is declared as a parameter, which can be replaced with any value. The `inside` operator is used in the `force_a_1` block to check if `s` is inside the `inside_const`. If `s` is inside `inside_const`, the logic inside the `if` block will be executed. If not, it will deassign `q` and `q_b`.

Please note that, the `inside` operator only works with Verilog-2005 and later. Verilog-2005 is the first version to introduce the `inside` operator.

Also, this only works in certain compilers. If you're using a compiler that doesn't support the `inside` operator, you would need to replace it with `== inside_const`. However, the latter is not as concise and may not be as straightforward as the `inside` operator.

This example checks if `s` is equal to `inside_const`. Depending on what you are looking for, you might need a different logical operator or different approach.###

Keep in mind that, the `inside` operator and its specific use (in this case, within an always block) might be considered a syntactical construct that was not explicitly allowed by the IEEE 1364-2005 Standard, as it was introduced by the Verilog-2005 standard. This might cause some older tools to not recognize it. It's always worth checking your tool's documentation before implementing anything.joy;
