This Verilog code is a modified version of the same FSM model, where the state transitions are directly used in the `always` block using array slices and `inside` operator. This is a less complex way to write the state transitions as compared to using `case` statement. The code snippet is provided with proper indentation and comments for clarity. ### Important Note: This is a simulation model, not an actual hardware design. It doesn't handle the case when `Resetn` goes high and then comes down without a clock edge. This FSM design would handle such scenario with a simple state transition to `A`. ### Also, note that the outputs of the FSM are assigned based on the inputs and the current state, it behaves like a Moore machine without storing the state. ### The `if (Resetn == 0)` is responsible for resetting the state to `A` when the `Resetn` input goes high. This is a built-in reset mechanism provided by the Verilog language. It's a common technique to reset a machine to a known state when needed. ### All logic is synchronous to the `Clock` edge, meaning it triggers whenever a `Clock` event occurs. This is a synchronous reset, as it resets the state when it sees a `Clock` rising edge. ### The output `z` is directly dependent on the current state and the input `w`, and the next state `Y
