This variation adds a `generate` block that includes a condition controlled by an external package parameter `RST_X`. If `RST_X` is set to 1, the clock generation will occur, otherwise, it will be omitted. Additionally, inside the generate block, the clock generation is now inside an `if` statement checking the `RST_X` value. This structure allows for the clock generation to be controlled by an external parameter. This way, the architecture can be designed without clock generation or with clock generation controlled by an external parameter. 

Note: You need to replace `RST_X` with your actual external parameter that controls the clock generation. If `RST_X` is not defined or set to 1, the clock generation will occur; otherwise, it will be omitted.

Example: `if(RST_X==1)` This line checks if `RST_X` parameter is set to 1, and if so, will include the clock generation in the `generate` block. If `RST_X` is 0, the clock generation will not occur and the clock will not be generated. 

This variation removes the need for a separate testbench for each case of `RST_X`
