This code uses a `for` loop to generate N `always @(*)` blocks to handle each bit of the input signals. The inside operator is used to determine the conditions for greater than, equal, and less than comparison. This code provides more robustness and efficiency than using an `always @(*)` block with a series of `if-else` statements. It also offers better readability and maintainability, especially for large numbers of bits in the input signals. 

Note: You should replace N with the actual number of bits in your input signals.

This code is written in Verilog and assumes that the input signals are unsigned. If the input signals have a different sign representation, you would need to adjust the `gt` and `lt` lines accordingly.

Please make sure to revise the code to meet your specific requirements and test the code on a specific FPGA or ASIC to ensure it works as expected. ###

Also, please note that this Verilog code does not directly synthesize the circuit. To do so, you must use an FPGA or ASIC synthesis tool. The result of synthesizing this code will require a separate code with the specific design intent that is synthesizable by the tool. ###

Lastly, this code does not include error checking mechanisms or sanitation. For actual use, it would be best to add additional logic to handle erroneous or unexpected input values. 

The code here is just a starting point and not a complete solution. Proper error checking and error handling would depend on the actual requirements of the system using this code.
