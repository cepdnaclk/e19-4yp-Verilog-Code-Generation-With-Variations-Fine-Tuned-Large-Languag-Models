This code defines a module `TOP1` with an output `x_o` and an internal register `x`. It uses a constant array inside a package to define the values to compare against. Inside the always block, it checks if `x` is inside the array and if it is, it updates `x_o` with the value of `x`, otherwise it resets `x_o` to zero. The `x_o` output is a register where the comparison result is stored.

The testbench `tb_TOP1` is also modified to include the `TOP1` module and an initial block that sets the reset signal and a clock signal. 

The clock signal is generated in a separate initial block. The reset signal is set to 0, then 1 after a certain delay. The x signal is then modified outside of the reset condition to test the inside operator.
