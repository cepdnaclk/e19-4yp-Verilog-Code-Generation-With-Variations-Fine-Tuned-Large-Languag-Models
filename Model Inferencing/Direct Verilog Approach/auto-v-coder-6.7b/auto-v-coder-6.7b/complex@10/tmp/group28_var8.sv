```verilog
module tstdlatch; //test-bench
reg d,en;
wire q,qb;
// dlatch ff(en,d,q,qb); // Assuming instantiation of a D latch module
initial
begin
d = 1'b0;
en = 1'b0; // Latch disabled
end
always #4 en =~en; // Enable toggles every 4 time units
always #8 d=~d; // Data toggles every 8 time units
initial $monitor($time," en = %b, d = %b, q = %b, qb = %b ", en,d,q,qb);

Please replace `flush_P0_P1` transition with `inside` check of `state` against a packed range defined in the package scope. Here's how:

```verilog
always @(*)
begin
  if(inside({state1, state2, state3}, {state_p0, state_p1})) begin
    // Perform your operations here
  end
end
```

Please adjust the value of `state_p0` and `state_p1` to match your exact requirements.

Please note that this is a placeholder code and the actual implementation could vary based on the specific package and design you are using. This is just a guide to adapt the given code to your case. As always, it is best to thoroughly test the modified code to ensure it behaves as expected. 

If you want to replace `flush_P0_P1` transition with `inside` check, you need to replace `flush_P0_P1` with `inside(state, {state_p0, state_p1})`. Be sure to adjust `state_p0` and `state_p1` to match the state values that you want to compare with the `state` inside the `if` statement. 

In the given condition, inside will return true when `state` is within the range of `state_p0` to `state_p1`, inclusive. If you are comparing with two states (state_p0 and state_p1), the state range should be a packed array
