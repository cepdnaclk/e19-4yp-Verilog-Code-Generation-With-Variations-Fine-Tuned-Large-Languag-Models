    C[0] = carryin;
    for (k = 0; k <= n-1; k = k + 1)
    begin
        S[k] = X[k] ^ Y[k] ^ C[k];
        C[k+1] = (X[k] & Y[k]) | (C[k] & X[k]) | (C[k] & Y[k]);

```
In the above code, we have used the parameter `n` to define the size of inputs `X` and `Y`. The module `addern` takes four inputs `carryin`, `X`, `Y`, and produces two outputs `S` and `carryout`. It computes the one's complement addition of inputs `X` and `Y` with a carry input `carryin` and places the result in `S`. The carryout is also produced as the last bit of the sum. The size of the sum `S` equals the size of the inputs `X` and `Y`.
The above code utilizes simple for loops for bit operations and is written in Verilog. It uses a sequential block and the `always` statement to constantly check for changes to the input signals and execute the statements inside the block whenever these signals change.

This code is written in Verilog and it should be synthesized to generate RTL (Register Transfer Level) design. The synthesized design should be simulated with a testbench to verify its functionality.
