```verilog
module tst_or_gate();
reg[3:0]a;
reg en;
wire b;
or_gate gg(b,a,en);
initial
begin
a = 4'h0; // Initialize input
en = 1'b0; // Initialize enable
end

initial begin
  for (int i=0; i<256; ++i) begin 
    a = $random();
    en = $random();
    #1;
  end
end

initial $monitor("t=%0d, en = %b, a = %h, b = %b",$time,en,a,b);
initial #30 $stop;
endmodule
```
In the above modified code, an infinite loop is added in the `initial` block which will continuously assign random values to `a` and `en` and every time that a new value is assigned, the monitor outputs the current simulation state. The loop continues until the simulation reaches 30 time units, at which point the simulation is stopped.### Note:
The task of generating a pseudo-random bit sequence is handled by Verilog's built-in function `$random()`. This function returns a pseudo-random bit sequence of given length. The `inside` check has been removed as it is out of scope of this question. Please test it in your environment.### Please note that this code is a minimalistic example and may need further modifications depending on your specific use-case. The purpose of the code is to demonstrate how to use Verilog to test a design.### For this code to work, you need to define the behavior of the or gate and assign it to the input and `en`. Since we didn't define `or_gate`, its behavior here is undefined. So, this code will not produce any outputs.

Also, keep in mind that Verilog is not a hardware description language. It is mainly used for hardware simulation and verification. The actual hardware design logic needs to be handled by a hardware description language like VHDL. 

Finally, note that this code may not be synthesizable as hardware. Running this code might not generate any hardware output, but it serves as a good example of using Verilog to emulate a hardware design. If you want to use it for synthesis,
