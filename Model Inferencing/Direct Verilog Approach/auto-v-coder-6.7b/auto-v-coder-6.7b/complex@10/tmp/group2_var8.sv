```verilog
initial begin: Apply_Data
  for (indx = 0; indx < 3; indx++) begin
    @(negedge clk);
    opnd1 = mem1[indx];
    @(negedge clk);
    opnd2 = mem2[indx];
    @(posedge clk);
    expected_result = {1'b0, opnd1} * {1'b0, opnd2};
    multiplier_result = {lsb_out, msb_out};
  end
end
```
This modified code block will drive data from `mem1` and `mem2` and then calculate the expected result for each pair of operands. The expected result is calculated by bit shifting the operands and performing a bitwise multiplication. After the expected result is calculated, it will be compared with the actual result (LSB and MSB outputs of the multiplier) in the `Compare_Results` block.
Note: The generated tb_test_multiplier module will include the generated code and the initial block `Apply_Data` will perform the required test operations on the generated memory arrays. 

Also, note that the current design doesn't include the instantiation of multiplier or the memory arrays. The above code is a demonstration of how to perform the operations and comparison while using memory arrays. These details can be added as per your requirement.! 

This code is designed to be used in a testbench to test the Multiplier module. It assumes that the `Multiplier` module has been instantiated with the names `clk`, `start`, `databus`, `lsb_out`, `msb_out`, `done`. The module will use these signals as per the specific design requirements. 

The code also assumes that the `opnd1` and `opnd2` signals are used for the operands, and that the `start` signal is used to start the operation. The expected result is provided as `expected_result`, which is calculated by shifting the operands and performing a bitwise multiplication. The actual result is calculated by combining the outputs of the LSB and MSB outputs of the multiplier and is compared with the expected result in the `Compare_Results` block
