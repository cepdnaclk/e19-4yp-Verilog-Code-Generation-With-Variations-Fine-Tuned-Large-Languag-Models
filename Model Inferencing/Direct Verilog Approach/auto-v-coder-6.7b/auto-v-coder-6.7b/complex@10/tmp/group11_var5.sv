```

In this code, a generate block is used to instantiate the design under test (DUT) in the same test file and generate the different stimuli for the `s` signal inside the `s: begin: g_s` block. The `inside` keyword is used to generate different combinations for the `s` signal at different times. This allows testing the tristate multiplexer with both high and low values of the `s` signal.

The `ttst_ttrimux2_1` is the name of the Verilog module (the design under test) that contains the tristate multiplexer. The `dut()` function calls the instantiation of this module.

Note: This code is a generic example and assumes that you have instantiated the design under test correctly. Please replace `ttst_ttrimux2_1` with the name of your module. Also, ensure that your tristate multiplexer has the correct inputs and outputs, as the instantiation line `ttrimux2_1 mm(out,e,i,s);` is also assumed to be correct.

Also, make sure
