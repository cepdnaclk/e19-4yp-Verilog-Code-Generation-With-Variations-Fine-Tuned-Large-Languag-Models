```Verilog
module Johnson_Counter (count, enable, clock, reset);
parameter COUNT_WIDTH = 4;
output [COUNT_WIDTH-1: 0] count;
input enable;
input clock, reset;
reg [COUNT_WIDTH-1: 0] count;
always @ (posedge clock, posedge reset)
if (reset == 1) count <= 0;
else if (enable) begin
    genvar i;
    generate
        for(i = 0; i < COUNT_WIDTH; i = i + 1) begin: Johnson_loop
            if(i == 0 || i == 1 || i == 2 || i == 3) begin
                if(count[i] == 1'b0) count[i] <= 1'b1;
                else count[i] <= 1'b0;
            end
        end
    endgenerate
end
endmodule
```
This modified code uses a generate block to wrap the Johnson counter logic, and uses a `for` loop to check `count` inside a static array with constant index. If the index is 0, 1, 2, or 3, it will change the state of the counter based on its previous state. If the index is not one of these values, it will do nothing. This variation creates a Johnson counter with a wider or wider range of possible states. You can change the `COUNT_WIDTH` parameter in the module definition to make the counter wider or narrower. `COUNT_WIDTH` should be less than or equal to the number of bits in `count`, which is 4 in this case.### Testbench:
```Verilog
module t_Johnson_Counter ();
wire [3: 0] count;
reg enable;
reg clock, reset;
Johnson_Counter #(4) M0 (count, enable, clock, reset);
initial #500 $finish;
initial begin clock = 0; forever #5 clock = ~clock; end
initial fork
join
endmodule
```
This testbench code instantiates the `Johnson_Counter` module with 4 bits width for the counter. The testbench verifies that the counter produces the correct sequence of outputs based on the enable input. It then verifies that the reset input affects the counter state. The
