This modified code will create a Johnson counter with four instances by using a generate block with a for loop. Inside the `generate` block, each Johnson counter will be implemented with a different logic to ensure different count output. The `genvar` is used to create a loop control variable, and `i = 0` to start the loop. The loop runs until `i` reaches 3, incrementing by 1 each time.
The Johnson counter logic is the same as the original code, except for the `count` is statically assigned to different values for each counter to ensure each counter has its unique state.

Please note that this is a simple example. In a real-world scenario, you may have multiple counters with different logic, and you will need to
