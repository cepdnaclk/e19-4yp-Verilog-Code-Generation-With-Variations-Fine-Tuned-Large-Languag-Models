In this added code snippet, `X` and `Y` are declared as 4-bit arrays. And inside specifies a packed slice. It will return 1 if the result `Z` of X is inside Y's range else 0. Please modify the code as needed for the actual application. This is used for checking the bit coverage of the circuit design.### Note:

The `inside` keyword in Verilog is not supported in all simulators or synthesis tools, and its behavior may vary, particularly in certain corner cases. Be especially aware of your chosen tool when using it. This is just a note to keep it in mind. It's also possible that other versions of Verilog (like SystemVerilog) support this keyword, so it's a good idea to check your specific tool's manual to find out its exact support level.

In this code, X and Y are declared as arrays in order to ensure that the `inside` keyword works as intended. However, since the `ins
