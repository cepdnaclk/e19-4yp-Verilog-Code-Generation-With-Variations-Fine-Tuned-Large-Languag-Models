            #1 $display("Start of iteration %d", i);
            dcontrol = 0;
            data = my_data[i];

```
This Verilog model displays the message "Start of iteration %d" and "End of iteration %d" every time the `dcontrol` is toggled from 0 to 1. It then iterates over the contents of `my_data` array in `my_package`, changing `data` every time and displaying it along with the `dcontrol` value. The model then finishes at the end of the last iteration.

This is a simple program that demonstrates the use of a package to store a constant array in Verilog, and how to use this array in a Verilog model. Please note that, for the successful testing and simulation of this model, please ensure that your simulator supports `$finish` command.

Also, please modify the simulation time and delay accordingly according to your simulation tools. The `#1` commands are used to wait for one time unit in simulation time. This is just a placeholder and it may vary depending on your simulation tool.

Finally, this model does not provide any debugging output for the Verilog code. To view the debugging output, you should add `$monitor` statements in your
