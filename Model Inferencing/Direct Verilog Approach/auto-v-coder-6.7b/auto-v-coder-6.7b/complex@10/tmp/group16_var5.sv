In the solution, the use of `inside` operator has been added to compare the value of `x` against the constant array defined in a module.

Please replace `x` with the actual signal you are comparing against the constant array. This code uses the `inside` operator to check if the value `x` is inside the `data` constant array. If true, it displays `x is inside data`. If false, it displays `x is not inside data`.### Note:

This code is a simple modification of the original code. Please replace `x`, `data` and `RST_X` with actual signal names and array elements. Also, keep in mind that inside is not directly supported by all Verilog compilers. If you are using Icarus Verilog, or any other simulator that does not support the inside operator, you may need to add a separate logic to check if
