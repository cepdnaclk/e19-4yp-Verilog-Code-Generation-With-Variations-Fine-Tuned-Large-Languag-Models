```verilog
module alu(s, A, B, F);
input [2:0] s;
input [3:0] A, B;
output [3:0] F;
reg [3:0] F;
reg [3:0] A_inside;
always @(s or A or B)
    begin
        A_inside = A[2:0];
        if(A_inside == 3'b110) begin
            F = 4'b1111;
        end else begin
            case (s)
            0: F = 4'b0000;
            1: F = B - A;
            2: F = A - B;
            3: F = A + B;
            4: F = A ^ B;
            5: F = A | B;
            6: F = A & B;
            7: F = 4'b1111;
            endcase
        end
    end
endmodule
```
In this modified code, a temporary register `A_inside` is introduced to store the result of slicing `A`. If `A_inside` value is `3'b110` then F is set to all 4'b1111, otherwise, according to input signal `s`, appropriate F value is computed.

This variation demonstrates the use of part select on A and checks the condition when the value of A is defined. If such condition is met, F is set to all 1's, else it follows the alu operation.

Please note that this is a variation instruction, so you need to modify the code according to your requirements. This instruction may vary depending on your specific requirements. ### Testbench:

```verilog
module alu_tb();
reg [2:0] s;
reg [3:0] A, B;
wire [3:0] F;

alu DUT(.s(s),.A(A),.B(B),.F(F));

initial begin
    A = 4'b0000; B = 4'b0001; s = 0; #10;
    A = 4'b0001;
