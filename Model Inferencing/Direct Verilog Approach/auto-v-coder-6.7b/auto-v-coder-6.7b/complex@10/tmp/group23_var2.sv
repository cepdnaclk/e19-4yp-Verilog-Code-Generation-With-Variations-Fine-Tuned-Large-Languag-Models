This modification verifies that the internal register `rr.ir` is within the defined constant array, and if not, it loads 0 into the Q-register. It ensures that the internal register `rr.ir` is inside the defined constant array. 

This code can be added to an existing Verilog design to verify the presence of an internal register `rr.ir`. It is a common practice in Test Bench Design to verify the code functionaliy.

Please note that this variation assumes that the internal register `rr.ir` is directly connected to the `int_q` variable. If the internal register is connected through other intermediate variables or registers, the modification would need to be adjusted accordingly. 

Also, this variation is designed to work with specific constant values, and may need adjustments based on the specific design and usage. Please replace the constant values with the actual values that you are working with.

Please ensure that the constant array covers all possible values of the internal registers to accurately validate the functionality of your design. It may not be applicable for all cases, particularly when the internal register has other possibilities besides the ones defined in the array.
