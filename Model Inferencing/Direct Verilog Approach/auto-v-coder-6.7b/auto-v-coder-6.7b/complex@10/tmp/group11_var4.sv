```Verilog
module ttst_ttrimux2_1(); // Assuming this tests a tristate 2-to-1 mux called ttrimux2_1
reg e;
reg [1:0]i; // Should be reg i0, i1; or reg [0:0] i0, i1; or just input wires if MUX takes separate inputs
reg s;
wire out; // Added wire declaration
// ttrimux2_1 mm(out,e,i,s); // Instantiation requires correct MUX definition
initial
begin
e =0; i = 2'b00; s = 1'b0; // Added initial's' value
end
always
begin
end
initial $monitor($time," enable e = %b, s= %b, input i = %b,output out = %b ",e,s,i,out);
initial #48 $stop;
endmodule
```

The complete design and functionality should be implemented by the user based on the specifics of the tristate multiplexer being tested. The above code serves as a basic template for the user to define and test the multiplexer.

The tristate multiplexer is a design that gives high-impedance (Z) between the mux output and the power supply when the select signal (s) is not asserted, and delivers the selected input signal (i0 or i1) to the output when s is high. The select signal is asserted by the multiplexer controller, which is not present in the above code.

The code can be further modified to include logic to control the testing of the multiplexer and to generate test cases. 

The user should incorporate specific tristate 2-to-1 multiplexer's definition, including the instantiations and wiring statements. 

A `$monitor` statement is used to view the output of the multiplexer after the tests. However, remember to remove or comment the `$monitor` statement when the final design is ready. ### Useful Links:
