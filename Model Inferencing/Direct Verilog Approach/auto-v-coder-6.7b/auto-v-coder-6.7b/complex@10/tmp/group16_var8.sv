```verilog
module tb_TOP1;
  reg CLK, RST_X;
  TOP1 uut(.CLK(CLK),.RST_X(RST_X));

  initial begin
    CLK = 0;
    forever #5 CLK = ~CLK;
  end

  initial begin
    RST_X = 0; #10;
    RST_X = 1;
  end

The modified code is the same as the provided base code because the comparator logic has been modified to use `inside` operator to compare `x` against a constant array defined in a package. 

The original code is provided in the question, and the modified code is shown as well. The only difference is that the `inside` operator is used to compare `x` against a constant array defined in a package.
