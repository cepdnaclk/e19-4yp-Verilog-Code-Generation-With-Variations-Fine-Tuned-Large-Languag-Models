This code adds a generate block to check whether a bit in the internal register `int_q` is high or low. If the bit is high, an error signal is raised. This is just a placeholder and doesn't represent any meaningful functionality. The actual usage will depend on the specific conditions under which you want to check the values of `int_q`.

Note: You should replace the `"defines.vh"` with your actual file name where you define your constants and typedefs. Also, the code assumes the use of `defines.vh` file and its content. This code is written based on your provided information and does not represent a complete system. It might need modifications based on your actual use case.
