In the modified code, `A_inside` is a wire that contains the first two bits of operand A. This is then used as an indexed part select on operand B and the `if` statement checks if it is inside the defined constant range {[0:1]}. If it is, the result is assigned as `F = B - A`, otherwise it is assigned as `F = B - 2'b11`. This is a demonstration of a more complex condition in the case statement. ### Note:
The code provided is a bit simplistic and does not handle edge cases properly. For example, if `A_inside` is outside the defined constant range {[0:1]}, the code will still assign `F = B - 2'b11`, which may not be the desired behavior in a real-world scenario. In a real-world scenario, you would want to handle this edge case separately or have an error signal. This code is given to give an idea of how to build on the basic ALU example. It is recommended to test this code in a different platform where you can verify the function of the code.

Also note that for the given range 0:1, the most significant bit of `F` will be a don't care or a constant. This is
