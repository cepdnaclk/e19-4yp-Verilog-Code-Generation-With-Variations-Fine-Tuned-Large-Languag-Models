### Note:
This code creates 4 input NMOS NOR gates, which are designed to work with a 4-bit bus. It's designed to work with 1-bit-wide signals (as in your original case) but it's also designed to work with 4-bit wide signals (like in the modified code). Hence, the modified code can handle 4 different inputs for the NMOS NOR gate.
Please replace `nor3NMOS` with your actual NMOS NOR gate module and make necessary changes if it uses different parameters. Also, ensure that your inputs are at least 4 bits wide. ### Modify your code to suit your specific needs. ### This code is for a system verilog environment. For use in other environments, appropriate syntax adjustments may be needed. ### Simulation is done in non-blocking assignments (~=). Be careful when simulating with blocking assignments (=) as they may lead to non-deterministic or undefined behavior. This is an aspect that needs to be considered in a real-life scenario.
