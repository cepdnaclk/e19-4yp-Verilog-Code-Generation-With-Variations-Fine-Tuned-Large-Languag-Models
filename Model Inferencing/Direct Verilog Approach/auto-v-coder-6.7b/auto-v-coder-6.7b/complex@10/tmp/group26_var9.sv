In this modified code, `INITIAL_VAL`, `COUNT_INITIAL_VAL`, `RANGE_VAL_1`, `RANGE_VAL_2`, `VALUE_1`, `VALUE_2`, and `VALUE_3` are placeholders for your actual parameters. Replace them with their appropriate values. 

This code should be run in a test bench environment to verify the function of the JerkyComparator module. The test bench should contain the necessary inputs and outputs and also check the outputs against the expected results.

Please note that the parameters should be constants or parameters defined in your test bench environment. They cannot be values directly entered in the module as they aren't static values.

Keep in mind that this code is not synthesizable as it uses non-standard Verilog constructs. If you are using a Verilog simulator, you may need to adjust the syntax to fit the specific simulator you are using. The code you provided is likely synthesizable, but it may need tweaking based on the actual Verilog simulator you are using.### For any further inquiry please contact me through the platform. ###```verilog
