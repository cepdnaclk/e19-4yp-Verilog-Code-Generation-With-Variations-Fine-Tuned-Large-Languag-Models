```verilog
`include "package.sv" // assuming package.sv stores constants for comparison

module TOP1 (input CLK, RST_X,
             input [7:0] x,
             output reg [3:0] z);

  always @(posedge CLK) begin
    if(RST_X == 0) begin
      z <= 0;
    end else if(x inside {constants}) begin
      z <= 1;
    end else begin
      z <= 2;
    end
  end
endmodule

`include "tb_TOP1.sv"
```
In the design of `TOP1` module, a `if/else` structure is used to check if the input `x` falls inside the `constants` defined in the package. This requires including `package.sv` which should define the `constants`. The module then sets output `z` to `1` if `x` falls inside `constants`, `2` otherwise. The testbench `tb_TOP1.sv` remains the same and is included at the end of the design.

Please note that `constants` are defined in the package `package.sv`. The package contains:
```verilog
package constants;
  parameter const1 = 8'd1;
  parameter const2 = 8'd2;
  // more constants
endpackage
```
This way, we have encapsulated `constants` in a package which can be easily used in all the verilog files that include this package.

This variation of code uses the `inside` operator to simplify the comparison of `x` against a constant array. This is done by including the package and using the `constants` defined in it in the `TOP1` module.

This design can be easily extended with new constants by adding them to the `constants` list in the package. In this case, the `TOP1` module uses the `constants` array to decide its output based on the input `x`.

The only downside is that the `constants` array must be known beforehand, so if the `constants` are generated or fetched dynamically, then this design may not be suitable. However, in these scenarios, other methods such as comparison with
