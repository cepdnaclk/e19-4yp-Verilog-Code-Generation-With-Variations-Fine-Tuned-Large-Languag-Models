```verilog
module tst_or_gate();
reg[3:0]a;
reg en;
wire b;
or_gate gg(b,a,en);
initial
begin
a = 4'h0; // Initialize input
en = 1'b0; // Initialize enable
end
initial begin // Stimulus generation
$display("Testing OR gate with array slices");
end
always begin
   #10 a = $urandom_range(0,15);
end
initial $monitor("t=%0d, en = %b, a = %h, b = %b",$time,en,a,b); // Use %h for hex 'a'
initial #30 $stop; // Stop simulation
endmodule
```
In this code, `$urandom_range(0,15)` generates random numbers in the range of `0-15`. The random numbers are assigned to `a` at every positive edge of the clock (every 10 time units). This is a simulation process to test array slices in range lists.

However, keep in mind that arrays and slices in Verilog do not behave as expected in a deterministic finite state machine (DFSM) simulation. The values of arrays and slices in Verilog do not change when their contents are manipulated within an always block or an initial block. This is due to the limitations of verilog in DFSM (Deterministic Finite State Machine) simulations.

In real hardware, changing the value of array slices can be done, but in Verilog, it is not. As a result, the simulation results may not reflect the actual behavior of the design. Formal verification tools or other simulation environments should be used to accurately simulate the array slices.

For this example, this is a basic simulation to show how array slices are used with their own simulation process. This should not be used as a guide to the actual hardware implementation.

Remember to replace the `or_gate` module with your actual design. Also, verify if your target hardware has the corresponding array slices on the actual hardware.#### Note:
This variation code does not directly affect the `or_gate` module's output `b`. It only changes the input `a` to a random value every 10 time units. You would
