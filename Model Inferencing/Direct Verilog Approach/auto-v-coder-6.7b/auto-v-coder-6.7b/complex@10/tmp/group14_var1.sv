```verilog
`define INDEX(x) ((x) & 1'b1)
module hex7seg_le (
input wire [3:0] x,
output wire [6:0] a_to_g // Outputs for segments a,b,c,d,e,f,g
);
genvar i;
generate for (i=0; i<4; i++) begin : seg_gen
    assign a_to_g[6-i] = (`INDEX(x[3-i]))? 1'b1 : 1'bz; // a (segment index 6)
end endgenerate
endmodule
```
Note: The generate block is used to loop through each of the four bits of the input `x`, and the code inside is written such that it sets one of the segments to logic high (`1'b1`) if the corresponding bit of `x` is set to 1 (`1'b1`), and `1'bz` otherwise. This way, we can generate all the logic equations for all the segments. The `endgenerate` block ends the generation. 

The `inside` check, where we use an indexed part select (`x[3-i]`) to check if the i-th bit of input `x` is set, is used to generate the logic equations for the segments. Inside the loop, we set the segment to `1'b1` if the bit is set, and to `1'bz` otherwise.

The output signal `a_to_g` is used to control the LED segments of the seven-segment display. The index of the segment corresponds to the output index (ex. `a_to_g[6]` corresponds to segment `a`).

The `1'bz` means that the corresponding segment is tri-state, meaning it is not driven by the design and the LED is left unlit (represented by a hyphen `-`). This is because we do not connect this segment in the design.

The `1'b1` means that the corresponding segment is driven by the design and the LED is lit (represented by a dot `.`). This is because we connect this segment in the design.

The `1'bz` and `
