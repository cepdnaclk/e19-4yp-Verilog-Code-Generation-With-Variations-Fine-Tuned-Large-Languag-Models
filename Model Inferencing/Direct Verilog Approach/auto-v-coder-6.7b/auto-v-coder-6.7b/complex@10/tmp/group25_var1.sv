module comparator (i_in, o_out);

wire [3:0] HiCount;

end
endmodule
```
In this modified code, the `AdjrPackage` is a package that holds the array `Adjr`, which is the array of possible values that we need to compare the `HiCount` with. The `inside` operator is used to check if `HiCount` is inside the `Adjr` array. If it is, `o_out` is assigned a `0`, otherwise it is assigned a `1`. The `assign` statement for `Adjr` is made `wire` so that the combinational logic can still operate correctly.

The `comparator` module is a simplified version of a comparator designed to check if the `HiCount` is in the `Adjr` array. The `always` block is used to handle the combinational logic that checks if `HiCount` is within 4 values in the `Adjr` array.

Please note that this modified code assumes that you have created the `comparator` module correctly and linked it correctly with your test bench.

Also, you need to understand that the `Adjr` array should be set to be the exact values you want to compare `HiCount` with. If you want the `HiCount` to be compared with different values, you should adjust the `Adjr` array accordingly. 

Also, note that the `Comparator` module can only handle the `HiCount` that is a Binary Coded Decimal (
