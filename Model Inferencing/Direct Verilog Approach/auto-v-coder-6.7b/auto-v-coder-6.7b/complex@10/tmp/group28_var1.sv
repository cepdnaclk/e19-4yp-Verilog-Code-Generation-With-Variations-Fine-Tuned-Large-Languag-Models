In this code, we have added a parameterized package-based state machine that cycles through different states whenever the `en` signal toggles. This is done through a case statement which checks the `state` against the predefined parameters `P0`, `P1`, `P2` and `P3`. Upon each `en` signal, the `state` is updated accordingly. The `initial $monitor` statement will print out the current values of `en`, `d`, `q`, `qb` and `state` every time the simulation environment changes these values. The simulation is stopped after 40 time units.

Note: This code assumes that the D latch module is instantiated with the same module name "dlatch". If the module name is different, the instantiation of the module will have to be changed accordingly. The state machine mentioned in the code can be adjusted to fit the actual D latch's behavior as per the simulation
