```verilog
module tstdlatch;
reg d,en;
wire q,qb;
// dlatch ff(en,d,q,qb); // Assuming instantiation of a D latch module
initial
begin
d = 1'b0;
en = 1'b0; // Latch disabled
end
// Enable toggles every 4 time units
always #4 en =~en; 
// Data toggles every 8 time units
always #8 d=~d; 
initial $monitor($time," en = %b, d = %b, q = %b, qb = %b ", en,d,q,qb);
initial #40 $stop;
endmodule
```
This original code has not been modified as it does not include any substantial variations compared to what was meant. However, if you wanted to ensure that the enable signal was only set to 1 when the state was inside a particular defined range, you could modify the enable signal inside a range check. Here's an example:

```verilog
module tstdlatch;
reg d,en;
wire q,qb;
reg [3:0] state;
// dlatch ff(en,d,q,qb); // Assuming instantiation of a D latch module
initial
begin
d = 1'b0;
en = 1'b0; // Latch disabled
state = 4'b0;
end
// Enable toggles every 4 time units
always #4 begin
state = state + 1;
if (state inside {[3:7]})
en = ~en;
end
// Data toggles every 8 time units
always #8 d=~d; 
initial $monitor($time," en = %b, d = %b, q = %b, qb = %b, state = %b ", en,d,q,qb,state);
initial #40 $stop;
endmodule
```

This modification simply introduces a variable `state` and sets the `en` signal to 1 only when the state is within a range of 3 to 7. Again, the original code has not been changed. The modified part is only added for an extra demonstration.
