```verilog
module dffalter_tst(); // Testbench, likely for a DFF named dffalter
reg di,clk,clr,pr;
wire q, qb; // Added qb
// dffalter dff(q,qb,di,clk,clr,pr); // Assumed instantiation of DUT
initial
begin
clr=1'b1;pr=1'b0;clk=1'b0;di=1'b0; // Start with clear asserted
end
always
begin
clr=1'b0; // Deassert clear
end
always # 4 di =~di; // Toggle data
always #16 pr=1'b1; // Assert preset
always #20 pr =1'b0; // Deassert preset
initial begin
    $monitor("t=%0d, clk=%b, clr=%b, pr=%b, di=%b, q=%b, qb=%b ", $time,clk,clr,pr,di,q, qb);
    $monitor("t=%0d, di=%b, q=%b, qb=%b ", $time,di,q, qb);
end
initial #46 $stop; // Stop simulation
endmodule
```
This code now introduces async preset behavior by changing the `pr` signal from low to high after 16 time units. After 20 time units, the `pr` signal is set back to low. As a result, the `q` output will be asynchronous, as it doesn't wait for the preset signal and immediately transitions to its value. The `qb` output also behaves the same way.

This is a simple simulation that can validate the async preset behavior of a DFF. In a real design, you would need to modify the Verilog code to include the DFFalter module and hook up test signal inputs to the DFF.

Note: In real-world implementation, don't forget to instantiate your DFF with the same module name and connect the D-flip flop inputs to your module's inputs. 

Also, the above code does not work in Modelsim, as it does
