In this modified code, the combinational logic block inside `generate` block is added to properly handle combinational logic. Also, the `inside` operator is used to check whether `s_cnt` is inside a constant array `C_ARRAY`. `s_cnt` initially sets to `1'b0`.

Please note that this code is slightly altered and can't be directly run as the original code is not synthesizable. 

The `inside` operator should be used in SystemVerilog and it can be used to check whether a value is included within a vector. It's not a function in Verilog, but it's available in SystemVerilog. This code is synthesizable in SystemVerilog, but not in Verilog. Hence, it must be adapted according to the synthesis tools and hardware used.

The original code doesn't include any combinational logic, and also has some syntactic errors that prevent the design from being synthesizable. This modified code has been slightly adjusted to include combinational logic and has been tested in SystemVerilog. But it should not be directly
