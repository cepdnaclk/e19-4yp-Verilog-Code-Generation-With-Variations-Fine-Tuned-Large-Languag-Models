The delay added in the testbench code `#30` is to observe the counter operation and `#70` is to allow sufficient time for the counter to reach its limit. The variable `En` is used to control the enable of the counter. We are enabling it for `#10`, counting for `#30` and disabling it for `#40`. The simulator will stop after `#70`. This code uses `#` delay operator to introduce a delay before changing the `En` signal. This allows us to observe the counter behavior in several different states. Please modify the timing as needed for your own simulation setup. 

Please note that the counter can be enabled or disabled at any time. To avoid confusion, if the counter is enabled, the count is started and continues until it reaches the maximum value as set by `N`. Then, it stops and waits for further instructions. This behavior is consistent with the specification. If the counter is not enabled (`En = 0`), it stops and waits for further instructions. In this instantiation, the counter is always enabled, thus it counts.

This is just one way of controlling the counter. You can modify the testbench code to observe the behavior of the counter in various states by using `#` and modifying `En`. This is a basic demonstration of a counter's behavior.

The `ctr_wt` module is assumed to have its own testbench, which
