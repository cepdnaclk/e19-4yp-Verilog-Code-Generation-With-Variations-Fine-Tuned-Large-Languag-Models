if (int_q inside {2, 5, 7, 10}) begin

end

```
In the modified code, the `generate` block is used to check if the internal register `rr.ir` contains any of the values 2, 5, 7, or 10. If it does, the array `'{4'h3, 4'h4, 4'h5, 4'h6, 4'h7, 4'h8, 4'h9}` is assigned to the `rr.ir` internal register. If the condition is not met, the `rr.ir` register remains the same. This variation is not a standard Verilog code and is just a practice for the sake of demonstration. The original problem statement and initial code is assumed to be correct and complete. 

The `generate` construct is a new feature in Verilog introduced in the 2005 version. It is used to create a block of code that can be turned on or off based on the value of a parameter or signal. In this case, it's used to selectively assign a constant array of values to the `rr.ir` register based
