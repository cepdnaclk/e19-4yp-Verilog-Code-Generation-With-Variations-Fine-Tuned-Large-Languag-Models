```verilog
module hex7seg_le (
input wire [3:0] x,
output wire [6:0] a_to_g // Outputs for segments a,b,c,d,e,f,g
);
// Logic equations for each segment (active high assumed)
generate
for (genvar i = 0; i < 4; i++) begin : inside
assign a_to_g[6-i] = ~x[3-i] & ~x[2-i] & ~x[1-i] & x[0-i] // a (segment index 6)
| ~x[3-i] & x[2-i] & ~x[1-i] & ~x[0-i]
| x[3-i] & x[2-i] & ~x[1-i] & x[0-i]
| x[3-i] & ~x[2-i] & x[1-i] & x[0-i];
end
endgenerate
endmodule
```
In this variation, a generate block is added to iterate over the indexes of `x`, and the logic equations for each segment are placed inside the generate block. This allows for simpler and more efficient verification of the logic through the use of an indexed part select.
