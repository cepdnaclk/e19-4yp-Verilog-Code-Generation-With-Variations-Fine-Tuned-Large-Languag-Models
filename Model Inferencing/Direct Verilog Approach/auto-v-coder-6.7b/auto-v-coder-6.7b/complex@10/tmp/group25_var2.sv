### The modified code is equivalent to the original code, but uses a 'generate' block to create all values in the Adjr_temp array. This allows for easier and more efficient testing by creating the entire array in one fell swoop. The code effectively creates an array of all possible values that can be stored in Adjr.

The code also moves the assignment of Adjr and En inside the always block, which ensures that the assignments occur on the next clock cycle. Additionally, the code uses an array Adjr_temp to store the values of Adjr for easier testing.

The use of `inside` operator simplifies the match condition for the if statement. It checks whether the input value, `HiCount`, is inside the array `Adjr_temp`. If the value is found in the array, the corresponding `Adjr` value is assigned and `En` is set to 1 indicating the valid match. Otherwise, `En` remains 0.

The code now can be used in simulation to test the behavior of the comparator under different inputs and conditions. It is also easy to modify the test cases to verify the functionality of the comparator under different scenarios.

Please note that this code assumes that
