```verilog
module ttst_ttrimux2_1(); 
reg e;
reg [1:0]i; 
reg s;
wire out; // Added wire declaration

generate
    if (1'b1) begin : inside_s
        ttrimux2_1 mm(out, e, i, s); // Instantiation requires correct MUX definition
    end
    else begin : outside_s
        initial begin
            e =0; i = 2'b00; s = 1'b0; 
        end
        always begin
        end
        initial $monitor($time," enable e = %b, s= %b, input i = %b,output out = %b ",e,s,i,out);
        initial #48 $stop;
    end
endgenerate
endmodule
```

In the above code, `inside_s` and `outside_s` are the names given to generate statements. The generate block is used for conditional statement. The `1'b1` condition is always satisfied, and the MUX is instantiated within `inside_s`. If condition was `1'b0`, MUX instantiation would be put in `outside_s` instead.

Remember to replace `ttrimux2_1 mm(out, e, i, s);` with the actual tristate multiplexer module name and connections. ### Note:

This code assumes that you have designed the tristate multiplexer `ttrimux2_1`, but it does not actually instantiate or connect it to the signals `out`, `e`, `i`, and `s`. The signal names are a placeholder, and you should replace them with the actual signal names in your design.
