```verilog

input [2:0] s;
input [3:0] A, B;
output reg [3:0] F;
parameter [3:0] ZERO = 4'b0000;
parameter [3:0] ONES = 4'b1111;

always @(s or A or B)
    case (s)
        0: F = ZERO;
        1: F = B - A;
        2: F = A - B;
        3: F = A + B;
        4: F = A ^ B;
        5: F = A | B;

In this code, we used two parameters `ZERO` and `ONES` to represent the 0 and 15 or 1111 respectively. This modification is beneficial as it makes our code more readable and easier to understand. Also, changing the operation to use this parameter makes it easier to modify in the future without having to change the code everywhere. The `inside` and `indexed part select` conditions are not directly applicable to Verilog, but they can be achieved with the use of array indexing and defining a constant range. In the current code, `ZERO` and `ONES` are used to represent 0 and 15 respectively. ### Note:
In this code, we assume that `s` is a binary value that represents different operations for performing mathematical and bitwise operations on the input `A` and `B`. You may modify this code based on your specific requirements. However, the basic idea remains the same - to use a parameter to define constants that are used throughout the code. If the constants are not constant, you may use a module level constant instead. For the `inside` and `indexed part select` conditions, you may need to use array indexing and array initializers in Verilog, which is outside the basic scope of this code. For a full solution, you will need to refer to a more complex Verilog code that uses these techniques.
