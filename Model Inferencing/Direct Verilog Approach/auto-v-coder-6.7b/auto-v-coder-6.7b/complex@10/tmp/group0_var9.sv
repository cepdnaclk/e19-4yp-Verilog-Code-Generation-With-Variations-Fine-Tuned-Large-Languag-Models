```verilog
module tst_or_gate();
reg[3:0]a;
reg en;
wire b;
or_gate gg(b,a,en);
reg[3:0] inside_a;

initial
begin
a = 4'h0; // Initialize input
en = 1'b0; // Initialize enable
end

initial
begin // Stimulus generation
inside_a <= a;
end

always@(*) begin
if(inside_a inside {[0:3]}) begin
$display("Inside the array slice");
end
else begin
$display("Not inside the array slice");
end
end

initial $monitor("t=%0d, en = %b, a = %h, b = %b",$time,en,a,b); // Use %h for hex 'a'
initial #30 $stop; // Stop simulation
endmodule
```
This modification will check if the number `a` lies within the range `[0:3]` or not. If it's inside the array slice then the display message "Inside the array slice" will be displayed and if it's not inside the array slice then the display message "Not inside the array slice" will be displayed. This is done in a `always@(*)` block in Verilog. ### Note:
Please ensure to have the `or_gate` module in your code or replace it with the appropriate module. Also, this solution will work properly with the given initial settings (`a=4'h0` and `en=1'b0`). However, please make sure to adjust according to the requirements of your specific project.

Also, note that the `or_gate` is assumed to be a simple OR gate, and it's not included in your code. Please replace `or_gate` with the appropriate module as per your actual design. If you need help with this, don't hesitate to ask.

Finally, you might want to consider using `$monitor` and `$strobe` for debugging purposes to print variables in a more readable format. This is just for the purpose of a simple example. ### Running the Testbench

You can run the testbench as a normal verilog simulator.
