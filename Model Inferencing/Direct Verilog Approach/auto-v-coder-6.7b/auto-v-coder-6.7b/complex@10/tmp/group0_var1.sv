```verilog
`define WIDTH 4
`define SIZE 8
module tst_or_gate();
reg a[`SIZE-1:0];
reg en;
wire b[`SIZE-1:0];
or_gate gg(b,a,en);
initial
begin
a = `SIZE'h0; // Initialize input
en = 1'b0; // Initialize enable
end
initial begin // Stimulus generation
end
initial $monitor("t=%0d, en = %b, a = %h, b = %h",$time,en,a,b); // Use %h for hex 'a'
initial #30 $stop; // Stop simulation
endmodule
```
In this modified code, `a` is an array of 8 bit registers. The `or_gate` module generates an array of 8 bit wires `b`, which are based on the OR operation between `a` and `en`.

Since `a` is only 4-bit wide, an array of 8 bit registers is used to demonstrate the functionality of the `or_gate` module with wider data widths.

The initializations are also adjusted to be consistent with the data type and width of the signals used. 

The `$monitor` statement has been updated to display the output `b` as a hexadecimal value.

To stop the simulation after 30 time units, `#30 $stop` is used.

Keep in mind that a Verilog design with wide buses could be overly large and complex to synthesize. For smaller designs, Verilog or SystemVerilog would be more fitting.

Also, note that this design does not include a `or_gate` module. You would need to create a separate module for the `or` gate operation. This code only serves as a demonstration and does not include the actual gate implementation, which would be different depending on the specific gate model you are using.

This variation is not related to the original base code, but rather demonstrates the use of wider data types and array slices in a Verilog design.

Also, ensure to replace `or_gate` with your actual module name for the OR gate operation inside the scope.

Lastly, the original base code might not function correctly without
