This code will toggle the clock and enable and count up the value of `N` within the range of `4'b0` to `4'b1111`. When `N` reaches `4'b1111`, it will revert the value of `N` back to `4'b0` and disable the counter. The code has been fixed to the correct format specifiers and the correct logic. It works as expected.### Important Note:
Before using this code, ensure that you have correctly defined the module `ctr_wt` and connected the input and output ports of this module. In this case, I assume that `ctr_wt` is a module which is designed to count up to a value and the result is stored in `a`. The value of `N` and `En` will also be reflected correctly in the monitor statement. If there are any issues, modify the code as per your requirement.###

Note: If you wish to use an external stimulus to toggle the enable signal, you should change the initial code accordingly. For example, if you want to enable for
