      nor #0.05 (b, in[i]); // Instantiate NOR gate
    end
  endgenerate
  initial begin // Initialize inputs
    for(i = 0; i < `NUM_INPUTS; i=i+1) begin
      in[i] = 1'b0; // Corrected: was 1'b1
    end
  end
  // Toggle inputs at different rates
  always #2 in[0]=~in[0];
  always #3 in[1]=~in[1];
  always #5 in[2]=~in[2];
  initial $monitor($time, "in1 = %b, in2 = %b, in3 = %b, output = %b ", in[0],in[1],in[2],b); // Removed newline
  initial #24 $stop; // Stop simulation
endmodule
```

This revised code adds a loop to initialize the inputs in a behavioral NOR gate, which should work as in the previous code. The `generate` block is used to create multiple instances of the NOR gate, and the `inside` operator is used to instantiate the NOR gate with the proper inputs. The NOR gates are tied together using the `#0.05` delay, which is the typical delay for a NOR gate. The delay should be specified according to the technology being used. Adjust this delay according to the actual delay in your design. The loop creates a separate instance for each input and connects to the output.

Please note that the behavioral NOR gate does not have a built-in "NMOS" property. To achieve the desired output, you may need to use a combination of `assign`, `always`, and `if-else` statements in your Verilog file to simulate a "NMOS" behavior.
