This code does the same thing as the original code but with the state transition in an array slice for `w`. This is done inside an SV class, as Verilog does not support array slices as part of case statement conditions. For such cases, you can use always @(*) block to avoid combinational loop. 

Please replace `width` and `[width-1:0] w` with your actual width and wire declaration. It's important to note that the width is the number of bits in `w`.
Also, you need to check if your simulation tool is capable of handling this kind of construct or not. If it is not supported, you will need to use something like `if-else` statements to implement this functionality.

Also, this code does not check that `w` is a valid input, so it's important to make sure that `w[width-1:0]` is a valid input. This is up to your design, if you want to add this, you can add a `assert` statement to make sure `w` is valid.

The output of this code should be the same as the original code. It is just a style change to make the transition more compact.

Please note that this style change might not be suitable for all Ver
