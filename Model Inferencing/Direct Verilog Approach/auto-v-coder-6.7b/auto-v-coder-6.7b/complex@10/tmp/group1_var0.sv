In this modified code, we use a `generate` block to instantiate multiple NOR gates with different output connections. The `inside` and `genvar` keywords are used to automatically generate instances with different output connections. The generate block is named as \gen_block1 and the index is set to 0 to 3 for four NOR instances. At each clock cycle, the output of the NOR gate will be displayed in the $monitor. When the simulation time reaches 24, the simulation will stop. 

Please ensure you have a definition for `nor3NMOS` at the top of your code. This code is designed to function as a basic testbench for the NOR gate. However, you'd need to provide a definition for `nor3NMOS` in order to run the simulation. ### NOTE: This is a conceptual explanation, you may want to replace the `nor3NMOS` definition with your actual module definition for the NOR gate. Also, this example assumes that you are using a simulation tool that supports Verilog `generate-for` statements. If you are simulating with a different tool, the syntax and behavior may vary.
