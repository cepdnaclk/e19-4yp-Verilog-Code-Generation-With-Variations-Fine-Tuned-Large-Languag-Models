### Note:
The code above is an example of using generate blocks based on the size of an internal register `ir`. Itâ€™s recommended to replace `$bits(ir)` with the appropriate system verilog function to get the size of the internal register in the target design. The `generate` block generates the appropriate code based on the size of `ir`. 

The `if-else` construct in the `generate` block only executes one of the `outside` or `inside` code path, depending on the result of `$bits(ir)`. The `inside` code path is only executed when the size of `ir` is 16. If the size of `ir` is not 16, the code in the `outside` branch will be executed. If the size of `ir` is not known at compile time, the `inside` branch can not be executed if synthesis tool is used, but synthesis will still be correct for the `outside` branch. Thus, this construct can be used to conditionally generate code based on the size of an internal register.

In this specific configuration, it will only execute the inside code when `ir` is of size 16. This is not necessarily related to the use of this construct in verilog to solve the problem of wrapping an instantiation in
