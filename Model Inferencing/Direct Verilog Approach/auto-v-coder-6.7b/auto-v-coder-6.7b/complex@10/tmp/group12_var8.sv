This code will have the DFF altered such that presetting the data to 1 or 0 is an asynchronous activity and has a different value from the preset value. This variation will help show that a DFF can indeed handle asynchronous presets. The `di` is being toggled at every 4 time units and the data is asynchronously shifted out of the 1st bit of `di` and into the 0th bit. Hence, the DFF is driven to `0` on preset and `1` otherwise. Hence, `di` becomes `1` and the `q` output becomes `0` when `pr` is asserted. The `q` output becomes `1` when `pr` is deasserted. And the `qb` output is `1` when `pr` is asserted and `0` when `pr` is deasserted. This behaviour gives the DFF ability to handle
