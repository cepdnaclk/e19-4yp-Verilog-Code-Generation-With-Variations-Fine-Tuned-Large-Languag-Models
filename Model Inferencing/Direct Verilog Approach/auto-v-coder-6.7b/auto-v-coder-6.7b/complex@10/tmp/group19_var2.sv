In the above code, we have declared an interface `ArrayInterface` having `signals`  array of 4 elements each of 16-bit wide. In the `addern` module, we have used this array to store the values of `S` inside the `signals[0]` index. This was done for the sake of verifying the code with different tools and not just by synthesising the design. ### NOTE: The design should be synthesised and test conditions should be identified correctly. ### Variation Explanation:
The `inside` operator is not used in Verilog. But if there were any tool constraints that required the use of `inside` operator, the above code could have been used to simulate and test. The original code was just synthesized to demonstrate the concept. In this case, the `inside` operator has been replaced with a simple assignment statement.

The use of an array in interface scope is a common way of sharing data between modules in a design. The `signals` array was used to mimic the typical use case where an
