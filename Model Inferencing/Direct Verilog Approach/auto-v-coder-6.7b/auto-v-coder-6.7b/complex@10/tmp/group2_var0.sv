// Instantiate the Multiplier Unit Under Test
Multiplier uut ( clk, start, databus, lsb_out, msb_out, done );

... // Other blocks remain the same

// --- Clock generation ---
always #50 clk = ~clk;

// --- Data bus driving ---
assign databus = im_data; // Drive internal data onto bus
```
In this code, the `generate` statement is used to generate multiple instances of the `always` block that drives the operands. This allows the code to cover all possible combinations of operands, testing MDA array selects. This provides a comprehensive coverage of multiplier operation.

Note that the `clk` is driven with a 50ns delay, which is used to give the multiplier enough time to process each instruction. 

Finally, the `assign` statement drives the `databus` with the `im_data`, which effectively simulates the multiplier sending data onto the bus for processing.

This code also includes the original `done`, `lsb_out`, and `msb_out` that were present in the initial code snippet. These are included to make the design complete and testable.

Please modify the module instantiation `Multiplier uut` to your actual module name. Also, ensure that the `Multiplier` module is correctly implemented, as this is the main part of the multiplier unit tested in this example. Note that the `Multiplier` module is responsible for shifting the bits and creating the result. 

For the `generate` code, each case will represent a different operation in the multiplier. The `if(start)` condition is to make
