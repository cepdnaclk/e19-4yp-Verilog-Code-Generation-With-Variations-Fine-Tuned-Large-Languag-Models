```verilog
module test_carry;
reg a, b, c;
integer i;
wire cout;
carry c1(cout, c, a, b);

generate
    for (genvar i = 0; i < 9; i = i + 1) begin
        initial begin
            $monitor("time=%d a=%b b=%b c=%b---------cout=%b", $time, a, b, c, cout);
            {a, b, c} = i;
        end
    end
endgenerate

initial begin
    a = 'bx;
    b = 'bx;
end

endmodule
```

In the modified code, we have wrapped the initial block inside a generate block. This allows us to iterate over `i` without having to explicitly write `for` loops, as in the original code. The generate block will create a separate initial block for each iteration of `i`. Finally, the last initial block doesn't depend on `i`, so it can be outside the generate block. This way, we create independent initial blocks for each iteration of `i` and one additional initial block for the final values of `a` and `b`. The `'bx` value is assigned to `a` and `b` in the final iterations which are not relevant to the `i` iterations. This ensures that the simulation can run to completion without warnings about undefined variables.
 
Be sure to replace the `carry` module and `carry` module's ports with your actual module and port details, as these are not included in your question. Also, make sure that the `carry` module has a sensitivity list that includes `a`, `b`, and `c`. This ensures that the simulation updates the outputs whenever the inputs change.
