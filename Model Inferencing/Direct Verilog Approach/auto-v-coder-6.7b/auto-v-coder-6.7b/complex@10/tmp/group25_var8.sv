```

In this modified code, `HiCount` is defined in the CounterPkg package. The comparator logic has been moved into a separate module, which takes the Value_in and compares it to the HiCount value. The HiCount value is set at the top-level of the module. The comparator output is assigned to the `Val_out` variable. The test pattern in the t_comparator module has been updated to demonstrate the functionality.

Note: The comparator functionality is highly simplified and is for educational purposes only. More complex logic such as handling edge cases and other corner cases might be needed for a real-world application. The test pattern in the t_comparator module now tests both high and low inputs, which is typical for combinational logic verification tests.### 

### Variation Instruction:
We are going to use the same package-scope array and `inside` operator on `HiCount` in the comparator logic and we will
