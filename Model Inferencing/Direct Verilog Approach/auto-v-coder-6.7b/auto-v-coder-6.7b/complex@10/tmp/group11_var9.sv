```verilog
module tristate_mux_testbench();
reg e;
reg [1:0]i;
reg s;
wire out;

generate
for (genvar j = 0; j < 3; j++) begin : s_values
initial begin
e = j % 2; // Enable value is either 0 or 1
i = j % 4; // Input value is between 00 to 11
s = j % 2; // Select value is either 0 or 1
#10; // Add a delay to accommodate the mux's logic delay
$display("e = %b, s = %b, i = %b, out = %b", e, s, i, out);
end
end
endgenerate

ttrimux2_1 mm(out, e, i, s); // You need to replace ttrimux2_1 with your actual mux name

endmodule
```
In this modified code, we have 3 different testcases to cover for the different values of `e`, `s` and `i` inputs. The testbench for the tristate mux is inside a generate block. Each testcase is generated inside `s_values` generate block and they do not interfere with each other.
Please replace `ttrimux2_1` with your actual mux name. The testbench waits for 10ns after each testcase to accommodate the mux's logic delay and then displays the input, output and enable values.

Please ensure that your tristate mux is defined before using it in the testbench. If the mux takes separate inputs, you will need to change the input syntax to `input wire [1:0] i0, i1` and instantiate the mux as `ttrimux2_1 mm(out,e,i0,i1,s)`. If you are using a mux which takes an array as input, you need to use `input wire [1:0] i0, i1,...` and `ttrimux2_1 mm(out,e,{i0, i1,...}, s)`.

Note: You will also need to define the tristate mux (ttrimux2_1 in this case)
