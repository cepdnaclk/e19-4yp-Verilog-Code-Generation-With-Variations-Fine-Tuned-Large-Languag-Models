parameter width = 4;
interface [width-1:0] data;

    C[0] = carryin;
    for (k = 0; k <= n-1; k = k + 1)
    begin
        S[k] = data.inside(k)[0] ^ data.inside(k)[1] ^ C[k];
        C[k+1] = (data.inside(k)[0] & data.inside(k)[1]) | (C[k] & data.inside(k)[0]) | (C[k] & data.inside(k)[1]);
    end
    carryout = C[n];
end
endmodule
```
In the code above, `data.inside(k)` is used to refer to the `k`-th index of the array `data`. This is done to allow for dynamic indexing. The array `data` in the interface scope is defined to be of `width` elements, each having `width` bits. `n` is set to be the total width of the `data` array. 

The original `addern` module was modified to accommodate the new definition of the `data` interface and thus can now work with dynamic arrays. The interface array `data` is used in the `always` block of the `addern` module to calculate the sum `S` of the inputs. `carryout` is calculated based on the carry propagation of the sum. The module now accepts `n`-bit array `data` as an input and calculates the sum and carryout with the number of bits specified by the parameter `n`. 

This solution offers a flexible approach to handling dynamic arrays and allows for easy adjustments to the size of the inputs and outputs as required. It provides better scalability and versatility in terms of variable size data inputs and outputs. However, it needs to be noted that the `
