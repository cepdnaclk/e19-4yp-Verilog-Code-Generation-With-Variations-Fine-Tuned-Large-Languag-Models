In this code, I am using a counter to validate async preset behavior. If cnt value changes on clock rising edge and it's not 0, it will assert preset. The variable `cnt` is initialised as 0 and incremented on clock rising edge. When `cnt` is not 0, the preset signal `pr` will assert for 20 time units, which is before the simulation ends. 

Please, ensure that you replace the DUT instantiation with your DFF or other flip flop module. Also, ensure that the module has the same exact port names as above. This code will not compile if the names or number of ports differ. Note that this is a simplified testbench to demonstrate async preset behavior. Real world designs need much more comprehensive testbenches. 

Please be aware that the logic for handling async preset and clear should be carefully designed to meet your specific needs. This simple testbench just demonstrates the concept.### Alternative Instruction:
