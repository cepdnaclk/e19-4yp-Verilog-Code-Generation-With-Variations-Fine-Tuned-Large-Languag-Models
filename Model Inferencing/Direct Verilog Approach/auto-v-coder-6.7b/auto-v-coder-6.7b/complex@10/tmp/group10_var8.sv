In this code, `1'bZ` represents the floating state of the signal. When `s` or `r` goes to `0`, it de-asserts and `q` and `q_b` goes into floating state. These changes will make the signals `q` and `q_b` become tri-state, just like a D Flip-Flop. Make sure to use `assign` statement instead of `deassign` in the `else` branch. ### Note: Make sure to properly declare the input and output signals according to your requirement, otherwise the code might not work as expected. Also, ensure that you have declared `s`, `r`, `clk` and `d` in the input of your module declaration.

You can replace `1'bZ` with `1'b0` or `1'b1` in the `assign` statements to make `q` and `q_b` to be a constant 0 or 1 on the default state. 

Remember, `1'bZ` means a high-impedance state, similar to `X` in Verilog. Also `always @(s)` or `always @(r)` is not recommended for combinational logic blocks, as Verilog will give a warning message. Use `always @(*)` to avoid this. ### This is the basic way to make the signals `q` and `q_b` into tri-state. They will function as a D Flip-Flop until they are not driven by any logic. Keep in mind that `assign` in Verilog is a continuous assignment statement. It will continuously assign the values to the left hand side (LHS
