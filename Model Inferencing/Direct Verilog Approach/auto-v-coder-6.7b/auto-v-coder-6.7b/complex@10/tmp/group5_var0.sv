In this variation, the original FSM is placed inside an `always` block that is triggered by FSM state `y` and input `w`. Instead of using `case`, the `if` and `else` conditions have been used to generate the state transition. The state `y` and `z` are updated inside the `always` block to avoid metastability. The `Resetn` signal is used to reset state `y` to `A` on the falling edge.

The state `Y` is used to hold the next state that will be updated in the next clock cycle. The `z` is used to generate the output of the FSM. If `w` is 1, the output `z` will be 0 and `Y` will be 1, which means the next state will be `B`. If `w` is 0, the output `z` will be 0 and `Y` will be 0, which means the next state will be `A`.

This version of the code is similar to the original FSM, but it uses synchronous coding and array slicing with an SV class. It also avoids the metastability problem by updating the state and output in the same clock cycle. It also uses the reset signal to reset the state `y` to 0 on the falling edge. It fulfills all the design specifications for the Moore machine FSM.
