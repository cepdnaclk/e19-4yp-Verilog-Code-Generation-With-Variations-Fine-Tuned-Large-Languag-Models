```verilog
module mixed_sim;
reg [1:0] dcontrol;
reg [31:0] data;
reg x, y;
wire [31:0] bus;
assign bus = (dcontrol == 2'b11)? data : 'bz;
always @(*)
   y = ~x;
initial
begin
$monitor("time=%d dcontrol=%b data=%d x=%d y=%d bus=%d",
         $time, dcontrol, data, x, y, bus);
dcontrol = 2'b00;
end
endmodule
```
In the modified code, we changed the `dcontrol` to a bit vector type, `[1:0]`, which is suitable for 2 bit control signals. We then used a constant array slice declared in a package to compare, as this is the appropriate way to handle 2-bit control signals in Verilog. The modified code uses a 2-bit control signal, `dcontrol`, and compares it with a binary mask to determine the `bus` output. The `always @(*)` statement is used to make the Mealy machine simulation more like a traditional 5 state design, allowing the `y` signal to be updated appropriately. The `$monitor` statement has also been adjusted to suit the 2-bit state of `dcontrol`. The `x` signal, used in the `y = ~x` statement, is not set in the initial block. This is because the behavior of the `y` signal is undefined during the initialization phase and so any initialization of `x` will not affect what is expected for `y`. In this case, we might still use an initial block to assign values to `dcontrol` and `data`. However, `x` is not explicitly updated in the `always` block or the initial block. Therefore, it is not necessary to explicitly set `x` in the initial block. It's worth noting that, depending on the specific use case and state machine requirements, you may need to adjust this code to match your specific simulation requirements.### References:
