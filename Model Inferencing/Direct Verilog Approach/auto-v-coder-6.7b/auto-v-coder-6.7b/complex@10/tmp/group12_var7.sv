In this modified code, the `dffalter` module is instantiated in the testbench. The testbench is designed to start with clear asserted, toggle data bit `di` at every posedge of clock every 4 time units, and assert and deassert preset at 16 and 20 time units respectively.
The simulation continues until 46 time units have passed. `$monitor` is used to display the current status of all variables in the testbench at every posedge of the clock. The `$stop` command is used to stop the simulation after 46 time units.

Remember to include the appropriate package for the `dffalter` module. The package and the module file are assumed to exist. If they do not, you need to replace these with your actual package and module files.

Also, the testbench is designed to work with the `dffalter` module and assumes that it has the same pin names as in the original code. If the names or the order of the inputs or outputs in the `dffalter` module have changed, you may need to adjust the testbench accordingly.
