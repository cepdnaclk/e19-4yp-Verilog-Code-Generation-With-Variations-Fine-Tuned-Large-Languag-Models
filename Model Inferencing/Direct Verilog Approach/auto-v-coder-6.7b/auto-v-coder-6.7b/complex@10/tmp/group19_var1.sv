```Verilog
module addern(carryin, X, Y, S, carryout, D);
parameter n = 16;
input carryin;
input [n-1:0] X, Y;
output [n-1:0] S;
output carryout;
reg [n-1:0] S;
reg [n:0] C;
reg carryout;
reg [n-1 downto 0] D;
input [n-1:0] D;
integer k;
always @(X or Y or carryin or D)
begin
    C[0] = carryin;
    for (k = 0; k <= n-1; k = k + 1)
    begin
        S[k] = X[k] ^ Y[k] ^ C[k];
        C[k+1] = (X[k] & Y[k]) | (C[k] & X[k]) | (C[k] & Y[k]);
    end
    carryout = C[n];
end
endmodule
```
In this variation, I have added a new input `D` of same width as `X` and `Y`. I have also added this signal to the sensitivity list for the `always` block. This ensures that the module is reevaluated whenever `D` changes. The module is then instantiated with a `D` signal as an input:
```Verilog
reg [15:0] A;
reg [15:0] B;
wire [15:0] Sum;
wire CarryOut;
addern adder1(1'b0, A, B, Sum, CarryOut, "{"<<n<<":"<<n-1<<"}'b1111");
```
Here, I have used a constant value to initialize `D`. This approach is applicable for various Verilog primitives. Note that the value in the `inside` operator is a constant, so it can vary from design to design according to the requirements. The above code will initialize `D` with all 1's, which is a constant in this context.

The code in the `always` block will use the value of `D` to perform an operation based on the specific requirements
