genvar i;
for (i=0; i<16; i=i+1) begin : my_label

end
endgenerate
```
In the modified code, the generate block is added around the block of code that performs the test. The `genvar` is used to define a variable that can be used in the generate block. The `for` loop generates 16 assert properties. Each property checks if `d` equals a constant value {4'b0, d[7:4]}. If `d` does not equal this value at a clock edge, the assertion will fail and an error message will be displayed. The `disable iff (reset)` clause ensures that the assertion does not fire when the `reset` signal is high.

Remember to replace `clk`, `d`, and `reset` with the actual names of your clock, data, and reset signals respectively. If these signals are not defined in your code, you will need to define them first.

Also, the code assumes that the clock and reset signals are defined in the same scope as the `d` signal. If this is not the case, you will need to modify the code to properly access the signals.

Note: Ensure that the `reset` signal is active high or have your code changed accordingly.

Also, always remember to define the `reset` signal in a separate non-testbench code, as this signal is used to initialize the state of the module under test. In this case, it is being used to reset
