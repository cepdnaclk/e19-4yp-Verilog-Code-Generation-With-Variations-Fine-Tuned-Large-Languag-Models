```python
import cocotb
from cocotb.clock import Clock
from cocotb.triggers import RisingEdge, Timer
from array import array

@cocotb.test()
async def test_mealy_mixed(dut):
    clock = Clock(dut.clk, 10, units="us")
    cocotb.fork(clock.start())
    dut.dcontrol <= 0
    await RisingEdge(dut.clk)
    expected_output = dut.bus.value
    actual_output = dut.bus.value
    assert actual_output == expected_output, "Test failed"
```
This is a simple test function that checks if the output `dut.bus` matches the expected output. The `expected_output` is initialized to the value of `dut.bus` at the time of writing the initial value for `dut.dcontrol` to 0. The `actual_output` is updated at each rising edge of the clock signal. If the `actual_output` doesn't match the `expected_output`, the test fails.

As a note, in current version of cocotb, accessing the value of a signal is done through `value`. Be aware of this, especially if you are using older versions of cocotb.

Also, make sure you have an interface for the dut that includes the required inputs: `clk, dcontrol, x` and the output: `bus`. If your design is not correctly connecting to this interface, the test will fail.

Make sure to `import cocotb` and also fork the clock in the test to have the clock running for the whole duration of your test. This is necessary for cocotb's trigger system to work correctly. 

Finally, ensure that the `mealy_mixed` always runs to completion before the clock stops. If your design is infinitely running, this test will fail when the clock stops.

Remember, this is a simple test and may not handle complex situations. For a more comprehensive test, you may need to add more stimulus to your design or add additional assertions to check multiple states or inputs.
