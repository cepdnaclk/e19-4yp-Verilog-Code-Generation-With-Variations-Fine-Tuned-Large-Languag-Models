```verilog
module tstdlatch; //test-bench
reg d,en;
wire q,qb;
// dlatch ff(en,d,q,qb); // Assuming instantiation of a D latch module
initial
begin
d = 1'b0;
en = 1'b0; // Latch disabled
end
always #4 en =~en; // Enable toggles every 4 time units
always #8 d=~d; // Data toggles every 8 time units
initial $monitor($time," en = %b, d = %b, q = %b, qb = %b ", en,d,q,qb);
initial #40 $stop;
endmodule
```

The code above is a base model for a D latch test-bench in Verilog. It sets a default value of `en` and `d` at `0` and `0` respectively. The `en` value is toggled every `4` time units, and the `d` value is toggled every `8` time units. The `$monitor` task prints out the current state of `en`, `d`, `q`, and `qb` at each time step. The `$stop` command is used to end the simulation after `40` time units.

In the case of replacing `flush_P0_P1` with an `inside` check of `state` against a packed range, the code would need to be updated accordingly. It would look something like:

```verilog
module tstdlatch; //test-bench
reg d,en;
wire q,qb;
// dlatch ff(en,d,q,qb); // Assuming instantiation of a D latch module
initial
begin
d = 1'b0;
en = 1'b0; // Latch disabled
end
always #4 en =~en; // Enable toggles every 4 time units
always #8 d=~d; // Data toggles every 8 time units
initial $monitor($time," en = %b, d = %b, q = %b, qb = %b ", en,d,q,qb);
initial #40 $stop
