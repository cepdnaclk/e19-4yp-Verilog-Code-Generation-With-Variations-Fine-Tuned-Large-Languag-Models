    S_values[0] = 2'b00;
    S_values[1] = 2'b01;
    S_values[2] = 2'b10;
    S_values[3] = 2'b11;
end
always @(w0 or w1 or w2 or w3 or S) begin
    if (S inside {S_values}) begin
        case(S)
            2'b00: f = w0;
            2'b01: f = w1;
            2'b10: f = w2;
            2'b11: f = w3;
        endcase
    end
    else
        f = 1'bz;  // Indicate a don't care state if S is outside defined values
end
endmodule
```
In the above code, we've declared an array `S_values` at module scope that contains the expected values for the `S` input. Then, inside the `always` block, we've used the `inside` keyword to check if our `S` input is inside this array. If it is, we've used a `case` statement to select the corresponding `f` output. If `S` is not in our list of expected values, we've set `f` to `1'bz` which is a state that indicates don't care. This makes it easier to debug, as `f` will not be defined in all cases, but it will be defined when the inputs are valid.

This code should behave the same as the previous one but with better readability and maintainability. As a result, it is recommended to use this version for larger projects.
### Explanation:
Using `inside` construct is more readable and maintainable than using multiple `if` conditions. It expresses the intention of the programmer clearly. And it provides better support for simulators and tools, that might require more precise simulation of the
