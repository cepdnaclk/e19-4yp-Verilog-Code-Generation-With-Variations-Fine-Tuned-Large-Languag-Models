```verilog
module test_carry;
reg a, b, c;
integer i;
wire cout;
carry c1(cout, c, a, b);
initial
begin
$monitor("time=%d a=%b b=%b c=%b---------cout=%b", $time, a, b, c, cout);
for (i = 0; i < 9; i = i + 1)
begin
{a, b, c} = i;
end
a = 'bx;
b = 'bx;
end
endmodule
```
The generate block and `inside` operator can be used as follows:
```verilog
module test_carry;
reg a, b, c;
integer i;
wire cout;
carry c1(cout, c, a, b);

generate
for (genvar i = 0; i < 9; i = i + 1) 
begin : gen_test
    initial
    begin
        $monitor("time=%d a=%b b=%b c=%b---------cout=%b", $time, a, b, c, cout);
        {a, b, c} = i;
    end
end 
endgenerate

assign a = 'bx;
assign b = 'bx;

endmodule
```
In this code, we are adding a `generate` block to iterate over the range of `i` to 9 and creating a separate `initial` block for each iteration. Inside each `initial` block, we assign the value of `i` to `a`, `b`, and `c`. This ensures that the code is self-checking for all possible input combinations, i.e., from `0` to `8` for `a`, `b`, and `c`. When all possible input values are exhausted, we assign `'bx` to `a` and `b`, which indicates an undefined state. This ensures that the code will not hang or stop at the first possible input combination.
