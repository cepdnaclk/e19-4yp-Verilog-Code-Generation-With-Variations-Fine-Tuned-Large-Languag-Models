```verilog
module mux4to1(w0, w1, w2, w3, S, f);
input w0, w1, w2, w3;
input [1:0] S;
output f;
reg f;
always @(w0 or w1 or w2 or w3 or S)
    begin
        reg [1:0] S_array;
        S_array = 2'b00;
        if (S == S_array)
            f = w0;
        S_array = 2'b01;
        if (S == S_array)
            f = w1;
        S_array = 2'b10;
        if (S == S_array)
            f = w2;
        S_array = 2'b11;
        if (S == S_array)
            f = w3;
    end

This variation compares each possible input to the array constant, and so it is more compact and understandable. It essentially checks if `S` is equal to each possible value. If it is, it assigns the respective value to `f`. This version allows for the flexibility of having inputs `w0` through `w3` corresponding to the values `00`, `01`, `10`, `11` in binary. It also allows for more flexibility in the future if you need more inputs or more comparisons.

For this version to work, you need to assign the correct value to `f` based on the value of `S`. Any unused inputs should be set to `f` as `0` or `1` based on what you need for your specific application.### This modified code is more compact and easier to manage, especially if you need to add more control signals and inputs in the future. It allows for a single-line assignment of an output depending on the current input conditions. In this case, `f` will always have the correct value depending on the current values of `w0` through `w3` and `S`.###

It's important to note that this code does not exactly match the original code as it includes unnecessarily complex `if` statements in the `always` block. However, it should work fine for this application.
