```verilog

input [2:0] s;
input [3:0] A, B;
output [3:0] F;
reg [3:0] F;
localparam [3:0] rangeArray[0:7] = '{4'b0000, 4'b0001, 4'b0010, 4'b0011, 4'b0100, 4'b0101, 4'b0110, 4'b0111};
always @(s or A or B)
    case (s)
        0: F = 4'b0000;
        1: F = B - A;
        2: F = A - B;
        3: F = A + B;
        4: F = A ^ B;
        5: F = A | B;
        6: F = A & B;
        7: F = 4'b1111;
        default: F = 4'bxxx;
    endcase
    if(!(`inside`{A} inside {[rangeArray[s][0]:rangeArray[s][1]]})) begin
        $display("Input A is not in the range defined by s\n");
    end
endmodule
```

In the modified code, we added a `default` case in the switch statement which is a good practice because all possible cases should be handled. The `$display` function is used to show a warning message when the input A is out of the range defined by s. The `inside` part select operator was used to check if the input A is within the range defined by a constant array called rangeArray for each case of switch statement. If input A is out of range, a warning message is printed on the console.

It's also worth noting that this modified code assumes the `inside` operation is valid and that the rangeArray is correctly defined. Please confirm if these assumptions hold, or change the code as necessary to fit your specific use case. 

Also, keep in mind that this might not behave as expected due to the verilog's unary `inside` operation. This operator
