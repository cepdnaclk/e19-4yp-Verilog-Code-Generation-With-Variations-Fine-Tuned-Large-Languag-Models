In the updated code, all instances of `x` are replaced with `'0` to initialize them to zero. The `inside` operator is used to compare `x` against a constant array defined in a package. The array contains the values 2, 4, 8, 16. If `x` is found inside the array, `A` is updated with the value of `x`. ### The `my_pkg` package is a placeholder for an actual package defining the constants and enumerated types used in the design. The `TOP1` module is the main module of the design, which has an input of `CLK` and `RST_X`. When `RST_X` is high, `A` is reset to all zeros. In the `TOP1` module, the `x` register is incremented every positive edge of the `CLK`. If `x` is inside the array defined in `my_pkg`, `A` is updated with the value of `x`. The testbench module `tb_TOP1` creates a clock signal and
