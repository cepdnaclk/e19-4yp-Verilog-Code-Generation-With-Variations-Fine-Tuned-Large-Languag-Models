```verilog
`define N 10
module comp
(input wire [`N-1:0] x,
input wire [`N-1:0] y,
output reg gt, // Greater than
output reg eq, // Equal
output reg lt // Less than
);
always @(*) // Combinational logic
begin
// Default outputs to 0
gt = 1'b0;
eq = 1'b0;
lt = 1'b0;
// Set flags based on comparison results
if(x > y)
gt = 1'b1;
if(x == y)
eq = 1'b1;
if(x < y)
lt = 1'b1;
end
endmodule
```

Remember to replace `N` with your desired value. In this code, everytime the signal of `gt`, `eq`, or `lt` changes, the code within the `always @(*)` block will execute. This is an example of a combinational logic block in Verilog. It monitors the inputs and sets the output signals. In this case, the `gt`, `eq`, and `lt` signals are set based on the comparison results between `x` and `y`. The values of `gt`, `eq`, and `lt` are set to 1 when the comparison is true and 0 when it is false. This can be modified to suit different types of comparisons. 

When the module is instantiated, inputs `x` and `y` can be connected to a signal or other Verilog expressions. The outputs `gt`, `eq`, and `lt` will then reflect the results of the comparison. 

If the parameters of the module are changed, the behavior of this module would change accordingly.

Please note that Verilog is a hardware description language that does not have a mechanism for a `switch` statement. Instead, we use `if`-`else if`-`else` structure. This is a common design pattern in Verilog to conditionally set outputs based on inputs.

Also remember to use the `define` macro for parameters, as it is a best practice to use define instead of using a macro to create a constant in Verilog. It can avoid potential errors if the value is mis
