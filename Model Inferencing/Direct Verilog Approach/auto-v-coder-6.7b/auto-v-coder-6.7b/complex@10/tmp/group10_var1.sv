In this verilog code, a buffer register `s_buf` and `r_buf` are added to capture the previous state of `s` and `r`. `inside` operator is then used to check if `s_buf` or `r_buf` is inside the constant value 1. If `s_buf` or `r_buf` is 1, then the `force` statement is executed to assign `q` with `d` and `q_b` with `~d`. If `s_buf` or `r_buf` is not 1, then the `release` statement is executed to de-assign `q` and `q_b`. This modified code keeps the behavior of the d flip flops as described in your previous post. The `force` and `release` statements are used to create and break the assignments to `q` and `q_b` to support the behavior of d flip flops.### Note:
1. The `force` and `release` statements are synthesizable in verilog.
2. In real hardware, these are not synthesizable as they are considered as non-synthesizable operations.### Ver
