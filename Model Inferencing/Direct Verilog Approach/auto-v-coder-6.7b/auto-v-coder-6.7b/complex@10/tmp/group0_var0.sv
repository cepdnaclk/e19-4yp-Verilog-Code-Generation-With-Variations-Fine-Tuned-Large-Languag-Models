In this variation, the `always` block is added to check if `a` is within the range of 5 (0x5) to 10 (0xA), inclusive. If `a` is outside this range, an error message is printed. This is to test the range check in Verilog.### Testing Instructions:
1. Run the code.
2. Observe the error message if `a` falls outside of the range 0x5 to 0xA.
3. If `a` is within the range, the error message will not appear.

Note: `$error` is used to print the error message in the simulation. This will help in debugging the Verilog code as it stops the simulation and gives the message "The value of 'a' is out of range". If there is no error message, that means the test passed successfully.

Make sure the code is synthesizable and that all logic gates have been correctly implemented. This example was specifically designed to exercise array slicing in Verilog. The simulation script is also designed to monitor the outputs and inputs of the or_gate module, demonstrating how it behaves under varying input conditions.```verilog
module or_gate(b,a,en);
input[3:0]a;
input en;
output reg b;

always @(*) begin
	if (en) begin
		b = (a & 4'hA
