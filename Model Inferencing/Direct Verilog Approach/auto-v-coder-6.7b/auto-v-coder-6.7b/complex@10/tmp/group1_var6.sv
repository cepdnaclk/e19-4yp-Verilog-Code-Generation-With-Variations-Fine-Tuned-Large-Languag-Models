```verilog
module tst_nor3NMOS();
  reg in1,in2,in3; wire b;
  nor3NMOS nn(in1,in2,in3,b); // Instantiate NMOS NOR
  initial begin // Initialize inputs
    in1=1'b0; in2=1'b0; in3=1'b0; // Corrected: was 1'b1
  end
  // Toggle inputs at different rates
  always #2 in1=~in1;
  always #3 in2=~in2;
  always #5 in3=~in3;
  
  always @(in1 or in2 or in3) begin
    // This will execute the following operations
    // at every change of input
    $monitor($time, "in1 = %b, in2 = %b, in3 = %b, output = %b ",in1,in2,in3,b);
  end

  initial begin
    // This will execute after 24 cycles
    #24 $stop; 
  end
endmodule
```
This modified version of the code will print the input signal values and output values in every cycle. And, the simulation will stop after 24 cycles.
Please note that the `generate` block was not used in this modified version. If you want to use a `generate` block, then you should replace the NOR gate instantiation with a `generate` block containing your desired number of NOR gates.

Also, the initial value of input signals was set to 0, so it is expected that the output of the NOR gate should be 1 (because all inputs are 0). If you want to set the initial input signals to some different values, then you should modify the `initial` block accordingly.

Remember that Verilog simulations are event-based and may not have the expected results if a variable is modified in an event that affects other variables in the same block. It's always a good practice to monitor the changes of variables in a simulation to avoid unexpected results. In this case, the `$monitor` statement is used to monitor the input and output values to verify the correctness of the simulation.
