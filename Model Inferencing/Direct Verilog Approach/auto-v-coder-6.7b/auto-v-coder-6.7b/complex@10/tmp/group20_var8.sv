package sim_pkg;
    const bit [31:0] data_Mealy [5] = {32'h00000001, 32'h00000002, 32'h00000004, 32'h00000008, 32'h00000010};

module mixed_sim;
import sim_pkg::*;
reg dcontrol, x;
reg [31:0] data;

    x = ~x;

begin
    $monitor("time=%d dcontrol=%d data=%d x=%d y=%d bus=%d",
         $time, dcontrol, data, x, ~x, bus);
    dcontrol = 0;
    for (int i=0; i<5; i++) begin
        data = data_Mealy[i];

    end
end
endmodule
```
In this variation, the input `data` is initialized with values from the `data_Mealy` package array. The `for` loop is used to iterate over each entry in the array. Each time, the input `data` is updated with the next array entry, then the simulation time waits for 10 time units before the next iteration. The `y` output does not need to be changed from the original example, as its value follows `x` and `x` does not change in this example. The array entries are {1, 2, 4, 8, 16} in binary and hexadecimal. The purpose of this variation is to demonstrate how to use constant arrays in a package and how to change the input data.
