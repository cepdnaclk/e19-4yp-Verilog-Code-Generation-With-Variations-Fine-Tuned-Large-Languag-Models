```verilog
// Define the constant 1 and 0 in interface
interface constants;
    int const1 = 1, const0 = 0;
endinterface

// Define the module with interface as an input
module d_ff (input d, clk, s, r, output reg q, q_b, output const1, const0 );
// Check if s is inside constant 1 in interface
always @( s ) begin : force_a_1
if ( s inside {constants.const1} )
begin
end else begin
deassign q;
deassign q_b;
end
end
// Check if r is inside constant 0 in interface
always @( r ) begin : force_a_0
if( r inside {constants.const0} )
begin
end else begin
deassign q;
deassign q_b;
end
end
// Use the constants inside the clocked block for verification
always @( posedge clk ) begin : clocked
// Use the constants inside the block for verification
$display("const1 = %d, const0 = %d", const1, const0);
end
endmodule
```
This modified code checks whether the input `s` is inside the constant `1` declared in the interface `constants` and `r` is inside the constant `0`. If not, it deassigns the `q` and `q_b` outputs. Additionally, it provides the constants `const1` and `const0` as outputs for verification.

Please note that in Verilog, `inside` operator is used to check if an item is present in a list. It can be used with vectors or arrays, but it's not compatible with non-vector literals (like integers or strings). In your example, `s` and `r` are not vector valued, so `inside` operator is not used. This is a limitation in using `inside` operator for integers. 

Also, remember to call the `constants` interface in your testbench to be able to instantiate these constants. For example:
```verilog
// Instantiate the constants interface
constants constants_inst();

// Instantiate the d_ff module and pass the constants interface as an input
d_ff dff_inst(.
