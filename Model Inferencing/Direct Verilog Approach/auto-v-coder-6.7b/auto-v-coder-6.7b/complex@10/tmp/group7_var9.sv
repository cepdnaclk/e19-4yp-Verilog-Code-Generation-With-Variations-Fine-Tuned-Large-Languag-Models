```verilog
module alu(s, A, B, F);
input [2:0] s;
input [3:0] A, B;
output [3:0] F;
reg [3:0] F;

// Define the constant array
parameter [31:0] const_array = {32'hFEDCBA98, 32'h87654321, 32'h12345678, 32'hABCDEF01};

// Instruction to check if A is inside the constant range array
wire is_A_in_range = A >= const_array[0] & A <= const_array[1];

always @(s or A or B)
    case (s)
        0: F = 4'b0000;
        1: F = B - A;
        2: F = A - B;
        3: F = A + B;
        4: F = A ^ B;
        5: F = A | B;
        6: F = A & B;
        7: F = is_A_in_range? const_array[2] : const_array[3];
    endcase
endmodule
```
This modification is added to the code, which includes a `const_array` parameter with 4 32-bit values. The ALU operation is modified to include a case for 7, which will return the first value of `const_array` if `A` is in the range of the first two elements of `const_array`, or the third element. Otherwise, it will return the fourth element of the constant array.

Note: The Verilog code is a simplified example and may need to be adjusted to fit the specific requirements of your ALU design. Always remember to thoroughly test your ALU to ensure all operations are working as expected and that the logic is correctly implemented.fWLWqI6YK2Q44
