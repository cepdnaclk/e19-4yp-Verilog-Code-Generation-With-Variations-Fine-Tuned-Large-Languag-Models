This code creates a D flip flop with enable input where `d` is the data bit and `q` is the output. The simulation is started with the reset condition and then toggled the `en` and `di` after each clock cycle. The `clk` signal is used as the clock signal. This is a basic example of a D flop with reset, and a testbench is also included to test the D flip flop behavior. The `$monitor` command is used to display the current state of the flip flop. The `$stop` command is used to stop the simulation after some time.### This variation of the code includes the added functionality to check `s_cnt` inside a constant array and wrap combinational block in escaped generate block.### However, remember that Verilog is not designed to handle this
