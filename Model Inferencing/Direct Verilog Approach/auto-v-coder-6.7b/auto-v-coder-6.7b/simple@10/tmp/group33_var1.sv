```verilog
// Structure to hold signed delays
typedef struct {
  bit [3:0] a, b;
} delay_t;

module ha_1(s,ca,a,b); // Half Adder with gate delays
  input a,b;
  output s,ca;
  wire a_gatelayout, b_gatelayout;
  
  delay_t delays = '{a: 1, b: 2};
  
  // Gate delays are parametrized using struct member value
  and #(delays.a, a_gatelayout, a) a_inst(a_gatelayout, a);
  and #(delays.b, b_gatelayout, b) b_inst(b_gatelayout, b);
  xor #(1,2) (s,a,b);
  and #(3,4) (ca,a,b);
endmodule
```
In this code, we define a new type `delay_t` as a packed struct with fields `a` and `b`, each of which is a 4-bit signed number. We then use these struct members in the parameter list of the built-in `and`, `or`, and `xor` primitives, which now accept values of the respective delay.

Please note that the delay values are in ns, and they are specified using the `#(delay_value, delay_pin)` syntax. The delay_value is the delay in ns, and the delay_pin is the pin on which the delay is applied.

This modified code ensures that the delays are driven by a variable, which makes it more flexible and maintainable. You can change the delay values by modifying the elements of the `delays` structure. If you want to change the delay values dynamically at runtime, you can add signal to the `delay_t` structure and modify it during the simulation. 

Remember, verilog model delay is approximate, and adding delay to the gates can potentially increase the delay of the whole circuit. It only influences the timing and thus its best to add delays to gates for debugging or verification purposes. It shouldn't be used at synthesis or as input for tools.###
