```SystemVerilog
module Problem1(input logic [3:0] a, b, output logic [3:0] sum);
  assign sum = a + b;
endmodule
```
In this modification, the `input` and `output` declarations are preceded by `logic` instead of `reg`. This code snippet can be used with SystemVerilog compatibility. The `input logic` and `output logic` declarations are used to declare the `a` and `b` as logic type variables which can be used in SystemVerilog simulations. The sum of `a` and `b` is assigned to the `sum` output.

The difference between `logic` and `reg` types in Verilog/SystemVerilog is that `logic` can handle all types of simulations, while `reg` is specific to Verilog and is used for regular logic simulation. In this specific context, there is no difference between `logic` and `reg` in SystemVerilog. However, it is good practice to use `logic` as it's more versatile. 

Moreover, SystemVerilog supports the use of `logic` without the need for a `typedef` to make it compatible with Verilog. This makes the code more portable and robust against different types of simulations.

Please note that you need to replace the reg declarations with logic declarations in your original Verilog code snippet to make it compatible with SystemVerilog. The logic type in SystemVerilog is used to specify logic signals, similar to the reg type in Verilog. In this case, the module parameter a, b and output sum, are all logic variables making them compatible with SystemVerilog simulations.

The output of this module is a 4-bit binary number that is the sum of the input binary numbers a and b. This can be used in SystemVerilog simulations. If you are running a Verilog simulation, you may want to use the reg type instead of the logic type to maintain compatibility with Verilog conventions. In that case, the logic type should be replaced by the reg type.
