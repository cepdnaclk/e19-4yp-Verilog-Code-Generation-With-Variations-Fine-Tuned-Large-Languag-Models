```verilog
// OR Gate with force/release
module or_fr_rl(output logic a, input logic b, c);
  initial begin
    #10ns $display("b=0, c=0");
    #10ns $display("b=0, c=1");
    b=1'b0; c=1'b1; #10ns $display("b=1, c=1");
    b=1'b1; c=1'b1; #10ns $display("b=1, c=1");
    $stop;
  end
  always @(*) begin
    a <= #1ns $isunknown(b) | $isunknown(c)? 1'bx : b | c;
    #2.5ns $display("a = %b", a);
  end
endmodule
```
### Testbench Code:
```verilog
// Testbench for OR gate with force/release
module orfr_tst;
  reg b,c; logic a;
  initial begin b=1'b0; c=1'b0; #20 $stop; end // Initialize inputs
  always #3 c = ~c; // Toggle input 'c' every 3 time units
  or_fr_rl dd(a,b,c); // Instantiate the module containing force/release
endmodule
```
This testbench applies a series of force and release actions to 'c', toggling its value each time it changes. The module's output, 'a', is watched to check that the OR logic is correct. This will be done after every release action, so you should see the output 'a' updated 3 times between release actions on 'c'. The force/release is a powerful tool that allows you to manipulate testbench behavior during simulation. However, use force/release judiciously and only when you are sure you need it. It can often lead to very difficult to debug designs.
Note: This variation is a simple example and may not cover the full complexity of your system or any other constraints. Be sure to include the full functionality of your system in your design and testbench. If your system is a complex combinational logic circuit, you may need to use other tools and techniques to accurately simulate and test it
