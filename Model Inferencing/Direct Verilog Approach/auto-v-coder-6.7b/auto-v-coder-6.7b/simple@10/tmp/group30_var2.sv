```Verilog
module netdelay1(x,y);
input x;
output [31:0] y;
wire [31:0] nn; // Declare wire 'nn' with 32 bit width
not #(2,1) nn[31:0](nn,x); // Assign NOT(x) to 'nn'
assign y=nn; // Assign 'nn' to 'y' (direct assignment)
endmodule
```
In this revised code, the output is declared as a packed array of 32 bits, which can be assigned the result of the NOT operation. The NOT operation is also changed to be a structural operation to test structural granularity, specifying rise and fall times for each individual bit. This code demonstrates a high-level view of how you can create a wide array of logic operations, each with different timing parameters. The result of the operation will be assigned to the output array, reflecting the width of the operation. 

Please note that the rise/fall times are in picoseconds and they should be a multiple of 20ns (100ps, 200ps, etc). They are not the same as the 'time_unit' used in Verilog simulation, which is typically 1ns by default. Asynchronous cells like 'not' in this example are also demonstrated. They behave as 1-bit cells in the IEEE 1364-1995 standard, with rise and fall times as specified. The 'not' operation can be considered as a structural gate in the Verilog syntax.

Additionally, this code snippet is only a basic example and doesn't account for the fact that real hardware can't handle delays less than 20ns. This code is just a showcase of how you could design and reason about Verilog and HDLs in general. The actual implementation may vary based on the specific hardware your system is running on. 

It's also important to note that the not operation's rise and fall times are specified in the not operation declaration, not in the wires that are driving the not operation. That is not how it is typically done in software, but it's done here to demonstrate the capability to specify different delays for different bits independently.!
