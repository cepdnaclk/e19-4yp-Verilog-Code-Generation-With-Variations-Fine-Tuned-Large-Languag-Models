In this modified code, the inputs `a` and `b` are packed into a structure `ha_9_in` and the outputs `s` and `ca` are packed into another structure `ha_9_out`. This allows you to test struct signal routing similar to the original code. The signals `a` and `b` are driven based on varying values of `clk`. The outputs from `s` and `ca` are printed alongside the corresponding inputs. The delay between changes to `a` and `b` is set to 5 ns. The testbench runs for 30 ns before stopping.

Please note that the struct signal routing is not the same as struct signal assignment. The struct signal assignment allows you to assign a single struct to another struct and will copy the bits of each field in the source struct to the corresponding field in the destination struct. With struct signal routing, the actual bit values of the fields are not copied; the names of the fields are used to match the
