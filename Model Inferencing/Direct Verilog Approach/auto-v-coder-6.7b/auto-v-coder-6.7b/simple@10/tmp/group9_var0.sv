```verilog
module Problem8(
    input [3:0] a, b,
    output [3:0] diff

    struct packed {
        logic [1:0] x;
        logic [1:0] y;
        logic z;
    } s1, s2;

    s1.x = a[3:2];

    s1.z = a[0];

    s2.x = b[3:2];
    s2.y = b[1:0];
    s2.z = b[0];

    assign diff = s1.x >= s2.x? (s1.x - s2.x) << 2 : 4'b1111;
    assign diff[1:0] = s1.y >= s2.y? (s1.y - s2.y) : 2'b11;
    assign diff[0] = s1.z >= s2.z? (s1.z - s2.z) : 1'b1;

In this variation, we have replaced the reg declarations with a packed structure that includes the signals x, y, and z. We have also modified the assignments to test packed structure handling. The input a and b are now assigned to the x and y fields of the structure, and the ith bit of a and b are assigned to the ith bit of the structure's x and y fields. The result is then assigned to the diff output. This variation demonstrates how a packed structure can be used to handle multiple signals in a single line. Note that this variation assumes that a and b are 4-bit unsigned numbers, and the result will be the 4-bit difference between a and b, with wraparound for the bitwise subtraction. The resulting value is then assigned to diff, as in the original problem description. 

Please note that Verilog has two main ways to declare packed structures: `struct packed` and `logic [n-1:0]`. The `struct packed` method is used in this problem to declare packed structures. The `logic [n-1:0]` method is used for unpacked arrays or std_logic_vector arrays
