// Verilog code for Problem 4
module XOR_Gate(
    input logic [1:0] A [0:3],
    input logic [1:0] B [0:3],
    output logic [1:0] Y [0:3]
);
    always_comb begin
        for(int i=0; i<4; i++) begin
            Y[i] = A[i] ^ B[i];
        end
    end
endmodule

In this modified code, `A` and `B` are 2D packed logic-vector arrays with each element occupying 2 bits, and `Y` is another 2D packed logic-vector array with the same size as `A` and `B`. The inside operator `^` is used to carry out XOR operation between corresponding elements in `A` and `B`, and the result is stored in `Y`. This example demonstrates the ability to handle multi-dimensional arrays in Verilog. It can further be enhanced to work with arrays of higher dimensions, depending on the specific problem requirements.

NOTE: The inside operator `^` is used to perform XOR operation between corresponding elements in `A` and `B`. This is an example of a packed array usage. It is not strictly necessary, but is a common usage in Verilog. It enables you to write your logic in a compact format. The `^` operator only applies at the element level and does not apply to the entire array.

Furthermore, always_comb is used to avoid latch behavior. This ensures the combinational logic won't produce any latching behavior and makes the code clearer for readers, especially those unfamiliar with latch-based coding styles. In essence, always_comb is a Verilog construct to make sure the circuit is logically combinational.

Finally, notice that a for-loop is used inside an always_comb block to iterate through the elements of the arrays. This is a common practice in Verilog for array handling, and it is done to avoid latch behavior by creating a separate block for each element. This is a simplification and will fit for the given problem. However, it's good to know that this approach should be adapted according to the specific problem requirements.
