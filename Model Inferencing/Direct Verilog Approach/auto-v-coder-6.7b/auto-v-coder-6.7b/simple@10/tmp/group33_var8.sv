```verilog
module ha_1(s,ca,a,b); // Half Adder with gate delays
  input a,b; output s,ca;
  
  // Define a structure with signed members
  typedef struct packed {
    bit [0:31] s,ca;
  } delays_t;
  
  // Initialize a value of the structure
  delays_t delays = '{s:1, ca:2};
  
  // Assign parameters to an xor and an and gate
  xor #(delays.s) (s,a,b);
  and #(delays.ca) (ca,a,b);
  
endmodule
```

In this modified code, we have defined a structure called `delays_t` with two signed members `s` and `ca`. We then created an instance of the structure called `delays` and initialized it with some values. Finally, we used these values as parameters for the `xor` and `and` gates in the half adder. This allows us to dynamically vary the gate delays based on the values in the `delays_t` structure. 

Note: This is a simple example and does not truly demonstrate the functionality of structured programming, as a variable of the structure type can simply be treated as a list of constants (or "composite constants"). The real use of structures in Verilog is more complex and involves creating objects of these structures in a more complex way, for instance you might create an array of these structures or use case statements to assign different values to the structure depending on some other signals. This is beyond the scope of this simple demonstration.```verilog
module ha_1(s,ca,a,b); // Half Adder with gate delays
  input a,b; output s,ca;
  
  // Define a structure with signed members
  typedef struct packed {
    bit [0:31] s,ca;
  } delays_t;
  
  // Create an array of these structures, one for each gate delay
  delays_t delays[2] = '{1'b1,'1'b1,2'b10};
  
  // Assign parameters to an xor and an and gate
