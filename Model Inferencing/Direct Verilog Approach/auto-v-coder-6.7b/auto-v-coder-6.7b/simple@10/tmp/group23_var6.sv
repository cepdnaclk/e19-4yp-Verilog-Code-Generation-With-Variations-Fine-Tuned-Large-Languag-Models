```verilog
module FourFlopsStructL #(parameter DClk = 2, DBuf = 1)
(output byte Q, input byte D, input Ena, Clk);
wire[3:0] QWire;
localparam DTot = DBuf + DClk;
DFF DReg[3:0] (.Q(QWire),.D(D),.Clk(Clk));
assign #DTot Q = (Ena==1'b1)? QWire : 'bz;
endmodule
```
This code still includes a flip-flop-type structure with four flip-flops, but the input and output ports are of byte type rather than logic. This should be helpful to simulate and optimize, especially with system verilog.

For the specific case of a system verilog design, it is better to use logic type as default, unless there's a specific need for byte-level control. This ensures consistent behavior across different tool sets and verification environments. However, the logic type does not necessarily reflect the specific behavior of the D Flip-Flops.

Note: Be sure to test this change thoroughly to ensure that it continues to function as expected. 

Also, remember that this change requires a simulation environment that supports byte-level operations. If your simulation tool does not support byte-wide data types, the code will need to be adjusted accordingly. Also, this would only work if the input byte is mapped to a logic value.

Remember, there is no single 'correct' answer for this, these are simply possibilities based on the specific scenario and the requirements of the project. Be sure to thoroughly test the modified code for stability and compatibility with your specific simulation and synthesis setup.
