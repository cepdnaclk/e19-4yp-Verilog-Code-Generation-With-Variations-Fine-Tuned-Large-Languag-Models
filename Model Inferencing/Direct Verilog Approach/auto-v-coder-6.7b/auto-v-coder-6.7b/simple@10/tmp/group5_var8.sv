```verilog
module tst_dff_pbeh();
  logic di,clk; wire do;
  dff_p d1(do,di,clk); // Instantiate DFF with path delay
  initial begin clk=0; di=1'b0; #35 $stop; end // Initialize & stop
  always #3 clk=~clk; // Generate clock (negedges at 6, 12, 18...)
  always #5 di=~di; // Toggle data
  initial $monitor($time,"clk=%b, di=%b, do=%b",clk,di,do);
endmodule
```
Verilog and SystemVerilog share the same syntax, but SystemVerilog adds support for more types, such as integer, time, real, etc. The logic type is a preferred alias for the more complete integer type, and the logic vector type is a preferred alias for the more complete integer vector type. This change should work in either Verilog or SystemVerilog context. Please replace the "dff_p d1(do,di,clk);" block with the appropriate design as per your case. 

The logic datatypes only take 0 and 1, thus no casting needed to assign 1'b0 to logic. The logic datatype is compatible with both Verilog and SystemVerilog. 

However, if you are using Modelsim, please ensure that you are using a SystemVerilog-2005 (or later) version, as earlier versions may not support the logic datatype. 

For SystemVerilog, logic datatype can be used only in SystemVerilog-2005 and later. If the SystemVerilog version is lesser than this, you have to use integer datatype. 

Please replace the "dff_p d1(do,di,clk);" with the appropriate D flip flop module. This block is a placeholder and should be replaced with the actual module instantiation. If the module does not exist, it needs to be created first.

Please verify the logic of the instantiated module. Modify the module according to your requirements.

Note: Make sure that the design is
