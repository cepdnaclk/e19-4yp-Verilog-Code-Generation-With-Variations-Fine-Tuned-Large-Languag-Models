```SystemVerilog
module AndOr (output X, Y, bit A, B, C);
assign #10 X = A & B;
assign #10 Y = B | C;
endmodule
```
This code will check the bit type in SystemVerilog. If the logic gate operations are performed correctly with bit type inputs, the output will be similar to the base Verilog code. If not, there may be an error in the logic gate operations which will be reported.

Please note that the bit type in SystemVerilog is a 1-bit wide bit vector type that can take only 0 or 1 as input. It is equivalent to Verilog's wire type and cannot be used for boolean logic operations as Verilog does. It's a concept from SystemVerilog specific to representing a single bit of data. 

The usage of bit type in SystemVerilog is generally discouraged for logical operations compared to Verilog as bit types could potentially introduce confusion and bugs. The bit type should be used for representing single bits of data rather than for logical operations. If you want to use bit type inputs for logical operations, consider using SystemVerilog's built-in integer types for arithmetic operations or SystemVerilog's boolean data type instead.

For this code to work, input values must be either 0 or 1. It can be tested by assigning values to A, B, and C within the testbench. But remember, Verilog doesn't have a bit type, it uses wire which can be 0 or 1. The change from wire to bit in SystemVerilog doesn't have much impact in logic design part. It's more about type safety and readability, which can help in preventing bugs related to data type. So, it's typically used in higher level languages such as SystemVerilog, while lower level languages like Verilog simply use wire.

Remember, SystemVerilog features are dependent on the specific version of DVS, which might not support all features. So, before using any new feature, make sure to check if it's supported by your specific version of DVS. 

In summary, the usage of bit type in SystemVerilog is not a standard, it's a concept from SystemVerilog language. It's more of a
