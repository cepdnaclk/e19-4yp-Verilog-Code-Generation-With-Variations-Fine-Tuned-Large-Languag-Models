```verilog
module example3(Data, Clock, Reset, RegSum, Sum);
input Clock, Reset;
input [3:0] Data;
output wire [3:0] Sum, RegSum;
wire [3:0] Sum, RegSum;
reg4 R1 (Sum, Clock, Reset, RegSum);
assign Sum = Data + RegSum;
endmodule
```

When changing the output to wire type array, we can test the compatibility of a wire type array with a module, such as `reg4`. This does not affect the result because a wire can be assigned to a wire type array. It is just a test to make sure the compiler doesn't throw any errors.

Note: This is not a recommended practice in Verilog. In Verilog, a wire is a continuous signal and a wire type array is not supported. So, it's better to use a wire to connect the output of a module to other signals.

Also note that in Verilog, a wire can be assigned to just like a regular signal. It's important to understand that the behavior is similar, but the result isn't the same. In Verilog, a wire is a continuous signal, not a single-cycle value. So, if you're using a wire for a long combinational path, you need to be aware of this. However, for simple combinational logic, such as in this example, the behavior is similar to a regular signal. The wire type array is not as useful in this case. As the task involves the sum of Data and RegSum where the RegSum is a sequence of consecutive register outputs. Hence, using a wire type array to assign the sum of registers to a wire was not necessary and was actually confusing.

If you're using a wire array for combinational logic, you should use an array of regs for the same purpose. Otherwise, using a wire would be appropriate. Be aware of this. This practice is not recommended in Verilog for a variety of reasons, but it's included here for completeness and understanding. 

In reality, the use of the wire type array could be seen as an unnecessary complication in some cases. If you're not using a wire type array for combinational logic, but you're using it for wire type assignments, then it's redund
