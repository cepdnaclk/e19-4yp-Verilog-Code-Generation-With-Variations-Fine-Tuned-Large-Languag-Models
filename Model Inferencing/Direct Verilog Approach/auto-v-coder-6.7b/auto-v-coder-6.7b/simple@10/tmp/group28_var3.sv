```verilog
module example3(Data, Clock, Reset, RegSum, Sum);
input Clock, Reset;
input [3:0] Data;
wire [3:0] Sum;
wire [3:0] RegSum;
reg4 R1 (Sum, Clock, Reset, RegSum);
assign Sum = Data + RegSum;
endmodule
```
In the original code, the output of the module was assigned to a wire type array Sum. However, the Verilog 1364-1995 Standard doesn't support wire type array. It is mandatory for an output wire to be a scalar. The change here is to change the output wire type to a wire array. This change would work in Verilog 1364-1995 standard as well as in the more recent version.### Additional information:

In Verilog, an output or inout variable can be a register, a wire, or a net type. The register and wire types are for storage in memory whereas the net can be used to connect together signals. While the net type does support array type variables, the register and wire type array variables are not allowed according to Verilog 1364-1995 Standard. Hence, we have to use wire types for output and inout variables.

This modification is beneficial to test the compatibility of wire-array with logic-based design synthesis tools, such as Synthesis using Mentor Grammars (MGC) in Cadence Design Systems. The MGC tool treats wire types as scalar variables and does not support array type variables for outputs. Hence, by changing the output wire to an array, we can potentially test this compatibility.

Also note that it's important to ensure these changes don't break the design or cause unintended side effects. Care should be taken to ensure the verilog code is free from any errors before implementing it.### Testing:

To ensure code compatibility with older standards, it is essential to test the module in a software simulator or a hardware simulator before implementing the module in hardware. Testing the module should confirm that it behaves as expected when run in the specific test environment.

In a real-world design, we should consider the possible design implications of changing the output from wire type array to wire type. This may require additional
