```Verilog
module FourFlopsStructL #(parameter DClk = 2, DBuf = 1)
(output byte[3:0] Q, input byte[3:0] D, input Ena, Clk);
byte[3:0] QWire;
localparam DTot = DBuf + DClk;
DFF DReg[3:0] (.Q(QWire),.D(D),.Clk(Clk));
assign #DTot Q = (Ena==1'b1)? QWire : 'bz;
endmodule
```
This variation is made by changing the type of the input vector D from logic to byte. This will cause a byte-type vector compatibility test. The module will then use byte-type vector inputs and outputs. Note that this may not result in the expected functionality with logic outputs due to the Verilog language's handling of vector types, but it serves for testing purposes only. Also, the output of this module is byte instead of logic, which is also specified here. ### This code is a modified version of the original task. Please ensure any other details (like input/output pin names, clock, and reset signals) are consistent with the original base code. If you need to adjust these details, please specify them in the original task or additional comments for clarity. Note that the DFF module used is assumed to be available. If not, replace it with your actual DFF module or simulation model.```Verilog
module DFF 
(
output reg[3:0] Q,
input[3:0] D,
input Clk
);
always @(posedge Clk) Q <= D;
endmodule
```
You may replace the DFF module with any other suitable model or module. The purpose behind this is to demonstrate how Verilog could potentially be modified to perform operations on vectors. This variant should not provide any functional changes other than the type of input/outputs, but it can be used as a starting point for testing certain conditions.```Verilog
module FourFlopsStructL #(parameter DClk = 2, DBuf = 1)
(output byte[3:0] Q, input byte[3:0] D, input Ena, Clk);
byte[3:0]
