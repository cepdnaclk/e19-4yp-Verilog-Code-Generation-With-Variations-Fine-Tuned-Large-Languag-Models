```verilog
module tst_dff_pbeh();
  logic di,clk;
  wire do;
  dff_p d1(do,di,clk); // Instantiate DFF with path delay
  initial begin clk=0; di=1'b0; #35 $stop; end // Initialize & stop
  always #3 clk=~clk; // Generate clock (negedges at 6, 12, 18...)
  always #5 di=~di; // Toggle data
  initial $monitor($time,"clk=%b, di=%b, do=%b",clk,di,do);
endmodule
```
This code tests a DFF module with logic declarations for di and clk, and instantiates the module with the declared signals. 

The initial block sets the initial values of clk and di, and stops the simulation at 35 time units. 

The always blocks generate a clock with negedge at each 6 time units and toggle the data with negedge at each 5 time units. 

The initial $monitor block prints out the current values of clk, di, and do after each time unit.

This testbench code can be tested against a DFF design in SystemVerilog. If the DFF design is correct and behaves as expected, you should see a positive edge on di and negative edge on clk leading to a positive edge on do. If this does not happen, you might have an error in your DFF design. 

Please note that these modifications are necessary because Verilog does not have the ‘logic’ type, and it does not support logic data types in SystemVerilog. It is better to write logic data types in SystemVerilog, as it is more strongly typed and more intuitive for the user.
