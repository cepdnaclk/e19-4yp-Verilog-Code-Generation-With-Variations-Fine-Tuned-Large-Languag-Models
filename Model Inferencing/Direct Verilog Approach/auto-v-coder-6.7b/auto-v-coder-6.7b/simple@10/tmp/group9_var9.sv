```verilog
module Problem8(input [3:0] a, b, output [3:0] diff, output [2:0] packed_output);
  wire [2:0] temp_out;
  assign diff = a - b;
  assign temp_out = {a,b,diff};
  assign packed_output = temp_out;
endmodule
```
In the modified code, a packed structure is created to include the signals a, b, diff, and this structure will be available to the output of the module. The temp_out is a wire to store the temporary output. The temp_out is assigned with the packed structure. When this code is run, the output will be a packed structure that includes a, b, and diff. The packed structure is assigned to the packed_output of the module.

This code snippet demonstrates the use of packed structures in Verilog. It shows how packed structures can be used to create complex structures that can then be assigned to the output of the module. This provides a way to handle multiple signals in a compact manner, making the code more readable and efficient. It also demonstrates the fundamental idea of verilog, where the output is a function of the inputs, and the inputs are defined by the module parameters.

Note: The packed_output will be assigned a packed structure. However, the packed structure can be further unpacked and used as per the specific needs of the design. Also, the packed structure in Verilog is different from the bitwise operations in C or other programming languages. This implies that the order of the elements in the packed structure is significant and cannot be changed in Verilog. In case of bit-by-bit operations, it is easy to re-order elements as needed.```verilog
module Problem8(input [3:0] a, b, output [3:0] diff, output [2:0] packed_output);
  typedef struct packed {
    logic [3:0] x;
    logic [3:0] y;
    logic [3:0] z;
  } packed_struct;
  
  packed_struct temp_out;
  assign diff = a - b;
  assign temp_out.x = a;
  assign temp_out.y = b;
  assign temp_out.
