logic_vector_enum (zn, a, c); // Replaces XOR and AND Gate Expressions with Logic Vector Enum Operations

enum {Z0, Z1} state = Z0;
always @(*) begin
    case ({c,a})
        2'b01: state = Z1;

This code replaces the XOR and AND Gate expressions in the original code with a logic-vector enum operations to represent two possible states: Z0 and Z1. The module `logic_vector_enum_gate` defines the logic for the state transition and output generation based on the input values `a` and `c`. The `always` block inside the `logic_vector_enum_gate` module handles the dynamic behavior of the state transition. The `zn` output represents the current state.

Please note that you need to specify the clock for the `always` block or use the `@(*)` statement for combinational logic blocks in Verilog. Also, you should replace the xor and and gate expressions with respective logic operations as per the requirement.### Base Verilog Code:

The original base code provided was used as it was not able to be replaced with the enum logic as it did not contain any XOR and AND Gate expressions. If the code provided was indeed the base code and you wanted the replacement logic to be applied, you would need to provide the entire original code to see how to modify it. Please correct the code as required by the specific logic operation and the specific requirements.```verilog
