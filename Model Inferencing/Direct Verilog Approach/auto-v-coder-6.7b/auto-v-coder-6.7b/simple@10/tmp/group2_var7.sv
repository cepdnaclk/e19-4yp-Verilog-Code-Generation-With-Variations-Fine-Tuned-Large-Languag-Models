```verilog
typedef struct packed {
    bit x;
    bit y;
    bit z;
} packed_sig;

module test;
  packed_sig signals;
  wire a;
  assign #25 a = 1;
  always begin
    #10 signals.x = a;
  end
endmodule
```
In this case, we're using packed structs to declare the signals as packed in the same way we would in Verilog (not in SystemVerilog though), so that they occupy a single bit. Then we use bitwise operators to assign values to the packed signals. The delays on the assignments are still applied as before. 

Remember that packed structs in SystemVerilog do not allow for bit-by-bit assignment, so in order to assign a bit to a bit-by-bit assignment in SystemVerilog, you would need to use bitwise operators. This modified code is valid in SystemVerilog.

In contrast, in Verilog, bit-by-bit assignment is not supported, so you can't do this. The code provided is for illustrative purposes only and will not compile in Verilog. The original code provided here is for demonstration of assigning a single bit to a signal with a delay in a Verilog module. 

Overall, verifying the packed struct handling depends on the context in which the code is used. If the code is meant to be used in a SystemVerilog environment and the signals are assigned bit-by-bit, this modified code should work. However, in case of Verilog, the original code is used as it would not compile due to the limitations of the language.```verilog
module test;
reg x, y, z;
wire a;
assign #25 a = 1;
always begin
    #10 x = a;
end
endmodule
