```verilog
module ha_1(s,ca,a,b,delays); 
  input a,b; 
  output s,ca;
  input delays;

  // Unpacked structure to hold the delays
  structure {int delay_xor, int delay_and} delays_s;
  assign delays_s = delays;

  xor #(delays_s.delay_xor) (s,a,b);
  and #(delays_s.delay_and) (ca,a,b);
endmodule
```
In this code, we have added a parameter `delays` of type `structure {int delay_xor, int delay_and}` to the port list of the module. This will be used to pass a value containing the delays to the module. The delays will be unpacked into `delays_s` inside the module.

Inside the module, the `xor` and `and` gates are parameterized with delays from `delays_s`. `delay_xor` and `delay_and` are used to specify the delay in `ns` using the parameterized delay `#(delay)`.

You can call this module with the unpacked structure as follows:
```verilog
ha_1 h1(s1,c1,a,b,{4,3}); // 4ns delay for xor and 3ns delay for and
```
This will instantiate a `ha_1` module with a delay of 4ns for the `xor` gate and 3ns for the `and` gate.

Note: The actual delay values used here are placeholders and can be replaced with actual delay values. Also, the unpacked structure needs to match the input structure. Ensure the structure of delays matches the input structure. If it's a packed structure, unpack it before using it.

The code is for Verilog language. The concept can be applied to other HDL languages as well. Please adjust the syntax accordingly.!

This modification allows for more flexibility in the delay values to be passed into the module without having to modify the code every time the delays change. The variation instruction provided can be used to modify the module's behavior based on the value of the delays.
