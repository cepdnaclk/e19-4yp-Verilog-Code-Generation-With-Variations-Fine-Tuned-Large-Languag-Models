```verilog
module SchedDelayA;
class ClassA;
    reg a, b;
    function new(input reg a, b);
        this.a = a;
        this.b = b;
    endfunction
    function reg get_a();
        return a;
    endfunction
    function reg get_b();
        return b;
    endfunction
    function void set_a(input reg a);
        this.a = a;
    endfunction
    function void set_b(input reg b);
        this.b = b;
    endfunction
endclass

ClassA obj = new(0, 0);
initial begin
    #10 obj.set_a(1);
    #20 obj.set_b(obj.get_a());
    #30 obj.set_a(obj.get_b());
    $display("%d %d", obj.get_a(), obj.get_b());
end
endmodule
```
In this variation, we have replaced the direct inputs `a` and `b` with a class `ClassA` where we have defined a `set_a` and `set_b` method to change the values of `a` and `b`. Similarly, we have defined `get_a` and `get_b` method to read the values of `a` and `b`. The object of class `ClassA` is initialized with `0, 0` and after that, using class methods, we're changing the values of `a` and `b` according to the logic provided. #20ms after initializing and before changing `a`, we're setting `b` to current value of `a`. After this, `a` is set to `b`, which again is the value of `a` after the last change. Finally, we display the values of `a` and `b` at the end. ### Note:
This is a basic example and does not simulate any real functionality or logic, it only serves to illustrate how a class handle could be used in Verilog. For the code to be fully functional, you would need to add additional code as per the requirement or need. Also note that the input/output pins of a Verilog module are connected to `reg
