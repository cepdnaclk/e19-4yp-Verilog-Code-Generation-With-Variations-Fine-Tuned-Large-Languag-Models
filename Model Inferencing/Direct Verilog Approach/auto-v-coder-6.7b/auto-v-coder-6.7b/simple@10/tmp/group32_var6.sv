```verilog
module Clock_Prog (input wire clk, input wire rstn, input wire [3:0] cnt);

typedef enum logic {RESETN_DEF, RESETN_NON_DEF} ResetType;

ResetType resetType = RESETN_DEF;

always @(posedge clk) begin
  if (rstn & cnt <= 4'd6) begin
    if (resetType == RESETN_NON_DEF) begin
      // Non-default reset case
    end else begin
      // Default reset case
    end
  end
end

// Rest of the module implementation

endmodule
```

In the above code, `ResetType` is declared as an enum having two possible states: `RESETN_DEF` and `RESETN_NON_DEF`. The default reset case is handled when the `rstn` is `1` and the counter `cnt` is less than or equal to `6`. The non-default reset case is handled when the `rstn` is `1` and the counter `cnt` is greater than `6`. This gives a good sense of testing both possibilities for `rstn`. 

Note that these are just illustrative examples, and the actual reset logic should be implemented according to the specific requirements of the hardware and software being tested. This modification is also assuming that `rstn` is active low. If it's an active high reset, the condition `if (rstn & cnt <= 4'd6)` should be replaced with `if (!rstn & cnt <= 4'd6)`.

This code is also assuming that `cnt` is a counter having integer values between 0 to 15. As per the condition `cnt <= 4'd6`, when `cnt` is 6, it is treated as `0` due to the nature of 4'd6 being a decimal number. This might not be the intended behavior, so be sure to adjust the logic according to your requirements.

Remember to add the reset input in the module port if it's not already declared in it. This way, the module will take `clk`, `rstn`, and `cnt
