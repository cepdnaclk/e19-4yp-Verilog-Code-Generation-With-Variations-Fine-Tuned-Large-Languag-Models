```Verilog
module testbench ();
generate
    struct {
        rand bit [3:0] data;
    } test_struct;
endgenerate

always @(test_struct.data)
    begin
        $display("Value of data inside struct %h", test_struct.data);
    end
endmodule
```
In this code, a struct is used to contain a rand member named 'data'. The randomization of 'data' can be done through SystemVerilog's randc method or randsequence that generate random values for the struct. The '$display' statement prints the value of 'data' inside the struct every time it changes. This can be used for debugging purposes to verify the randomized values.

Please note you may need to add `randc` to the struct definition to ensure the rand property. Also, make sure the testbench has the appropriate constraints or initial conditions to ensure that randomization can occur. If you would like to use randsequence, you can modify the code accordingly. 

The main point to remember is that in SystemVerilog, the generation of random numbers must be controlled by specific sequences. This is done by defining a randsequence and using the randc or randsequence directive. The `rand` keyword allows randomization of a variable or a set of variables. In this case, the `randc` directive was used to ensure that every execution of the testbench starts with a new random, non-consecutive value for the variable.

Also, please note that this code is only a simple example and may not be optimal for all use-cases. For more complex cases, you might need to define and drive constraints or sequences to achieve the desired randomization.```

If you want to modify the range of randomization, you can modify the data's range in the struct definition as shown below:

```Verilog
typedef struct {
    rand bit [7:0] data;
} test_struct;

initial begin
    test_struct s;
    assert (s.randomize() with {s.data inside {[0:255]};});
    $display("Value of data inside struct %h", s.data);
end
```

In the above code, the randomization is done with a range of
