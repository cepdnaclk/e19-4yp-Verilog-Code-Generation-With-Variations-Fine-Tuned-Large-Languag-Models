```verilog
module testbench ();
  generate data;
  process data;
endmodule
```
In this code, replace the struct construct with a struct containing a rand member.
```verilog
module testbench ();
struct {
  rand bit[7:0] var;
} data;
process data;
endmodule
```
In this modified code, the struct contains a rand member var of bit type. The randomization is performed by the rand keyword which is used to generate random values during simulation. If you are using a specific random number generator, you can use that instead of the rand keyword.

This code is a simple example to demonstrate the usage of rand in a struct in Verilog. Depending on the specific requirements, you may need to use other Verilog constructs, such as constraints or a random number generator during simulation. (#) A more complex example with constraints:

```verilog
module testbench ();
  struct {
    rand bit[7:0] var;
    constraint c { var > 5; var < 100; };
  } data;
  process data;
endmodule
```
In this modified code, the constraint on the variable var is set to be greater than 5 and less than 100. This constraint ensures that the var will have a random value within that range during simulation. If you need to test different randomization scenarios, you can make more complex constraints or use different random number generation mechanisms. (#) Example with a specific random number generator:

```verilog
module testbench ();
  struct {
    rand bit[7:0] var;
  } data;
  process data;
  
  initial begin
    data.var = $urandom_range(5,100); // Using $urandom_range() for randomizing 
  end
endmodule
```
In this modified code, the var value is randomized using a specific range function. It's important to note that verilog randomization is only used during simulation. In synthesis, the randomization is not applied.

Keep in mind that randomization in verilog can behave differently on different simulators, so the actual behavior of the randomization might not be consistent across different sim
