```verilog
module IR #(parameter WIDTH = 8, SIZE = 4)( input logic [WIDTH-1:0] data_in [0:SIZE-1], input logic load, clk,
output reg [WIDTH-1:0] data_out [0:SIZE-1] );
// Simple register (Instruction Register) loaded on posedge clk when load is high
always @( posedge clk )
if ( load ) data_out <= data_in;
endmodule
```

In this code, the `SIZE` and the `WIDTH` are parameters that can be adjusted according to the specific needs of the code. This means the module can work for different sized and width arrays. 

Furthermore, instead of the original single-dimensional array of `data_in` and `data_out`, we have a multi-dimensional array with the first dimension as a parameter. This means that for any instance of this module, the size of the array can be adjusted along with the size of its elements.

The code also uses the `always` block to load the data when the `load` signal is high. We set the output `data_out` equal to the input `data_in` when the `load` signal is high, effectively loading the `data_in` into `data_out`. This is a simple, but effective way of implementing a register in Verilog.

### Variation Notes:

1. The `load` signal is used to enable the loading of the `data_in` into `data_out`. This could be used to synchronize the data between different stages of the design.
2. The `SIZE` parameter is used to manage the size of the array, and the `WIDTH` parameter is used to manage the width or depth of the elements of the array.
3. The module uses packed 1-D arrays as inputs and outputs. Verilog supports handling of multi-dimensional arrays through these kinds of arrays.
4. The use of `reg` data type for the output is for signal compatibility with newer Verilog versions.
5. The `logic` data type is used to ensure that the inputs and outputs are compatible with all versions of Verilog.
6. In this code, when `load` is high, all elements of `data_out` will be assigned the
