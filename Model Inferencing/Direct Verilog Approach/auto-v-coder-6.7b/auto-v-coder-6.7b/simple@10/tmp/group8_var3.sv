```systemverilog
module IR ( input logic [1:0] A [0:3], input logic B, input load, clk,
output logic [1:0] data_out );
// Simple register (Instruction Register) loaded on posedge clk when load is high
always @( posedge clk )
if ( load ) data_out <= A[B];
endmodule
```
This modified code should work correctly if A is a 4-element array of width 2 bits and B is a one-bit input. The input B selects one of the elements in array A to be loaded into data_out on every positive edge of the clock if the load signal is high. If you want to use a different array or different type of inputs, you need to modify the code accordingly.

This code is a simple example of using packed arrays and a load signal to store and load bits into/from an array. The idea is to provide a simple, straightforward way to demonstrate the usage of multi-dimensional arrays and logic signals in a simple, yet useful verilog code snippet. Note that this is an example and may need to be adjusted to suit your particular use case.###

Keep in mind that handling of multi-dimensional arrays and logic signals in Verilog can be complex and sometimes may require advanced knowledge in hardware design. If you are new to this, it's recommended to refer to Verilog's documentation or seek help from a Verilog expert. 

Additionally, the code needs to be synthesized and implemented on a target device before it can be tested.###

Note: This code does not handle any error conditions. It assumes that the inputs are correctly formatted and the values within range. This is a basic concept and should not be used in production code. The error handling and edge case handling should be built into the system. 

It is recommended to use a testing framework that allows for random testing of the design to ensure reliability. 

This modifies the inputs from a simple 1D array to a 2D array and uses an additional bit B to select one of the 4 elements of the array. The element selected by B will be loaded into the data_out register on every positive edge of the clock. If you wish to modify the logic or type of inputs, this updated code can be adapted accordingly.
