```verilog
module example4(x1, x2, x3, x4, f, g, h);
input x1, x2, x3, x4;
output f, g, h;
wire g, h;
assign g = (x1 & x3) | (x2 & x4);
assign h = (x1 | x3) & (x2 | x4);
assign f = g | h;
endmodule
```
### Notes:
The wait(c) statement is replaced with a blocking assignment using a structure containing rand members. The rand member is randomized before the simulation begins and the blocking assignment is used to observe the behavior of the module based on the randomized values of the rand members. This modified code can be used to test randomizable structures.

```verilog
class my_class extends uvm_sequence_item;
  rand logic rand_value;
  
  function new(string name = "");
    super.new(name);
  endfunction
  
  virtual function string convert2string();
    return $sformatf(" rand_value=%0d", rand_value);
  endfunction

  function void pre_randomize();
    `uvm_warning("pre_randomize", "This function is called before the randomization is performed")
  endfunction

  function void post_randomize();
    `uvm_info("post_randomize", "This function is called after the randomization is performed", UVM_NONE)
  endfunction
endclass

// Testbench
module tb();
  my_class obj;

  initial begin
    obj = new();
    $display("Before Randomization: %s", obj.convert2string());
    obj.randomize();
    $display("After Randomization: %s", obj.convert2string());
    // In a real design, replace this wait statement with a blocking assignment or call another function
  end
endmodule
```
This version of code is still a basic example of a randomizable structure. In a real design, you would have multiple rand members and you might want to randomize them in specific or parallel ways, or create constraints to ensure the output of the design under test is within a certain
