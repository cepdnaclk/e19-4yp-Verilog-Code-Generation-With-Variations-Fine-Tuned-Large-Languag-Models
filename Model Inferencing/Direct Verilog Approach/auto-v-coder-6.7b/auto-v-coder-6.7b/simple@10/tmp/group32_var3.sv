module t_Clock_Prog ();
wire clock;

initial #100 $finish;
Clock_Prog M1 (clk, resetn, state);
endmodule

enum {START, STOP} state;
### What it Does:
This code snippet replaces the Resetn input with an enum'state' that has two values: START and STOP, with START as the default value. This makes the module more complex and allows for enum coverage testing, which is a common practice in Verilog/SystemVerilog design verification. The reset signal would typically be asserted in the start of the simulation and deasserted at the end.

Please note that this is very basic and doesn't cover all possible test scenarios. For realistic testing of a module with enums, more scenarios would need to be included.

Also, remember that the enums are not directly supported in Verilog, so if your tool doesn't support enums, you will have to manually convert them to binary or integer types.### Common Pitfalls:
- Not all tools support Verilog enums.
- Enum types are not supported in some synthesis tools, so you need to convert them to integer types or binary.
- Enum variables don't support increment or decrement operations, which makes them not suitable for many scenarios.
- Enum types can only have a maximum of 31 named states.
- Enum types are not recommended for hardware design, as they lead to non-deterministic behavior in combinational logic. In hardware design, binary or integer types are typically used. So, they are not recommended for this type of test.

Always double check whether your tools supports enum types or not. The correct usage may vary based on the tool or the language you are using. If you see warnings or errors during compilation, you may need to adjust the code accordingly for the given tool.

Lastly, Verilog is not designed for testing, it's designed for synthesis. Enum testing often comes through SystemVerilog, in which we can define enum types. If you're using Verilog, the enum testing could be done in a separate testbench and then use a stimulus generator to test different states. For this, enums and SystemVerilog is strongly recommended.```bash
