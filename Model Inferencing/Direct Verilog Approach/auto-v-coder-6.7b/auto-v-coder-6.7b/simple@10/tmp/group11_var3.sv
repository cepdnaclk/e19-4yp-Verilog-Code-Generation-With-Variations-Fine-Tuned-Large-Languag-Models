input ControlSignals;

// Declare structure
typedef struct packed {
   bit [7:0] Data;
   bit Control;
} DataPackage;

// Declare randomizable structure
DataPackage DataPackage_rand;

// Declare randomize method
method void randomize ();
   Data.rand_mode(1);
endmethod

// Call randomize method
initial begin
   DataPackage_rand = new();
   DataPackage_rand.randomize();
end

// Use the randomized data

assign ControlSignals = DataPackage_rand.Control;

endmodule
```
This code first declares a struct `DataPackage`, which is equivalent to the original struct `DataComponent`, but now with a rand member. It also declares a randomize method for `DataPackage` and a randomize instance `DataPackage_rand`. In the initial block, the `randomize` method is called to assign random values to `DataPackage_rand`. The `DataOut` and `ControlSignals` are then tied to the randomized values in the output ports of the module. Please note that this example uses the Verilog system tasks `rand_mode(1)` and `randomize()` for generating random values. These are part of Verilog's standard randomization APIs.

The `rand_mode(0)` would use deterministic randomization and the `rand_mode(1)` would use stochastic randomization.

Also note that the use of `new()` is needed to create an instance of the randomization class and assign it to the `rand` handle.

Finally, `new()` instantiates a new instance of the struct `DataPackage` and assigns it to `DataPackage_rand`.rand_mode(1);` is a method call on the instance of the randomization class `DataPackage_rand`, which allows the instance to use stochastic randomization.

This code can be used for testing and verifying the behavior of randomized data in Verilog constructs. This example is a minimal test
