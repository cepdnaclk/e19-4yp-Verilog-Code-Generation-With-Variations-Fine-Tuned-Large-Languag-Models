In this modified code, there is a `curr_state` which is a vector of `State` type. The `always` block is used to change the state based on the input `a` every positive edge of `c`. The output of the `mos_strength` module, `zn` and `zp` will be `St0` when `c` is high and `St1` when `c` is low. Note that the `State` type is a user-defined type similar to an enum in C or Python. This is to show how one can use logic vectors to simulate enum operations. This does not impact the original synthesis process. It is just meant to demonstrate testing an enum in a Verilog design. 

Also, please note that this is a simple demonstration of how to use this approach, and in a complex design, a more appropriate approach would be to use the enum type directly for representing the output states.

Please also remember to synthesize this code with a synthesis tool like Yosys or Icarus Verilog to get a netlist which can be simulated or used in a hardware design.

Finally, please understand this code is purely illustrative and does not represent the best way to design or implement such a system. This is meant to give
