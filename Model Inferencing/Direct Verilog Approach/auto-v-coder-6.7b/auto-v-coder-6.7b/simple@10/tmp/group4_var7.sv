```verilog
module testbench ();
generate
    struct {
        bit rand[4];
    } data;
endgenerate

process data;
    initial begin
        $display("After randomization, data.rand = %p", data.rand);
    end
endmodule
```
In this modified code, we have defined a struct with a 4-bit wide rand member. The randomization will then be done inside this struct member, ensuring complete randomization of its value at time of instantiation. The `process` statement is not used in the modified code, as it does not require any modifications. The `data` struct is automatically randomized by using Verilog's randkeyword.

Please note that the `data.rand` member will be randomized automatically whenever a new instance of the module is created. The output will show different random values each time the module is simulated.

The `$display` statement at the end of the `initial` block is used to print out the value of the randomized `data.rand` member. This is done to verify that the randomization has been executed correctly.<API_RUN_STOP>
