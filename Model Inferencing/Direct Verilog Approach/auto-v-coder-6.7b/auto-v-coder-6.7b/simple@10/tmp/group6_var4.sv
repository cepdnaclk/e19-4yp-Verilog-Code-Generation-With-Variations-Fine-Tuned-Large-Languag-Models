```verilog
module ALU ( input [7:0] a, b, input pass, add,
output logic [7:0] alu_out );
// Simple combinational ALU
always @(a or b or pass or add)
if (pass) alu_out = a;       // Pass input 'a'
else if (add) alu_out = a + b; // Add inputs 'a' and 'b'
else alu_out = 0;           // Default output is 0
endmodule
```
In this design, an ALU is implemented in Verilog. The inputs 'a' and 'b' are the two numbers to be operated on, 'pass' is a control signal to pass 'a' to the output, 'add' is a control signal to add 'a' and 'b', and 'alu_out' is the output of the ALU. The combinational logic inside the always @ block decides how the various inputs affect 'alu_out'. When 'pass' is asserted, 'alu_out' is set to 'a'. When 'add' is asserted, 'alu_out' is set to the sum of 'a' and 'b'. If neither 'pass' nor 'add' is asserted, 'alu_out' defaults to 0. This design is very simple, and does not do any exception handling or overflow detection. Its intended use is for learning and verification, not for real-world systems.

Please note that the above code is an example of a Verilog module. The actual functionality depends on the specific implementation and the use case. If the ALU needs to be made more complex or needs to detect overflow and other exceptions, additional logic will be needed. Also, this code assumes that the logic for the control signals ('pass' and 'add') is known before simulation. In a real-life system, these signals may come from some control unit or another part of the system. Such changes are beyond the scope of this example. ###

Also, using the `logic` keyword instead of `reg` is a common practice in modern Verilog code. The `logic` keyword is more precise and clear about the semantics of the signal, as it explicitly defines whether the signal is a register or a wire. Hence, to maintain compatibility with the IEEE Std 1800-2
