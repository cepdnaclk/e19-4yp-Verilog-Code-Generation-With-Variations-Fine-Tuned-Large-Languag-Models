2'b10: {q, q_b, q_mux_select} = {1'b0, 1'b0, 8'b00000100};

This code makes the outputs of the module more complex and could be useful in a design. For example, an output could be a bus that is used to drive a multiplexer or a complex combinational logic. The output `q_mux_select` is a `reg [7:0]` bus used to drive a multiplexer with four inputs, where each input is a `reg [7:0]` signal and the multiplexer selects one of these inputs as its output based on the input `d` in binary format.
Note:
This code will give an error in simulation because unpacked arrays (like `reg [7:0] q_mux_select`) may not be used as the right-hand side of an assignment statement outside of a non-blocking assignment (`<=`). It is also not possible to unpack a packed array at the left-hand side of an assignment in simulation. You will get an error. However, in synthesis, it should work fine.### Variation Instruction:
This time we'll create a new module which incorporates a delay for the output to demonstrate the 'wait' statement more clearly. Note that `wait` is
