```verilog
module XOR_Gate(
    input logic [1:0] A [0:3],
    output logic [1:0] Y [0:3]
);
    genvar i, j;
    generate
        for (i = 0; i < 4; i = i + 1) begin : test
            for (j = 0; j < 2; j = j + 1) begin : test_2
                assign Y[i][j] = A[i][j] ^ A[i][j];
            end
        end
    endgenerate
endmodule
```
This code modifies the input and output to work with a 4x2 array of logic vectors. The for-generate loop is used to iterate over each element of the array, and the XOR operator is used to calculate the output.

Please note that in Verilog, indexes are 0-based. The "input logic [1:0] A [0:3]" declares a 2-bit array A of size 4. The "output logic [1:0] Y [0:3]" declares a 2-bit output array Y of size 4.

This design can be tested in a Verilog simulator or in an FPGA. Make sure to define the size of the input and output arrays as per your specification. If you set the range of these arrays from "0" to "3" for a 4x2 array, you must also replace 4 and 2 in the `for` loop with 4 and 2 in this case. Also, make sure your Verilog simulator accepts multiple test cases and multiple test bench.

You can modify this code to test with different test cases as needed for testing. For example, you can add more test cases in the generate statement block to test with different inputs. 

Remember that the output array's size and index range must match the input array's size and index range.

NOTE: This is a simple design to demonstrate the idea of handling multi-dimensional arrays in Verilog. In more complex designs, you would have different inputs and outputs for each element in the arrays, and you would need to write a separate `XOR_Gate` module for each element in the arrays. This example is meant to be simple and concise, and
