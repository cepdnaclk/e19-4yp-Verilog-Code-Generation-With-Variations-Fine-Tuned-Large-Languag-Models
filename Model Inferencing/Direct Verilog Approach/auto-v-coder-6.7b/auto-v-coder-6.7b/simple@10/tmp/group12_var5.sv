```verilog
module Problem1(input [3:0] a, b, output logic[3:0] sum);
  always @ (posedge clk)
    sum <= a + b;
endmodule
```
Note: The above code is a SystemVerilog module. It is compatible with Verilog and it has a clocking aspect. This is a simple synchronous logic module with a clock input `clk`. When `clk` is asserted high (positive edge), the output `sum` is updated with the sum of the two inputs `a` and `b`. This is a very simple asynchronous assignment, but in real designs, the output would be updated whenever `a` or `b` changes.

If you want to test this code, you can use a simulation tool like ModelSim or Icarus Verilog. Make sure to compile your Verilog code with the appropriate parameters and flags to include these SystemVerilog features. 

Also, this code assumes that `clk` is declared as a logic type, which is a common practice in SystemVerilog.

In the original code, `sum` was declared as a reg type which is not the standard type in Verilog and Verilog doesn't support SystemVerilog features. The `sum = a + b;` line is a direct assignment, which means the output `sum` will take right before the next time step. `sum` will not be updated continuously when `a` or `b` changes. This is a synchronous behavior. 

In SystemVerilog, a continuous assignment is not recommended because it can lead to unexpected behavior without using the `always` keyword. The `always` statement in SystemVerilog executes its block of code continuously, which can lead to unexpected behavior if not used properly. This is not needed in your code because `sum` will be updated right before the next time step when `a` or `b` changes, which is the correct behavior in this case.

In the revised code, `sum` is declared as logic type to support SystemVerilog features. If you want to compile this with Verilog, you will need to add `-sv` flag to the command line. However, it's important to remember that Verilog does not fully support SystemVerilog features
