```verilog
module XOR_Gate(
    input logic [1:0] A [0:3],
    output logic [1:0] Y [0:3]
);
    always_comb begin
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) begin
            Y[i] = A[i] ^ A[i];
        end
    end
endmodule
```

This modified code handles each element of A separately and assigns them to the corresponding locations in Y. The inside operator `^` used here is a bitwise XOR operation and combines two bits (the elements of A) and returns 1 if exactly one of the two bits is 1. Otherwise, it returns 0. This is applied to the entire array of A and A, storing the results in Y.

Note: This code assumes that the dimensions of A and Y are the same and that each dimension is the same size (e.g., 4). If these assumptions are not true, the code will need to be adapted accordingly. 

Additionally, this code does not generate any synthesizable RTL (Register Transfer Level) code, but rather a combinational logic model.

It should be noted that this code doesn't perform any specific function and simply provides an example of how to handle multi-dimensional array handling in Verilog. The code may not be useful in synthesis or any other real-world application. The logic you would implement in a real-world application would be based on the specific requirements of the problem you are trying to solve.```verilog
module XOR_Gate(
    input logic [1:0] A [0:3],
    output logic [1:0] Y [0:3]
);
    always_comb begin
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) begin
            Y[i] = A[i] ^ A[i];
        end
    end
endmodule

This task will require the creation of a Verilog module that performs an XOR gate operation on each pair of inputs. This problem is more complex than a simple boolean operation like AND or OR, but it does not require any non
