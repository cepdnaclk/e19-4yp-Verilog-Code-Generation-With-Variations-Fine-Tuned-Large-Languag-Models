```verilog
module wire_assign( input bit in, output bit out );
    // assign out to in
    assign out = in;
endmodule
```
This code will create a module with an input of type bit and an output of type bit. The output will have the same value as the input. This is because the SystemVerilog `bit` type is similar to Verilogâ€™s `wire` type, but with a more restricted range: it can contain only 0 and 1. It's basically a single bit-sized value.

In this new version of the code, the input and the output will both be of the same type, and the output will be assigned the value of the input. This will allow for the testing and verification of the SystemVerilog `bit` type's functionality.

Please note that in SystemVerilog, a `bit` can be an implicitly declared as an individual bit in a packed array, or an individual bit in a struct, without a bit range or a bit select. It's worth noting that it's not possible to declare a `bit` in a non-packed array or a non-struct without using a bit range or a bit select. This limitation may be a limitation of the SystemVerilog language as it does not fully support bit-type variables in an array or struct.```verilog
// Declare an array of 4 bits
bit [3:0] four_bits;  // SystemVerilog bit range
// Declare a struct containing a single bit
struct { bit single_bit; } a_struct;

module wire_assign( input bit in, output bit out );
    // assign out to in
    assign out = in;
    // Test out the unpacked bit in an array and a struct
    assign four_bits = 4'b1010; // Allowed in SystemVerilog
    assign a_struct.single_bit = 1'b1; // Allowed in SystemVerilog
endmodule
