```verilog
module tst_dff_pbeh();
  logic di,clk;
  wire do;
  dff_p d1(do,di,clk);
  initial begin clk=0; di=1'b0; #35 $stop; end
  always #3 clk=~clk;
  always #5 di=~di;
  initial $monitor($time,"clk=%b, di=%b, do=%b",clk,di,do);
endmodule
```
The above code will be the same as the original, with the exception that it will now support SystemVerilog types. This will be useful in more complex designs where you may want to handle variables as logic or integer. If you're writing in Verilog for synthesis, you don't need to worry about these changes. If you're writing in a SystemVerilog environment, you could include this functionality for better compatibility. This code is also fully synthesizable. 

Please make sure that your Verilog simulator supports SystemVerilog. The standard Verilog simulator doesn't support SystemVerilog. If you're using modelsim or verilog-simulator, you can run the code by converting the verilog file into a.sv file and then using the -sv switch to run the simulation.

Note: SystemVerilog is not fully compatible with Verilog. For larger projects, it is recommended to use SystemVerilog code. However, if you want to stick to basic Verilog, the changes are minimal and can be made as per the original code. The only difference is the change in the reg declarations to logic. The behavior of the module will remain the same as the original code. This approach is more compatible with the Verilog standard and widely used in legacy designs.
