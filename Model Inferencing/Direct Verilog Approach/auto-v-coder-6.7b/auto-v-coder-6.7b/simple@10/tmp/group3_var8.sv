```verilog
module full_adder(i1, i2, cin, sum, cout);
input i1, i2, cin;
output sum, logic cout;
assign sum = i1 ^ i2 ^ cin;
assign cout = (i1 & i2) | (cin & (i1 | i2));
endmodule
```
Note:
`logic` datatype in Verilog is a data type for digital logic signals, which can hold 0, 1, or 'X'. This is equivalent to the `bit` datatype in SystemVerilog, which can hold 0, 1, or 'Z' (or 'X' if the signal is tri-state). Verilog's `wire` datatype can also hold 'Z', but it's not used as much as `logic`.

The reason you would want to use `logic` instead of `wire` is to maintain compatibility with SystemVerilog for design synthesis. Verilog allows mixed languages and so, it may be beneficial to use `logic` when porting designs between languages to maintain consistency. However, in some cases, using `wire` can provide performance benefits such as smaller encoded bitstream, less area for inverters, and less power consumption.

In summary, the type choice depends on the specific requirement of the design, but it is recommended to use `logic` for digital logic and `wire` for communication with other modules or in combination with `assign` for synthesis. In general, to maintain consistency and compatibility, use `logic` and keep in mind that `wire` is more flexible in logic design.<API_RUN_START>```verilog
