```verilog
module Clock_Prog (
    input wire clock,
    input reg [1:0] resetn, // Modified to use enum
    output reg [31:0] counter
);

// Enum for resetn
typedef enum logic [1:0] {
    Resetn_None,
    Resetn_Default,
    Resetn_NonDefault
} Resetn_t;

always @(posedge clock or negedge resetn[0]) begin
    if (!resetn[0]) begin
        counter <= 0;
    end else begin
        counter <= counter + 1;
    end
end

initial begin

    $dumpvars;
end

In this modified code, the Resetn input is changed from a regular wire to a register of bitwidth 2. This allows for the use of enums to represent the different states of resetn, thereby enabling enum-based coverage testing. Also, the enum is used in the sensitivity list for the always block, and the resetn[0] is the only condition for the if statement in the always block.

Please replace the Clock_Prog with your module name. This will generate a VCD file which you can use with GTKWave or similar waveform viewers to visualize the signals.

This modification allows for better coverage of the design when testing reset signals using enum coverage. It makes the design more robust and testable by allowing for both the none and default reset states. However, remember testing any design can be tough and should be conducted well in combination with other methods and tools.```verilog
