```Verilog
module latch (input d, c, output reg [7:0] q, q_b );
always begin
wait ( c );
q = d;
q_b = ~d;
end
endmodule
```
In this modified code, we've changed the output declaration from `output reg q, q_b` to `output reg [7:0] q, q_b` to allow the usage of 8-bit values for q and q_b. We also adjusted the code to assign the correct values to q and q_b based on the input d.

Note: This code will only compile if the d input is a 8-bit value. If it's a 1-bit value, the output will be a 1-bit value, and so on. The `reg [7:0]` declaration allows for 8-bit output values.

This code does not demonstrate the true power of Verilog's packed union declarations as it does not introduce a 'union' but rather a simple parallel assignment of q and q_b based on the value of d. It also does not implement any kind of latch behavior. For a true latch behavior, we would need to use Verilog's latch primitives or state machines.

In a real-world application, you would likely want to use a latch primitive like `always @(posedge c) begin q <= d; q_b <= ~d; end` to create a latch behavior.

Remember that packed union outputs are typically used to share a multi-bit bus among multiple modules and should be used sparingly as they can be difficult to debug and reason about. They should be used when the multiple outputs need to be written to in a coordinated manner to avoid race conditions.

It is best to use packed union output when the signals are used in the same module or there is high control over the timing involved. For all other cases, we should typically use different wire signals to handle the outputs.

Also, verify if the values of q and q_b are really expected based on the input d. If it is not as expected, it may be due to a mistake in the test bench or logic design.```Verilog
