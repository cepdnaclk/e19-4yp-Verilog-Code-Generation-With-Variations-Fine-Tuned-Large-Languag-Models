```verilog
module t_Clock_Prog ();
wire clock;

initial #100 $finish;
Clock_Prog M1 (clk, reset);

reg [1:0] reset = 2'b01;
endmodule
```
In this modified code, we replaced the reset input with a 2-bit register (`reset`) initialized to the value 2'b01 (which is binary representation of decimal 3). This `reset` signal serves the same purpose as the original resetn input in the Clock_Prog module.

Please note that the exact behavior of `reset` signal will depend on whether it is used in the Clock_Prog module to reset the system or to reset the clock. The usage of `reset` signal is not specified in the original code snippet. As such, the specific role of this signal in the module needs to be carefully confirmed in the system under test (SUT) to ensure that the enum coverage is being correctly tested.

Also, this is a simple example of enum coverage. In real-world applications, there might be multiple types for the reset signal and they may be used in a different way, so you would need to test each case as per the specific reset scheme of the module. This might involve some sort of testbench code too.

Please remember to replace the Clock_Prog and clk with the actual module and inputs used in your system. Also, in a real-world scenario, you should have a comprehensive testbench where you can control the test vectors.

If you are using SystemVerilog, the `enum` can be included in the module's interface to make it more structured, readable and maintainable. Here's an example of how you might use it:

```verilog
module Clock_Prog (input clk, input reset, input [1:0] reset_type);
// reset_type is an enum with two possible values - default and non-default

always @ (posedge clk) begin
    if(reset_type === 2'b00)
        $display("Reset to default state");
    else
        $display("Reset to non-default state");
end
endmodule
```

In this code, `reset_type` can be used to control the behavior
