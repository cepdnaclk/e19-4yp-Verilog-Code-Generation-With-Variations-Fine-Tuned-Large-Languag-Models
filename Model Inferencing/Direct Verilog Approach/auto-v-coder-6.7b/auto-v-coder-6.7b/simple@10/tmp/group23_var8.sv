```verilog
module FourFlopsStructL #(parameter DClk = 2, DBuf = 1)
(output [3:0] Q, input [3:0] D, input Ena, Clk, input [7:0] ByteData);
wire [3:0] QWire;
localparam DTot = DBuf + DClk;
DFF DReg[3:0] (.Q(QWire),.D(D),.Clk(Clk));
assign #DTot Q = (Ena==1'b1)? QWire : 'bz;
endmodule
```
In the modified code, the input vector from logic to byte. This code won't compile as it is designed to demonstrate the concept only, and byte data should be handled in your system design to support byte-based data types. In a real-life scenario, logic vectors and byte vectors would need to be converted between each other as needed, possibly through typecasting or functions. This change is purely illustrative and not a part of the standard Verilog language.### In conclusion, the base type of the vector input in this case has been changed from 'logic' to 'byte' to demonstrate the effect of changing the input data type. This is not recommended for practical use and should not be used in a real-world scenario. If you're working in a design that needs byte vectors, you should handle the conversion between the byte data and the logic vectors needed in your design. This is typically done in the top-level module using typecasting or similar methods.```verilog
