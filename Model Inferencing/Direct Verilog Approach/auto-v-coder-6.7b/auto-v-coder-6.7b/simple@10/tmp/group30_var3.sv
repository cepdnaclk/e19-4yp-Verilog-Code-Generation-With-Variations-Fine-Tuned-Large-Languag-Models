```verilog
module netdelay2(x,y);
input x;
output [31:0] y;
wire #(2,1) nn; // Declare wire 'nn' with rise=2, fall=1 delay
not (nn,x); // Assign NOT(x) to 'nn' (takes effect after rise/fall delay)
assign y=nn; // Assign 'nn' to 'y' (direct assignment)
endmodule
```

This modified code declares a `y` output packed array with 32 fields to represent different output states. The delay is still applied as in the original code. The NOT operation is applied to `x` and the result is assigned to `y`. The output result will be a 32-bit binary where each bit represents the output state of the 32 fields. 

Remember to synthesize and run the simulation to check the functionality of the modified code. The simulation should indicate that the output changes with respect to the input `x` as expected.

Please note: The delay of 2,1 could be adjusted based on the requirement of the specific circuit being simulated. In this example, it is not clear where the delay comes from. The delay is used during the simulation to simulate different propagation times. This could be the time it takes for a signal to rise or fall, but it may not be accurate in a real circuit where the rise and fall times are shorter. The `#` symbol is used to signify a delay in the simulation, not in the hardware implementation. In a hardware implementation, delays are determined by the technology being used such as 0.1nm or 0.35nm. 

Also, the rise and fall time for a NOT gate is typically 0.15-0.20ns (rise), 0.19-0.24ns (fall), but modern technology introduces more complexities which can introduce additional errors. Hence, in a real circuit, we do not have a 2,1 delay as it's not realistically achievable. 

For a real-world circuit, you might want to look at how the technology handles the operations (NOT operation) rather than trying to artificially delay them. Delays should be tuned for the specific technology in use. In general, delay should be as short as possible without causing
