```verilog
module tst_alu1();
  reg [3:0]a,b; reg[1:0] f; reg cci; wire[3:0]d; wire co;
  alu_1 aa(d,co,a,b,f,cci); // Instantiate ALU
  initial begin cci=1'b0; f=2'b00; a=4'h1; b=4'h2; #30 $stop; end // Initialize & stop
  always begin // Apply stimulus
  end
  initial $monitor($time, " cci = %b, a= %h,b = %h,f = %b,d =%h,co= %b ",cci,a,b,f,d,co); // Use %h
endmodule
```
This variation increases sensitivity by including the ALU in its own testbench and testing its behavior with multi-bit inputs. In this scenario, I have used `#30 $stop;` to stop the simulation after 30 time units. The ALU is tested by changing the inputs `a`, `b`, and `f`. You can replace the `#30 $stop;` with your own simulation time stop condition. 

The `initial $monitor(...);` line will emit trace data to the standard output every time the simulation changes a value in the `$monitor`. This is used to monitor the status of the ALU after every change in the inputs. Note that `$monitor(...);` statement should be inside an always block for continuous output.

Remember to replace `alu_1 aa(d,co,a,b,f,cci);` with your ALU module name if different.

Also, the input `cci` is used in the ALU design, so you might want to also test that behavior. Note that `cci` is controlled externally and not used in the ALU module itself. You might want to include test cases with and without `cci` as 1 and 0 depending on the behavior of your ALU.

Also, be sure that the ALU module is synthesizable or else it may not pass the test in a simulator. The synthesizable verification must be done by the synthesis
