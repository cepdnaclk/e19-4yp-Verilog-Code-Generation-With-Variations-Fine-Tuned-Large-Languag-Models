```systemverilog
module AndOr #(
    parameter ADDR_WIDTH = 8
) (output logic X, Y, input bit A, B, C);
assign #10 X = A & B;
assign #10 Y = B | C;
endmodule
```
In the new code, bit A, B, C, and X, Y are declared as bit variables. This variation demonstrates the functionality of the original code, but using a SystemVerilog bit type for the inputs and output instead of Verilog wire type.

The parameter ADDR_WIDTH is defined to test the use of module parameters in SystemVerilog. In this case, it's not used, but it's included in the module definition for completeness.

Please note that while this variation is syntactically correct, it's not recommended for use in real-world coding. Verilog is more commonly used for digital design, and there are better methods in SystemVerilog to do the same thing (like using types like logic and integer for example). However, this is a learning exercise and serves to demonstrate the use of bit type in SystemVerilog.###

Please also note that bit is not the same as logic. bit is a 1-bit wide variable, while logic is a 1 or 0 value. They are used interchangeably in simple designs, but in complex circuits it might be necessary to use logic or more complex data types.

We use `'b0` or `'b1` to represent bit values as in 'b101. However, when using 'b1, it represents a bit and not a number. The `logic` data type in SystemVerilog is useful when you want to define a variable with a specific width, e.g., `logic [3:0] a`. In this case, `a` is a vector that can hold 4 bits. This is a lot more flexible than using bit for simple designs.

Keep in mind that this code does not do anything useful as it will not change the outputs depending on the inputs, and the delay assignments are not useful for any real design. They're used here for learning purposes.###

The delay in the assignments #10 is set to 10, which is the time in nanoseconds for a 50MHz design. In most
