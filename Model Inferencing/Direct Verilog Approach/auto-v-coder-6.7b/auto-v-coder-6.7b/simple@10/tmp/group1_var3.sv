// Verilog code for Problem 4
module XOR_Gate(
    input logic [1:0] A [0:3],
    output logic [1:0] Y [0:3]
);
    genvar i;
    generate
        for(i = 0; i < 4; i = i + 1) begin: inside_loop
            assign Y[i] = A[i] ^ {~A[i][1], ~A[i][0]};
        end
    endgenerate

In this modified version, the inputs A are a 2D packed array of logic-vectors, and the output Y is also a 2D packed array of logic-vectors. The inside loop iterates over each element of the input and calculates the bitwise XOR of each bit with its complement in the output. This ensures that the output is a 2D packed array of logic-vectors. Note that this XOR operation is technically a bitwise NOR operation, which is equivalent to the bitwise NOT of the bitwise XOR of the input A and the complement of A. This modified code can be used to test the handling of multi-dimensional logic-vector arrays in Verilog.

The logic statement Y[i] = A[i] ^ {~A[i][1], ~A[i][0]} directly calculates the bitwise XOR of each bit of the input with its complement, and then assigns the result to the output Y[i]. In this way, the output is a 2D packed array of logic-vectors. This modification demonstrates how to extend the XOR gate to handle multi-dimensional logic-vector arrays. 

Please compile, simulate, and test this modified code to ensure it works as expected with Verilog. If necessary, revise the code based on the simulation results.```verilog
