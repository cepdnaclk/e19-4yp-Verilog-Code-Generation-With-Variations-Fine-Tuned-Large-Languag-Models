```
module Problem1(input logic [3:0] a, b, output logic [3:0] sum);
  assign sum = a + b;
endmodule
```
This change ensures that the module is compatible with SystemVerilog types and can be easily adapted into a SystemVerilog project. The assignment of sum to a + b ensures the correct functionality of the module. It can handle four-bit binary numbers and perform addition. The modified code should work similarly in SystemVerilog as it did in Verilog.### Compatible Code:
```
module Problem1(input logic [3:0] a, b, output logic [3:0] sum);
  assign sum = a + b;
endmodule
```
The verilog-to-systemverilog directives are used to convert the Verilog code into SystemVerilog.
```
  `default_nettype none
  `include "uvm_macros.svh"
  
  module Problem1(input logic [3:0] a, b, output logic [3:0] sum);
    assign sum = a + b;
  endmodule
```
The code above will correctly compile into a SystemVerilog module. This directive also ensures that no warnings are issued when the code is compiled. The `default_nettype none` statement ensures that no unwanted implicit nets are created in the design. This module can handle four-bit binary numbers and perform addition. The direct `$display()` statement in the module's body will also not be synthesizable in SystemVerilog and thus, should be removed. It was added for debugging purposes in Verilog.### Testbench Compatible Code:
```
module Problem1_test;

  logic [3:0] a, b, sum;

  initial begin
    a = 4'b1001;
    b = 4'b0110;
    
    $display("Result: %b", sum);
  end
  
  // Instantiate the DUT
  Problem1 dut (
   .a(a),
   .b(b),
   .sum(sum)
  );

endmodule
```
The above code is a testbench for the given design. It sets the input values for a
