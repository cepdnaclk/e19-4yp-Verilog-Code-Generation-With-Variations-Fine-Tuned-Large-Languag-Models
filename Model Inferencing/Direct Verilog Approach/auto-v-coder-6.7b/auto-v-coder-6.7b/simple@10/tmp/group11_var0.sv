```verilog
module DataComponent (DataIn, DataOut, ControlSignals);
input [7:0] DataIn;
output [7:0] DataOut;
input ControlSignals;

// Declare a struct for data
typedef struct packed {
    bit [7:0] data;
} DataStruct;

// Instantiate a struct
DataStruct data_struct;

// Assign random values to the struct
initial begin
    data_struct.data = $random;
end

// Drive the output based on control signals
always @(*) begin
    if(ControlSignals) begin
        DataOut = data_struct.data;
    end else begin
        DataOut = DataIn;
    end
end

endmodule
```

This code adds a struct to represent the data with a rand member, and it assigns a random value to this struct's member during simulation. The output is driven based on the ControlSignals input. If ControlSignals is high, Output is driven from the randomized data struct's member. Otherwise, it drives from the input DataIn.

Please note that the synthesis tool will not create the required logic in the output based on the ControlSignals. This is just verification on a simulation level.

In a real-world scenario, you would add appropriate logic to drive the output based on the ControlSignals at synthesis time. In Verilog, you would typically use a conditional statement to drive the output logic based on the value of ControlSignals. This could involve creating a mux with a condition that connects DataOut to the DataIn input if ControlSignals is low, and to the output of a register or buffer connected to the data_struct.data input if ControlSignals is high. However, the given code does not cover that. 

Also, this code is a simplification. In a real-world scenario, you would have a complex combinational logic that uses more signals, and possibly more complex logic for when ControlSignals is high. In that case, the synthesis tool, when converting the RTL into a netlist for real hardware, will need more details about the logic than are provided in this code snippet. Hence, the verification code remains the same.```verilog
