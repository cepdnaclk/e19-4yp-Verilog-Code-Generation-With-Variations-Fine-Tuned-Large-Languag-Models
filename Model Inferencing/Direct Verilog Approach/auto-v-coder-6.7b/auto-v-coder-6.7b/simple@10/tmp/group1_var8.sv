```verilog
module XOR_Gate(
    input logic [1:0] A [0:3],
    output logic Y
);
    always_comb begin
        Y = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) begin
            Y = Y ^ A[i][0] ^ A[i][1];
        end
    end
endmodule
```

In this modified code, A is an array of 4 2-bit logic vectors. The outside operator is used to iterate over each element in the array. For each element, the inside operator is used to access both bits of the 2-bit logic vector. This results in an XOR operation combining the two bits. The result of this operation is then XORed with the previous results, and the final result is assigned to Y.

Note that the inside operator is used with the index i (0...3) to access the elements of the 2-bit array A. If there was a need to access the elements by name (e.g., A[0][0]), the inside operator would not be necessary. In that case, the Verilog code would require different syntax. The above code is more concise and uses the inside operator.

Remember that this code does not create a 2D array, instead it's an array of packed 1D logic-vector arrays. Verilog flattened these arrays which means that each of 4 elements is a 2-bit vector (2 bits can represent 4 different values).

Similarly, the XOR operation will result in a 2-bit output. To get the bit-level output, you might need to use bit-slice operations or additional level of XOR gates.
