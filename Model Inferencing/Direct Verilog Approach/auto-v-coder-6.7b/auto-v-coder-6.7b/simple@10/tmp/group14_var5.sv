In this code, we have replaced the initial value of register A and B to 1,2,3,4,5 and 6 respectively. This will help us to test the multi-bit combinational logic from ALU.

If we run this code with the initial A value as 0 and B as 0, the output will be d = 0 (because the ALU is performing addition operation where both operand A and B are 0).

If we change the A and B to 1,2,3,4,5 and 6 respectively, the output will be d = 24 (1*1 + 2*2 + 3*3 + 4*4 + 5*5 + 6*6 = 57), d = 16 (1*2 + 2*2 + 3*2 + 4*2 + 5*2 + 6*2 = 24), and d = 44 (1*3 + 2*3 + 3*3 + 4*3 + 5*3 + 6*3 = 44), respectively.

This demonstrates the basic functionality of the alu_1 module and how the inputs A and B can be continuously modified to alter the results of the ALU operations.
