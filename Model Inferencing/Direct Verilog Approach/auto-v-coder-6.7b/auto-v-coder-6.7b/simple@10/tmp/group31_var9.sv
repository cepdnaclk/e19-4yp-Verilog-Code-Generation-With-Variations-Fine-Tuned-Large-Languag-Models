module func1(x1, x2, x3, f);
input x1, x2, x3;
output logic signed f;
assign f = (~x1 & ~x2 & x3) | (~x1 & x2 & ~x3) | (x1 & ~x2 & x3) | (x1 & x2 & ~x3);
endmodule

### Variation Explanation:
- The output type was modified from logic (which represents unsigned logic vectors) to logic signed (which represents signed logic vectors). This is done to demonstrate the different behavior of signed and unsigned logic vectors in Verilog.
- The truth table for the expression (~x1 & ~x2 & x3) | (~x1 & x2 & ~x3) | (x1 & ~x2 & x3) | (x1 & x2 & ~x3) remains the same for both unsigned and signed logic vectors. But their interpretation and potential range of values differ.

For unsigned logic vectors, the value is the integer equivalent of its logic binary representation (0 for '0' and 1 for '1').
- For signed logic vectors, the value is the integer equivalent of its logic binary representation (0 for '0' and -1 for '1').

Therefore, the output values of signed logic vectors will cover the full range of possible binary representation for negative and positive integers, whereas the output values of unsigned logic vectors will only cover positive integers.

This modification should be done for understanding the concept of signed logic vectors in Verilog. In practice, in most cases, it's better to use unsigned logic vectors for better performance and readability. However, this example exists for illustrating the difference between signed and unsigned logic vectors.###EEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFFEEEEFF
