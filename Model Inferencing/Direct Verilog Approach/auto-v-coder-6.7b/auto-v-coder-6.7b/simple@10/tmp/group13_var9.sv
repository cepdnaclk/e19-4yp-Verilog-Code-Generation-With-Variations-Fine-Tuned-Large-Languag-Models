```Verilog
// Verilog code for Problem 5
module Half_Adder(
    input A, B,
    output logic [7:0] Sum, Carry
);
    assign {Carry, Sum} = {A, B} ^ {B, A};
endmodule
```
In this modified code, the output `Sum` and `Carry` are declared as a 8-bit wide vector. The logic operator `^` performs the XOR operation on each pair of bits from `{A, B}` and `{B, A}`, effectively performing the bitwise operations 'XOR' and 'AND' operations on the operands. The result is assigned to the `Carry` and `Sum` signals. Note that we use the assignment expression to assign the 8-bit result at once. This is equivalent to declaring the bitwise operations on each individual bit of the `Sum` and `Carry` signals individually before assigning the final result.

Please note that this code is meant for general demonstration purposes and it may not be the most efficient implementation for a half adder. For a more efficient implementation, consider using structural Verilog or using Verilog's predefined operator for bit-wise operations.

```Verilog
// Verilog code for Problem 5
module Half_Adder(
    input A, B,
    output logic [7:0] Sum, Carry
);
    always_comb begin
        Sum[0] = A ^ B;
        Carry[0] = A & B;
        for(int i=1; i<8; i=i+1) begin
            Sum[i] = 0;
            Carry[i] = 0;
        end
    end
endmodule
```
This code is more verbose and should be used when you need to understand the logic of a half adder.

The `always_comb` block is a process that runs at the combinational logic level of the design and its sensitivity list is empty, meaning that it is triggered whenever any of the input signals change. This is a common practice for combinational circuits that have a large combinatorial complexity.

Remember to replace `logic [7:0]` with `wire [7:0]` in your actual code if you are not
