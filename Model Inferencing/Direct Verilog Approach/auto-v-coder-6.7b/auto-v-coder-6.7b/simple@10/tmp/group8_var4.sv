```verilog
module IR ( input [7:0] data_in [0:3], input [1:0] index, input load, clk,
output reg [7:0] data_out );
// Simple register (Instruction Register) loaded on posedge clk when load is high
always @( posedge clk )
if ( load ) data_out <= data_in[index];
endmodule
```
In this modified code, data_in[] is now an array of 4 elements, each of which is a 8-bit logic vector. The input index is a 2-bit vector that defines which element of data_in[] to select. When load is high, the value of the element at the index index in data_in[] is assigned to data_out. This variation allows for handling multiple elements within a 1D array. Note that 4 is used as the upper limit of the range on array indexing: it represents the total number of elements in the array. Also, make sure to use correct index value in a way that it doesn't exceed the size of the array. 

The use of an inside operator on a 2D array ensures that the index is in range for the array, and the inside operator is used in this case to ensure that the index falls within the valid range. 

Lastly, the module should be instantiated as follows:
```verilog
wire [7:0] data_out;
IR IR_inst (.data_in(data_in),.index(index),.load(load),.clk(clk),.data_out(data_out));
```
In the instantiation, ensure that the correct inputs to the module are connected to the correct input ports. This is done by connecting the 2D logic array data_in to the module's data_in input, the index input to the module's index input, and so on. The output from the module is finally connected to the output data_out. Ensure to replace data_in, index, load, clk, data_out with the correct port names in your testbench. 

This code should help in handling a 2D or multi-dimensional array in a Verilog module.```verilog
