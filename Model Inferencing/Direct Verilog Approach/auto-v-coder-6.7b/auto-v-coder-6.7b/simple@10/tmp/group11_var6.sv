```verilog
module DataComponent (DataIn, DataOut, ControlSignals);
input [7:0] DataIn;
output [7:0] DataOut;
input ControlSignals;

typedef struct {
    rand bit [7:0] myData;
} myDataStruct;

myDataStruct myStruct;

initial begin
    myStruct = new;
    myStruct.randomize();
    DataOut = myStruct.myData;
end

endmodule
```
Randomization is performed at the start of the simulation, then DataOut is assigned the randomized myData value.### Note:
The randomization is performed only once at the beginning of the simulation. If you want to randomize again, you need to call the myStruct.randomize() inside an event or a function. This variation is just a simple demonstration to showcase the use of randomization in Verilog. In a real application, you probably want to call randomization in some sort of event.```verilog
module DataComponent (DataIn, DataOut, ControlSignals);
input [7:0] DataIn;
output [7:0] DataOut;
input ControlSignals;

typedef struct {
    rand bit [7:0] myData;
} myDataStruct;

myDataStruct myStruct;

initial begin
    myStruct = new;
    myStruct.randomize();
    DataOut = myStruct.myData;
end

always @(ControlSignals) begin
    if (ControlSignals) begin
        myStruct.randomize();
        DataOut = myStruct.myData;
    end
end

endmodule
```
In this modified code, randomization is performed every time ControlSignals changes its state. If ControlSignals is asserted, the DataOut is set to a new random value. This introduces a small degree of randomness into the data output.```verilog
module DataComponent (DataIn, DataOut, ControlSignals);
input [7:0] DataIn;
output [7:0] DataOut;
input ControlSignals;

typedef struct {
    rand bit [7:0] myData;
} myDataStruct
