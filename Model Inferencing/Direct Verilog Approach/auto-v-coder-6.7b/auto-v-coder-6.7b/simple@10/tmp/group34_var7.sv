```verilog
// Create a module with one input and one output that behaves like a wire
module wire_assign( input wire in,
                    input wire [7:0] [7:0] in_array,
                    output wire [7:0] [7:0] out_array );
    // assign out to in
    genvar i, j;
    generate
        for (i = 0; i < 8; i++) begin
            for (j = 0; j < 8; j++) begin : inner_loop
                assign out_array[i][j] = in_array[i][j];
            end
        end
    endgenerate
endmodule
```

In the Verilog code above, the input 'in' is a wire that connects to the output 'out'. The input Clock is a wildcard-indexed associative array of type [7:0][7:0] in_array. The assignment from the input array to the output array is accomplished using a nested loop that iterates through each index of the array. The output array is also a wildcard indexed array. Note that this code does not handle the uninitialized input variables, so you need to ensure that they are properly initialized before using them with wildcard-indexed association arrays.

The 'inside' operator is not applicable to arrays, so the above code does not use it. Wildcard indexing is the recommended approach to access elements in a dynamic array in Verilog. The above code is structured in a way to use a loop for each index to assign values from the input array to the output array. This is a more traditional and straightforward way to handle dynamic arrays in Verilog.

Keep in mind that Verilog requires explicit declaration of arrays with unknown size. In this case the size of the array is known, but it is good practice to write code that works with arrays of unknown size. In general, it's good to assume that the input arrays may be larger than 8x8. This way, it will still work as expected even if the input array has more elements than 8x8.

Please remember to test code with a variety of clock signals to ensure that it properly handles wildcard indexing and the proper assignment of values. This code serves as a basic implementation, and as such it probably performs its function correctly and does
