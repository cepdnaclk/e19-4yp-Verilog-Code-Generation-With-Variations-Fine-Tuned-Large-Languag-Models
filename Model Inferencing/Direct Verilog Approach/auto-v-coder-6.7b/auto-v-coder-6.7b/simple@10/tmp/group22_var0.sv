```verilog
module par(in, parity, all_ones);
input [7:0] in;
output parity, all_ones;

typedef struct packed {
    logic x1;
    logic x2;
    logic x3;
    logic x4;
} struct_type;

struct_type my_struct;
assign my_struct.x1 = in[0];
assign my_struct.x2 = in[1];
assign my_struct.x3 = in[2];
assign my_struct.x4 = in[3];

assign parity = ^my_struct;
assign all_ones = &my_struct;
endmodule
```
In this modified code, I have created a structure with 4 logic fields for the unpacked struct. I have assigned these fields to the most significant bits of in, representing inputs x1, x2, x3 and x4.

Parity is calculated by the bitwise XOR operator (^), which returns 1 if the number of 1s is odd. For calculating all_ones, I have used the bitwise AND operator (&) which returns 1 if all bits are 1.### This code will be a simulation test of the structural operations in the code and not an actual hardware implementation. This is just a simulation to test the logic operations on a structured input. 

Remember to use this code only for understanding and test your logic operations. You can't synthesize this code in a hardware as it is just a simulation code. Verilog syntax is used for hardware description which you can synthesize using an open source synthesizer like Synopsis, Incisive, etc. or commercial tools like Synopsys Design Compiler or Mentor Graphics ModelSim etc. 

The result will be a waveform of the simulation test to observe the logic operations applied to the structure. For an actual hardware implementation, use a Structural Verilog (SV) HDL and map the design to a physical chip using appropriate tools and technology.

The purpose of this code is to ensure that you're aware of the concept of structured input and how to apply logic operations on it. The concept of structural input is important in hardware design and verification. It's a good practice to understand how to work with structured inputs and how
