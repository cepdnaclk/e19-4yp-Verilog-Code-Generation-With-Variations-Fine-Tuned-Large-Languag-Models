```SV
module ALU (output logic signed [31:0] Result, input logic signed [31:0] ArgA, ArgB, input logic Clk);

always_ff @(posedge Clk) begin
    Result <= ArgA + ArgB;
end

endmodule
```

In this modified code, the inputs a and b are signed 32-bit integers, and the result is also a signed 32-bit integer. The clock is used to trigger the operation of the ALU. The operation in this code is simply the addition of a and b. The code uses 'always_ff' to make this a flip-flop that acts synchronously to the posedge of the Clk. The'specify' and 'endspecify' tags are removed to ensure that Verilog syntax is not violated.

Please note that the'specparam' statement was deprecated in 2005 and was removed in 2009 in the Verilog standard. Hence, the'specify' statement is not valid in the current Verilog standard.

The'specparam tRise = 5, tFall = 4' is also removed as it also was deprecated in the Verilog standard.'specify' was used in combination with 'endspecify' to specify rise and fall times, but those were not explicitly utilized in this provided code and thus, their removal is appropriate.

The'specify' syntax was used for specifying timing constraints which are used in synthesis tools (like Synopsys Design Compiler) to improve the timing of digital circuits. However, the functionality of the circuit (arithmetic addition in this case) does not change and thus, the timing constraints are not necessary here. Thus the entire'specify' block is removed.```SV

always_ff @(posedge Clk) begin
    Result <= ArgA + ArgB;

This code will perform addition of two 32-bit signed integers based on the clock and the inputs a and b. The result will be stored in the Result output. The clock is used to
