```verilog
module tst_dff_pbeh();
  logic di,clk; 
  logic do;
  dff_p d1(do,di,clk); // Instantiate DFF with path delay
  initial begin clk=0; di=1'b0; #35 $stop; end // Initialize & stop
  always #3 clk=~clk; // Generate clock (negedges at 6, 12, 18...)
  always #5 di=~di; // Toggle data
  initial $monitor($time,"clk=%b, di=%b, do=%b",clk,di,do);
endmodule
```
This code will continue to operate as intended, but for consistency and future-proofing, the use of logic data types is recommended. For example, using logic instead of reg simplifies the logic of the design and makes it easier to read and understand. Itâ€™s also a good practice to use logic for all internal signals, as it allows the designer to easily switch between Verilog and SystemVerilog designs. This will also allow the designer to easily add SystemVerilog features down the line if needed.###

Note: This code will only work with a design that uses SystemVerilog, or Verilog-2001 or later, as the `logic` data type was introduced in Verilog-2001. Verilog-2001 or later is the standard for SystemVerilog, a superset of Verilog. If you are coding in Verilog-2001 or later, using logic for all signals can greatly simplify the design and make it easier to understand. However, if you are coding in a toolset that does not support Verilog-2001 or later (like Modelsim), you will have to use reg for all signals.###

If you are using Verilog-95 (the ancestor of Verilog), you cannot use logic. This is because logic was introduced in Verilog-2001. 

Keep it in mind that the usage of reg and logic is purely a matter of coding style, and doesn't have any functional effect on the overall functionality of the design. For maximum compatibility with the tools and standard
