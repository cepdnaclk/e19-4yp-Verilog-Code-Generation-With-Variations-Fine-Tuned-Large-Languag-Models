```verilog
// Verilog code for Problem 5, variation for logic [7:0]
module Half_Adder(
    input [7:0] A, B,
    output logic [7:0] Sum, Carry
);
    assign Sum = A ^ B;
    assign Carry = A & B;
endmodule
```

This code will work the same way as the previous code, but the output will be defined as a 8-bit bus that can hold values from 0 to 255. This modification is useful when you want to represent the signal as a digital number from 0 to 255.
Note: Use the appropriate bus width for the application. In the new version, the bus width is set to 8 bits for A and B inputs and Sum, Carry outputs, which are 8-bit wide. If you need to use the signal in a smaller or larger width, you can change the bus width accordingly.
