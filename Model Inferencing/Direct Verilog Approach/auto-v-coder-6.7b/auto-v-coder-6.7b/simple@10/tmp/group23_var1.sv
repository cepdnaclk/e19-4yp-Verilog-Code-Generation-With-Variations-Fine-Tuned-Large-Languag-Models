```verilog
module FourFlopsStructL #(parameter DClk = 2, DBuf = 1)
(output logic[3:0] Q, input logic[3:0] D, input logic Ena, input logic Clk);
wire logic[3:0] QWire;
localparam DTot = DBuf + DClk;
DFF DReg[3:0] (.Q(QWire),.D(D),.Clk(Clk));
assign #DTot Q = (Ena==1'b1)? QWire : 'bz;
endmodule
```
This code will change the base type of the input vectors to byte and output vector to logic. This test will help to ascertain whether the verilog simulator supports byte-type inputs and logic-type outputs. If the simulator does not support these types, the appropriate modifications will be required.

Note: Be aware of the subtlety involved with these changes. Byte is a higher level abstraction than logic, so this may not translate directly to logic, and may require some additional circuitry. Be aware of this when using byte types in your design. ### 2. Change the base type of the output vector from logic to reg:

```verilog
module FourFlopsStructL #(parameter DClk = 2, DBuf = 1)
(output reg[3:0] Q, input logic[3:0] D, input logic Ena, input logic Clk);
wire reg[3:0] QWire;
localparam DTot = DBuf + DClk;
DFF DReg[3:0] (.Q(QWire),.D(D),.Clk(Clk));
assign #DTot Q = (Ena==1'b1)? QWire : 'bz;
endmodule
```

This code will change the base type of the output vector to reg, which is a lower level abstraction than logic. This test will help to ascertain whether the verilog simulator supports reg-type outputs. If the simulator does not support reg type outputs, the appropriate modifications will be required.

Note: Be aware that reg should be used with care, as it is intended to represent combinational logic. If you do not explicitly model your design as combinational
