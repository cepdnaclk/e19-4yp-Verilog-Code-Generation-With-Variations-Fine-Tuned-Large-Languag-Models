```verilog
module mos_strength (a, c, zn, zp);
input a, c;
output zn, zp;
nmos (zn, a, c);
pmos (zp, a, c); 
enum logic [1:0] {PASS, NOT_PASS} result;
always @(*) begin
    if (a &!c) begin
        result = PASS; // If 'a' is 1 and 'c' is 0, set result to PASS
    end else if (!a & c) begin
        result = NOT_PASS; // If 'a' is 0 and 'c' is 1, set result to NOT_PASS
    end else begin
        result = {PASS, NOT_PASS}[0]; // Default value, should not get to here
    end
end
endmodule
```
In the code above, we have replaced xor and and gate expressions with a logic-vector based enum to test enum operations. The enum logic [1:0] {PASS, NOT_PASS} now defines two states, i.e., PASS and NOT_PASS with the enum values 0 and 1 respectively. The always @(*) block is used to create a combinational logic block that evaluates the inputs a and c and sets the result based on the conditions. Please note that this is a simple example and does not cover all the requirements of an enum-assigned signal. Also, enum variables should be in sensitivity lists.
  
You should replace the result assignment logic to suit your needs. The enum is used here to test its enum operations, but in a real design, the result assignment logic would also depend on device-specific conditions and could further be optimized. 

Also, ensure to make sure the design can be synthesized properly and to ensure all the required ports and signals are defined correctly and connected as per the design requirements. 

Finally, keep in mind the enum type is dependent on Verilog's integer range, thus you wouldn't be able to declare an enum type with {PASS, NOT_PASS, DEFAULT} with an integer range of [1:3]. Similarly, you could not declare an enum type with a string type, etc.appropriately for your application. Verilog defines various data types, but they need to be used correctly according to the context
