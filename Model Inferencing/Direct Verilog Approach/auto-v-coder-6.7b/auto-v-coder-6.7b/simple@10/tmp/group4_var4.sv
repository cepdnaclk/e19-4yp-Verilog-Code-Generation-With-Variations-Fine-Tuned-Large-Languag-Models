```verilog
module testbench ();

// Define a structure with a rand member
struct {
    rand bit [7:0] addr;
} struct_data;

// Test randomization
initial begin
    // Applying randomization
    void'(struct_data.randomize());
    // Printing the value of addr after randomization
    $display("Randomized addr: %h", struct_data.addr);
end

endmodule
```
In the modified code, `addr` is an 8-bit data member of the structure, and `randomize()` applies random values to each of its elements. This will make the testbench module produce different output each time it is tested. The `void'(struct_data.randomize())` line is to ignore any errors when randomizing. If the randomization fails, the simulation may end with an error. This line is only to demonstrate how to apply randomization and may not be necessary in a typical use case.

Remember to put this into a separate file and then compile it with a Verilog simulator like ModelSim or Icarus Verilog. The console output will show the value of `addr` after randomization. Each time you run the testbench, it will produce different output due to the random values applied in the randomization.

Remember that Verilog does not support randomization of structs. In actual Verilog, you can only randomize the elements of a struct, not the struct itself. This is why a struct is needed in this case to achieve randomization of individual bits within an array.

Note: The modified code may not compile if `randomize` function is not supported by your simulator. In that case, you would need to use a different approach or use Verilog.

Also note that randomization is by default disabled in Icarus Verilog, which is usually used to compile Verilog code. If you want to run randomization, you will need to compile with a different simulator or remove the randomization call. 

This code is a basic setup and should fit into a typical Verilog design. However, the randomization approach should be adapted to suit the specific testbench or module requirements.```verilog
