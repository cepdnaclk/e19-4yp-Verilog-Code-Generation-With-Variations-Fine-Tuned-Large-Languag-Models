```verilog
module orfr_tst; // Testbench for OR gate with force/release
  reg b,c; wire a;
  initial begin b=1'b0; c=1'b0; #20 $stop; end // Initialize inputs
  always #3 c = ~c; // Toggle input 'c' every 3 time units
  or_fr_rl dd(a,b,c); // Instantiate the module containing force/release
endmodule
```
This code demonstrates a basic testbench for a design whose input values are continuously changing. It does not include the force/release instructions, which are specific to the SystemVerilog language, and are not compatible with Verilog. 

If you wish to use force/release instructions, you would need to change the design from Verilog to SystemVerilog. Keep in mind, force/release are only used for initial simulation setups, and they don't work in simulation environments like modelsim, gtkwave, etc. They are intended for debugging, and the use of force/release is not common in typical Verilog design flows.

If you are looking for a modified design that includes force/release, you will need to use a language that supports them, such as SystemVerilog. In SystemVerilog, you can use the force and release tasks to set the value of a signal at a specific time, and clear the value after a certain time.

For example:

```verilog
initial begin
  // Force value of b to be 1 during the first 100 time units
  force b = 1'b1;
  #100;
  // Release value of b back to 0 as it is no longer needed
  release b;

  // Force value of c to be 1 during the first 50 time units
  force c = 1'b1;
  #50;
  // Release value of c back to 0 as it is no longer needed
  release c;

  // After both forces and releases, stop simulation
  #20;
  $stop;
end
```

Remember, force/release is a tool for debugging, not for running a full simulation. For simulations, you usually would just assign values to the
