```verilog
module AndOr (output bit X, Y, input bit A, B, C);
assign #10 X = A & B;
assign #10 Y = B | C;
endmodule
```
In this modified code, the type of inputs and outputs have been changed from wire to bit. This is a common practice for SystemVerilog coding. 

The `bit` type in SystemVerilog is a built-in variable type that can hold a single bit of data (0 or 1). This is unlike the original `wire` type, which can hold a single bit of data or an array of bits. Note that bit type in verilog is similar to a bit in C programming language. It's not the same as boolean in C.

The `assign` statement has also been modified to include a delay of 10 time units, which is similar to a `#10` delay in Verilog. 

Now the module can be instantiated and tested in a SystemVerilog environment.```verilog
module tb();
bit A, B, C;
bit X, Y;

AndOr DUT(X, Y, A, B, C);

initial begin
    #10 A = 1'b1; B = 1'b0; C = 1'b0;
    #10 A = 1'b0; B = 1'b0; C = 1'b1;
    #10 A = 1'b1; B = 1'b1; C = 1'b1;
end

initial begin
    $monitor("A = %b, B = %b, C = %b, X = %b, Y = %b at time = %t", A, B, C, X, Y, $time);
end

endmodule
```
This testbench instantiates the `AndOr` module and applies different input combinations. The `$monitor` statement is used to print the current values of the inputs and outputs every time the `$display` statement is executed. This allows the simulation of the `AndOr` module to be verified.
