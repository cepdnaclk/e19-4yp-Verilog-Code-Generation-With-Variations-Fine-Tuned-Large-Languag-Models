```verilog
module t_Clock_Prog ();
wire clock;

initial #100 $finish;
Clock_Prog M1 (clk);
endmodule

module Clock_Prog (clk);
input clk;

enum {ON, OFF} State_enum;

initial begin
State_enum = ON;
#10;
State_enum = OFF;
end

always @ (posedge clk) begin
case(State_enum)
ON: $display("State is ON");
OFF: $display("State is OFF");
default: $display("State is undefined");
endcase
end
endmodule
```
This variation introduces an enum state_enum with two values: ON and OFF. The state starts with ON, then transitions to OFF after 10 time units. 

The resetn input is replaced with the state_enum enum and a SystemVerilog case statement is used to test the different cases of the enum. The case statement is checked for every positive edge on the clock input. Therefore, if you provide a clock input that's driven high and low at specific times, you can see the different outputs for different states of the enum. This example can help to cover enum statement coverage in a Verilog code.

Also, you can add more states to the enum, modify the state transitions, and test the different cases of the enum to increase the coverage.
Note: This code should be synthesizable and runnable in an appropriate SystemVerilog environment such as Icarus Verilog or VCS. It is provided as a conceptual demonstration and may not run as expected in a real synthesis environment. The modifications made here aim to provide a simple, executable code snippet for testing enum coverage in a Verilog code. Please adapt as necessary for your specific use case.###```verilog
