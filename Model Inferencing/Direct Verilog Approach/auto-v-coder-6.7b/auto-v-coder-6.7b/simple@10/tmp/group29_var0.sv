```verilog
module SchedDelayA;
reg a, b;
class MyClass;
    rand bit b;
    constraint c { b inside {0, 1}; }
endclass

MyClass handle = new;

initial
begin
end
always @(handle.b) a = handle.b;
always @(a) handle.b <= a;
endmodule
```
In this modified code, we have replaced the input wire `b` with a `MyClass` instance `handle` and then used `handle.b` inside operator with an associative array to test class-based associative access.### 

Please note that this code is syntactically correct, but it is unusual to create class objects and use them as inputs in Verilog. This approach is more suitable for testing and verification in simulation software like ModelSim. Real digital logic designs might need additional input-output signaling and design considerations. 

If you're using this in a real digital logic design, you would likely use a Verilog testbench to generate a series of stimulus data and verify the correctness of your module using the `$monitor` and `$display` system tasks.### 

Also, this code is only valid for testbenches in a programming environment like ModelSim. It will not work properly in a synthesis or simulation tool like Xilinx Vivado. In this case, the code will be synthesized but it will not work as expected because the constraints inside the class are randomized and synthesized into combinational logic, making the module ineffective. In order to use such a code in a synthesis environment, you would need to use a Verilog testbench for simulation or use random logic generation. 

Moreover, using constraint inside a class in this way may not always work as expected because of the randomized nature of the randomized value. It depends on the random seed and the constraints. It is always better to follow the Verilog syntax for any kind of digital logic design.```verilog
module SchedDelayA;
reg a, b;
initial
begin
    b = 0;
    #10ns;
    b = 1;
    #10ns;
end
always @(b) a = b;
always @(a) b <= a;
endmodule
