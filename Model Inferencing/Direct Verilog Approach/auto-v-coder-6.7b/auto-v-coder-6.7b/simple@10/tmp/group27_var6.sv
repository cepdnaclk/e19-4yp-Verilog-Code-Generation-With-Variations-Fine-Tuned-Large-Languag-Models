### Instructions for Running the Code:
Run the modified code as a testbench to see the simulation results. You need to have a Verilog simulator like GTKWave or ModelSim.
Please note that this code only checks the functionality of the HA. For correct functionality, the entire system should be tested. 

### Testbench Verilog Code:

```verilog
module testbench();

  reg a,b;
  wire s,ca;
  
  // Instantiate HA
  ha_9 hh(s,ca,a,b);

  // Testing Process
  initial begin
    $dumpfile("dump.vcd"); 
    $dumpvars(0, testbench); 
    a=0; b=0; #5;
    a=1; b=0; #5;
    a=0; b=1; #5;
    a=1; b=1; #5;
    $finish;
  end

  // Monitoring Process
  initial begin
    $monitor($time, " a = %b, b = %b,out carry = %b, outsum = %b ",a,b,ca,s);
  end

endmodule
```

In this module, we are trying to check if the sum (s) and carry (ca) outputs are correct. The “assign” in the ha_9 module is used to assign the outputs.
When the testbench runs, it will initialize the a and b values, wait for 5ns, change the value of a and b, wait for 5ns, and so on
