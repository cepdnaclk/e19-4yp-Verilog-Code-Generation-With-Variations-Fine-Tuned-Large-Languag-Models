```verilog
typedef struct packed {
  logic x;
  logic y;
  logic z;
} signal_struct;

module Problem8(input signal_struct a, b, output signal_struct diff);
  assign diff = (signal_struct'({a.x - b.x, a.y - b.y, a.z - b.z}));
endmodule
```
In this modified code, we define a packed structure `signal_struct` with three bits `x`, `y`, and `z`. We then declare our two input signals a and b as type `signal_struct`. The `diff` output is also of type `signal_struct`, and we assign it the result of the subtraction of the corresponding bits of `a` and `b`. This illustrates how signals within a packed structure can be manipulated and assigned to other signals of the same structure.

Note: Be sure to test this new code with a design tool or simulator as it may need specific signal and test bench environment. It's also worth mentioning that packed structures must be synthesizable. Some tools may not support the use of packed structures for synthesis.
