```
module ha_2(s,ca,a,b,delayParam); // Half Adder with gate delays
  input a,b; output s,ca;
  // Define a structure type for parameters
  typedef struct packed {
    int s, ca;
  } delayParams;
  // Use this parameter input to define delays
  input delayParams delayParam;
  xor #(delayParam.s,delayParam.s/2) (s,a,b);
  and #(delayParam.ca,delayParam.ca/2) (ca,a,b);
endmodule
```
Note: Please be careful when using non-zero delays because it can introduce timing issues in the design. Delays are typically used for testing or for simulating real hardware behavior with delays in the gates. If you want to use this in a synthesizable model, you might want to consider using a Verilog preprocessor to assign different sets of delays to parameters.
This code will still be synthesizable but won't necessarily produce the same behavior in hardware as the original code due to the limitations in using unpacked structures with delays. It's more about a more flexible way to handle delays in a way that they can be altered at runtime or during simulation.

For a real synthesizable model, you probably need to use Verilog preprocessing to assign different delays to different modules or instances.

Also, the delay parameters should be assigned accordingly when using different delay values, for example:

```
assign delayParam.s = 1;
assign delayParam.ca = 2;
```
This way you can alter the delay values during the runtime or simulation. This is just an example, the actual assignment should be done based on the hardware delays in the design.
Finally, keep in mind that parameter values like delays, should be calculated considering the specific hardware delays in the design, the actual delays can vary greatly depending on the specific hardware used.### TL;DR
This modification allows for delays to be driven by values stored in an unpacked structure with signed members, but it's important to note that synthesizable Verilog designs should use fixed delays for gates as there are significant implications in timing issues and timing closure. The delay parameters should be assigned according to the specific hardware delays in the design to fully leverage the structure and functionality provided by unpacked structures.
