```verilog
module gade(a,a1,b,c,b1,c1);
input b,c,b1,c1;
output a,a1, packed_struct;

// Define a packed structure type
typedef packed struct packed {
    logic a;
} packed_struct_t;

// Instantiate the OR gate with an inertial delay of 3
or #3 gg1(a1, c1, b1);

// Instantiate the AND gate with a rise time of 2 and a fall time of 1, and an inertial delay
and #(2,1) gg2(a, b, c);

// Pack the values into the packed structure type
packed_struct_t packed_struct = '{a: a};
endmodule
```
In this modified code, we added a typedef to define a packed structure type. We then instantiated the OR and AND gates as before, and also included a declaration for the packed_struct output which is an instance of this packed structure type. The logic value from the output of the AND gate is packed into the packed_struct output.

Note: In synthesizing this code, the packed_struct output will be synthesized as a packed structure. This is because Verilog does not currently support nested structures as wire outputs. If the synthesis tool supports structured data output, it is recommended that instead of using a packed structure, you use unpacked arrays or unpacked structs to represent more complex data types.

Remember that packed_struct is a packed structure type, it can only be synthesized as a structure, and it cannot be assigned to a real wire. Hence, in this particular example, we are just using it for demonstration. Please adjust this code as per the actual requirements in your application.

Also, it's worth mentioning that, there's no standard way to create nested structures in Verilog, you'll have to define them as flat structures. This is a limitation of Verilog syntax, and there can be workarounds but they are often complex and require manual setup/teardown.

This model aims to illustrate the use of unpacked structure handling for complex data types in Verilog. #(2,1) in the delay of the AND gate is to show the rise and fall
