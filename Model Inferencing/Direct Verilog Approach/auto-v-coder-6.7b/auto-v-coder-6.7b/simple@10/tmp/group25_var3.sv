```Verilog
module mos_strength (a, c, zn, zp);
input a, c;
output zn, zp;

enum logic [1:0] {NMOS, PMOS} 

nmos (zn, a, c); // NMOS passes 'a' when 'c' is 1 (outputs NMOS or Z)
pmos (zp, a, c); // PMOS passes 'a' when 'c' is 0 (outputs PMOS or Z)

endmodule
```
In this modified code, the nmos and pmos outputs are connected with the zn and zp outputs respectively. The output from each is the enum NMOS or PMOS depending on inputs 'a' and 'c'. When 'a' is 1 and 'c' is 1, the output will be the enum NMOS, and when 'a' is 1 and 'c' is 0, the output will be the enum PMOS. This enum allows us to test the functionality of verilog on enum operations.

Please note that, the real implementation of the nmos and pmos models in this code should depend on the technology being used. The nmos and pmos here are placeholders for the actual transistors modeled in Verilog. The real model of NMOS and PMOS in verilog is a bit more complex and may involve modeling of the propagation delay, drain and source resistance, and various other parameters.

Also, note that in the modified code, if 'a' is 0 or 1, the output will be Z (high impedance) because the transistors modeled for nmos and pmos are not designed to output a stable logic level. These transistors are intended to be switched on and off by the control signals 'c'. In this case, the control signals 'c' should be a strong input signal which is used to switch on the transistors and the 'a' input is usually connected to the driving source which is the logic level output of the gate. This is a high-level perspective of the transistors modeled to drive 'a'.

This code is written for educational or simulation purpose but not for real world application. This code will not drive an actual NMOS or PMOS transistor. In the real world application, you will need to use the appropriate transistor model, which
