```verilog
module ALU (output logic[31:0] Result, input logic[31:0] ArgA, ArgB, input Clk);
    logic signed [3:0] a, b;

    always @ (posedge Clk) begin
        a <= ArgA;
        b <= ArgB;
    end

    specify
        // assign Result = a + b;
        for (Result = a + b[3:0]; a + b[3:0] === Result;);

        specparam tRise = 5, tFall = 4;
        (Clk *> Result) = (tRise, tFall);
    endspecify
endmodule
```
### Test Bench:
```verilog
module ALU_tb;
    logic [31:0] ArgA, ArgB, Result;
    logic Clk;

    ALU uut (Result, ArgA, ArgB, Clk);

    initial begin
        // Initialize inputs
        ArgA = 32'd5;
        ArgB = 32'd7;

        // Apply inputs
        Clk = 1'b0;
        #10;
        Clk = 1'b1;
        #10;
        Clk = 1'b0;

        // Output result
        $display("Result = %d", Result);
    end
endmodule
```
This test bench creates an instance of the ALU module and applies the inputs ArgA and ArgB. The `#10` delay is necessary to accommodate the propagation delay of the input to the ALU.
The `$display` line is used to print the value of the Output Result to the console.

Remember to include the `.v` file in the `TB` when running the test bench simulation.
The simulator will then show the result of the ALU's operation.

Note: Specify requires modelsim compilation. The above code is for simulation. In synthesis, these features will be ignored.

Note: This code is not synthesizable. Synthesis tools like design compilers, such as Yosys, will not translate this code into the equivalent Verilog code, as the specify statement is not supported
