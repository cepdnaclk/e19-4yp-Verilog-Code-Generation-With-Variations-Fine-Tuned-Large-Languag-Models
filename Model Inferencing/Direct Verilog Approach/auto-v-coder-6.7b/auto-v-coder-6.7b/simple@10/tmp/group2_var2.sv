```verilog
module test;
wire a;
reg x, y, z;

typedef struct packed {
    reg x;
    reg y;
    reg z;
} packed_reg_t;

packed_reg_t packed_reg;

assign #25 a = 1;
always begin
    packed_reg.x = #10 a;
end
endmodule
```

This code will declare a packed structure called `packed_reg_t` that includes the signals `x`, `y`, and `z`. Now, when you modify `packed_reg.x`, the change will be reflected in `x` due to the packed structure. This variation aims to test the handling of packed structures in Verilog. Note that packed structures are typically used in Verilog to reduce the data width of a signal, but they can also be used to represent complex signals or hierarchical systems.###  Note:
The original problem statement has different requirements and the solution is adapted accordingly. For original problem, we had to connect the `a` to `x` and `y` by assigning `x` and `y` different delayed assignments of `a`. This solution focuses on demonstrating the structure handling using packed structures. If the original problem requires different behavior, this solution may not work as intended.

Also note that Verilog does not support the assigning of structures to signals. Therefore, the packed_reg_t is assigned to `x`, `y`, and `z`. This is done to demonstrate how packed structures can be used. In reality, packed structures would be used to reduce the bit width of a signal to fit into the constraints of a system, rather than directly assigning the structure to another signal. 

The time delay of "#10 a" is added to demonstrate the delayed assignment. This delay is not part of the problem statement but is a standard practice in Verilog to distinguish between the signal's value at the current time and its value at the next clock edge. 

If you need to test the packed structure handling, this code shows the usage of `packed_reg_t` structure. However, the actual problem's requirements might be different and the solution should be adjusted accordingly. 

The original problem statement should be clearly defined for a more accurate solution.
