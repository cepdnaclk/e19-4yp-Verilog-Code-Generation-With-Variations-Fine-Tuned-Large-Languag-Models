```verilog
module testbench ();
// Define a structure with a randomized member
typedef struct {
  rand bit [31:0] addr;
} Memory;

// Create an instance of the structure
Memory memory;

// Randomize the structure
initial begin
  memory = new;
  if (!memory.randomize())
    $error("Randomization failed!");
  else
    $display("Randomized address: %x", memory.addr);
end
endmodule
```
This code creates a module named `testbench`. Inside this module, a struct named `Memory` is defined with a rand member `addr`. Then, an instance of this struct named `memory` is created. Inside the `initial` block, the `randomize` method is called on `memory` to randomize its `addr` member. If the randomization fails, an error message is displayed. Otherwise, the randomized address is displayed. This is a basic demonstration of randomization in Verilog. Note that for complex structures, more methods might be needed to randomize properly.

This code should be synthesized into a testbench and tested using a waveform viewer, like wavevision, to see the randomized address.

Remember, the randomization is not done just by `memory.randomize()`, but by calling `memory.randomize()` from the `initial` block of a procedural block. This ensures the randomization takes place at the start of the simulation. If the randomization is done inside a `generate` or `always` block, randomization might not occur. 

Also, always remember to use randomization constraints in the `rand` declarations of your struct members, as `randomize()` will not randomize an unconstrained variable. This is important for simulations that are more likely to verify property, as they might generate values that don't adhere to the constraints.

If you want to apply random constraint on the randomization, you can use a `with {}` clause after `randomize()` to specify the constraints. For example:
```verilog
if (!memory.randomize() with {addr >= 32'h1000; addr <= 32'h2000;})
```
This will ensure the `addr` member of `memory` is always
