```Verilog
module ModuleName ( input logic [1:0] A [0:3], 
	input logic B [0:3],
	input [7:0] data_in, 
	input load, 
	input clk,
	output logic [7:0] data_out [0:3] );

// Simple register (Instruction Register) loaded on posedge clk when load is high
always @( posedge clk )
if ( load ) begin
	for ( int i = 0 ; i < 4 ; i++ ) begin
	    data_out[i] <= A[i] + B[i];
	end
end
endmodule
```
The new module takes in two 4-element arrays of 2-bit wide elements, data_in, B, and data_out. It does the sum of A[i] and B[i] at the rising edge of the clock signal when load is high. 

Please note that if A or B are 1D arrays, the above code will still give an error. To solve this, the data type of A and B should be declared as packed 1D arrays or 2D arrays. Also, the data type of data_out should be logic as output. In the above logic, A and B are 2D arrays and data_out is 2D array.

Remember to replace `ModuleName` with the actual name of your module.###

This code is a simple demonstration of handling multiple dimensional arrays in Verilog. It's an example of how to process two 4-element arrays of 2-bit elements and generate another 4-element array using the sum of the inputs. It also demonstrates a simple register (Instruction Register) loaded on positive clock edge when the load signal is high.```Verilog
