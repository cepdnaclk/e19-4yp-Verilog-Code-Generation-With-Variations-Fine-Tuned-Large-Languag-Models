In the new module, the output f is now a signed logic vector of width 3, which means it can represent values from -4 to 7. So, it is suitable for signed logic operations. In the initial module, the output f was a single logic value, which was unsuitable for signed logic operations. This code will produce the same output as the initial one, but now it is signed logic.
Please note that you'll need to account for the fact that logic values are binary (0 or 1) while signed logic represents values from -1 to 1 in magnitude, and that the total range in magnitude is only from -4 to 7 in this case. Hence, this code is a variation of the initial code to make it signed.

The logic values are represented in binary form. 
For example, in a 3-bit signed logic vector, the range of possible values is from -4 to 7 instead of 0 to 7 before.
The 1st bit is the sign bit (-1,0,1), and the others are magnitude.
Remember to adjust your test cases accordingly to this new change.

Also, please note that without a testbench, there's no way to be sure of the outputs. I suggest adding one to verify the functionality of the module.

For more details, refer to the IEEE Std 1364-2005 (IEEE Std 1800-2005, IEEE Std 1364-2001) for the logic types and their ranges, which include signed logic vectors. In the latest versions of Verilog, logic types can be specified in the sensitivity list of a module instantiation, which can provide more flexibility and control over the types of variables to be used. However, keep in mind that using signed logic vectors might require different methods for simulation and synthesis.

In the case of this function, it's
