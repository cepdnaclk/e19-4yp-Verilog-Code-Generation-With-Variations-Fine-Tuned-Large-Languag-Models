```verilog
module sw2led2_testbench();

  reg [7:0] sw;
  wire [7:0] ld;

  sw2led2 dut(sw, ld);

  initial begin
    // Test Case 1: Unsigned values
    sw = 8'h55;
    #10;
    if (ld!== sw) $display("Test Case 1 Failed (Unsigned)");
    else $display("Test Case 1 Passed (Unsigned)");

    // Test Case 2: Signed values
    sw = 8'd-55;
    #10;
    if (ld!== sw) $display("Test Case 2 Failed (Signed)");
    else $display("Test Case 2 Passed (Signed)");

In the modified code, the module `sw2led2_testbench` is defined to verify the `sw2led2` module. The `sw2led2` module is instantiated and connected with the corresponding port wires. The internal memory signals are assigned to the simulation inputs.

Two test cases are included in this code:

1. Test Case 1: Unsigned values, where the 8-bit input is set to an unsigned value and the output is compared with the expected result.
2. Test Case 2: Signed values, where the 8-bit input is set to a signed value and the output is compared with the expected result.

The `$display` statements are used to print messages if the test cases fail or pass. This approach allows for easy test case verification.

Please note that for `$display` to work, `$monitor` should be used in conjunction with `$display`. The signals under `$monitor` will be displayed in real-time. To use the `$monitor` directive, you need to use `$dumpvars` to enable the automatic dump of signals. 

The `#10;` is used just to allow time for the assignments to propagate into the `ld`. Please adjust the delay time depending on your simulator's speed.

Also, make sure to use `$finish` to end the simulation when the expected results are achieved. This
