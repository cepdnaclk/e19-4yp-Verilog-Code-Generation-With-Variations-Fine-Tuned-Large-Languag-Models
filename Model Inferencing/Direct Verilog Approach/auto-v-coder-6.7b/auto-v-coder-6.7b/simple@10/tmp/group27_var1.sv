This design can be built into a DUT using a testbench to verify the operation.

```Verilog
module tstha_9();
  reg a,b; wire s,ca;
  ha_9 hh(s,ca,a,b); // Instantiate HA with rise/fall path delays
  initial begin a=0;b=0; end
  always #5 a=~a;
  always #10 b=~b;
  initial $monitor($time, " a = %b, b = %b,out carry = %b, outsum = %b ",a,b,ca,s);
  initial #30 $stop;
endmodule
```
In this modified code, the clk input to the DUT is now a modified version of `~a` and `~b` such that changes with different frequencies are applied to `a` and `b`. The `$monitor` statement now prints the current state of `a`, `b`, output `ca` and `s` of the design. The `#30 $stop;` statement stops the simulation after 30 time units. Note that actual delays may vary due to design factors such as gate delays, propagation delays, etc.

Please note that this code is a template for your design and would need to be modified to correctly reflect your design and test bench requirements. Also, be aware that this kind of design can produce unpredictable behavior due to the asynchronous changes in inputs.

To test the design, run the design and check the output waveforms in a simulator, or use a debugger to verify the output.

Before running this code, build your design and incorporate it into the design flow.

```Verilog
module ha_9(s,ca,a,b);
  input a,b;
  output s,ca;
  assign s = a^b;
  assign ca = a&b;
endmodule
```
This is the basic half-adder design. The `s` is the sum and `ca` is the carry out. 

Remember to add these files to your design flow or incorporate them directly in your current design flow to test the HA module.

Please replace `ha_9(s,ca,a,b);` to your
