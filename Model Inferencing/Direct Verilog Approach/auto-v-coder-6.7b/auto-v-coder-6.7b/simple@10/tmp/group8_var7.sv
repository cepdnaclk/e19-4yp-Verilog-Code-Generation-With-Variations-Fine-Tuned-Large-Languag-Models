```verilog
// Define a packed 1D logic-vector array
logic [1:0] A [0:3]; // Define an array of 4 elements with each element being a 2-bit packed vector

// Output register (Instruction Register) for the A array elements
always @( posedge clk )
if ( load ) begin
    // Use an inside operator to test multi-dimensional array handling
    for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) begin
        data_out[i] <= A[i][0] && A[i][1]; // Assuming the "and" operation for each 2-bit element in the array
    end
end
```
In this modified code, the `logic [1:0] A [0:3];` is declared as an array of 4 packed 2-bit logic-vector elements. The `always @( posedge clk ) if ( load ) begin... end` block of code is used to load the array elements on the positive edge of the clock when the `load` signal is high. 

Note that for multi-dimensional arrays, the `data_out[i] <= A[i][0] && A[i][1];` syntax is used. This denotes an "and" operation for each bit in each 2-bit element of the array. This is where the `data_out` is a packed 1D logic-vector array of 4 elements with each being a 2-bit packed vector. 

Remember that array indexing starts at 0 in Verilog. The "for" loop iterates over the entire array and performs the "and" operation for each 2-bit element in the array. The results are loaded back into the 2-bit packed vector `data_out`, which is then passed out of the module.

This version of the code tests the ability to handle multi-dimensional array operations in Verilog by using the "and" operation on each separate 2-bit element in the array. Please replace this with the actual computation logic according to your requirements.

Also, the initial values of `data_out` and `A` should be set at the start of your design or testbench. These values will be used to initialize the simulation model. The `load` signal is used to trigger the loading of
