```verilog
module wire_assign( output logic [3:0] out [10:1]);
    int i;
    initial begin
        for (i=1; i<=10; i++) begin
            out[i] = 4'b1111;
        end
    end
    always @(*) begin
        $display("out[1]: %b", out[1]);
        $display("out[2]: %b", out[2]);
        // assign out[2] to all ones
        out[2] = 4'b1111;
    end
endmodule
```
In this modified code, a wildcard-indexed associative array `out` is defined with the dimension 4 bits to 10 bits. The initial block is used to assign the values of `out` from 1 to 10 using a for loop. The always block is used to display the values of `out[1]` and `out[2]` at their respective times and also changes the value of `out[2]` to all ones.

This will display the values of `out[1]` and `out[2]` and also show the change in `out[2]` after assigning 1 to all four bits.

Please note that Verilog doesn't support wildcard indexed associative array, but the always block is used to simulate the change using a delay. The "always @(*)" block is used to read and write the values of the array. It's important to note that the values are not changed in the always block due to verilog's procedural nature. It is more for demonstration purposes. 

Also, beware of using the "initial" block in a design where concurrency is anticipated. "initial" blocks are executed at the start of the simulation, so if a concurrent change is made in the same block, "initial" block's change will not take effect. It's generally better to use "always" blocks in such cases. 

The code does not use the input `in` declared in the original code. If you have such an input, you need to pass the value to this module via the `input` port and add assignments accordingly.

The output signals are declared as `logic` instead of `wire
