The modified code will be as follows:

```verilog
module tstha_9();
  reg a,b;
  wire s,ca;
  ha_9 hh(s,ca,a,b); // Instantiate HA
  initial begin a=0;b=0; end
  always begin #5 a=1;b=0; #5 a=0;b=1; #5 a=1;b=1; #5 a=0;b=0; end
  initial $monitor($time, " a = %b, b = %b,out carry = %b, outsum = %b ",a,b,ca,s);
  initial #30 $stop;
endmodule
```

This is the basic code for the Verilog HA module. Here, we're creating a HA module named 'ha_9'. The module is taking in 2 input signals, 'a' and 'b', and giving out 2 output signals,'s' and 'ca'. This module follows the truth table for a HA.

In the following code, we're creating a tstha_9 module which tests our HA module. Using the $monitor function, we're monitoring the state of 'a', 'b', 'ca' and's' at each time step. The #5 at the end of each 'begin... #5' sequence is the delay between each test case. The simulation will last 30 time units (which is the delay after the last case).

Note that the change in the structure of the module (packed structure for clk) is not necessary for the operation of the HA module or the tstha_9 module as they are not connected to clk. They are just for struct signal routing. This is typically used in cases where clk is used in the design. 

Please let me know if you need help with anything else or if the code doesn't meet your specifications. Your feedback or suggestions are highly appreciated. Happy coding.

### Contents of ha_9:
```verilog
module ha_9(output reg s, ca, input a, b);
  always @(a or b) begin
    s=a^b;
    ca=a&b;
  end
