```verilog
// Verilog code for Problem 4
module XOR_Gate(
    input logic [1:0] A [0:3],
    output logic Y
);
    logic [1:0] B [0:3];
    assign Y = A[0] ^ B[0];
endmodule
```
The modified code first declares an array of 4 elements of a 2-bit width each (A). It also declares another array, B, with the same size and structure as A. Then, an inside operator is used to perform a XOR operation on the first element of A and B.

Note: This code assumes that the two arrays are of equal length and size (i.e., both A and B have 4 elements). The inside operator is used on array elements, which must be inside a module, an initial block, or a continuous assignment. Also, these changes are a simplification and would typically be used for verification purposes. In a real-world design, the values for A and B would typically come from a testbench or driven by external stimulus. In these cases, array assignment statements are not allowed directly inside a module.

In order to test this modified code, you would typically write a testbench that would assign values to both A and B, and then observe the output Y. This is beyond the scope of this problem. Note that this code is also very basic and doesn't account for potential corner cases or scenarios for the problem statement. 

In a real-world scenario, you would also likely need to use a higher-level construct such as a for loop, case statement, etc. to iterate over the arrays or to apply a XOR operation on all elements. These would typically be used in a real-world design.```verilog
// Verilog code for Problem 4
module XOR_Gate(
    input logic [1:0] A [0:3],
    output logic Y
);
    logic [1:0] B [0:3];
    always @(*) begin
        Y = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) begin
            Y = Y ^ A[i] ^ B[i];
        end
    end
