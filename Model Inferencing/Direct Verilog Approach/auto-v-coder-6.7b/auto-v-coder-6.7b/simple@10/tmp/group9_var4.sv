```verilog
module Problem8(input [3:0] a, b, output [3:0] diff);
  typedef struct packed {
    logic [3:0] x;
    logic [3:0] y;
    logic [3:0] z;
  } my_struct;

  my_struct xyz;

  initial begin
    xyz.x = a;
    xyz.y = b;
    xyz.z = xyz.x - xyz.y;
    diff = xyz.z;
  end

```
This modified code defines a packed structure called `my_struct` with three fields: `x`, `y`, and `z`. It then assigns the values of `a` and `b` to `x` and `y` respectively. After that, it subtracts `y` from `x` and assigns the result to `z` and finally outputs `z` as the difference. Note that the packed structure automatically expands the fields into the output ports. If you need to pack `z` into a single bit, use the appropriate assignment logic.

Also, note that the variables `a` and `b` are considered as constant signals to the hardware and can't be changed after the module instantiation. If you need these variables to be inputs that can change over time, you might need to use a register instead to store the values. In such case, `a` and `b` would have to be declared as `reg` instead of `input`. 

Please remember to replace `[3:0]` with `[n-1:0]` where n is the number of bits you want to use for your signals. This is a standard Verilog constraint where `n` is the number of bits to use for your signal. 

This design also assumes that a and b are unsigned values. For signed values, you'll need to use `signed` keyword in your packed structure declaration.

Also notice that this code performs operation on the entire struct instead of individual bits. This might not be what you want if you wanted to perform individual bitwise operations. In that case, you should consider using individual bits for each operation and then combining the results using the `bitwise and/or
