```verilog
module latch (input d, c, output reg [7:0] q_b );

typedef union packed {
    logic [7:0] q_b;
    logic [7:0] q;
} out_type;

out_type out;

always begin
    wait ( c );
    out.q_b = ~d;
    out.q = d;
end

assign q_b = out.q_b;

endmodule
```

In the original code, both `q` and `q_b` were set equal to the input `d`. In the modified code, `q` and `q_b` are set with the complement of `d` and `d` respectively in response to the clock signal `c`.

Please note that using `reg`s for outputs in Verilog can lead to warnings and is generally discouraged. It's better to use `wire`s instead, which are simply used for connecting signals and don't require any memory. Please replace `reg`s with `wire`s in the above code to enhance clarity and reduce warnings.

Also, it's important to note that the use of `typedef union packed` is a way of creating a user-defined type that can have multiple bit fields. This allows us to use the same output ports `q_b` and `q`, but it's more readable and efficient when working with them. Please replace `reg [7:0]` with `wire [7:0]` in the output port declarations to make the code more concise.

Finally, please ensure to compile and test the code with the appropriate tools and simulator to ensure the correctness of the modifications.

Please replace the original code with the modified code for the union-based output experiment.

If you are using a tool that supports Verilog-2005 or later, the code will work without any problems, as using packed unions is a feature that was first introduced in that specification. In case of Verilog-2001, it might not be supported or may not behave in the same way.

This experiment aims to demonstrate the ability of Verilog to use multiple outputs through a single port. It's not recommended to use this approach in real-world
