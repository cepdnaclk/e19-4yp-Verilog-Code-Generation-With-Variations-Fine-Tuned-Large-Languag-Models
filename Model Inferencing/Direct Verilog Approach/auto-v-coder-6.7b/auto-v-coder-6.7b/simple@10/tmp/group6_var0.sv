```verilog
module ALU ( input [7:0] a, b, input pass, add,
output logic[7:0] alu_out );
// Simple combinational ALU
always @(a or b or pass or add)
if (pass) alu_out = a;       // Pass input 'a'
else if (add) alu_out = a + b; // Add inputs 'a' and 'b'
else alu_out = 0;           // Default output is 0
endmodule
```
This code does exactly the same thing as the previous code, but with the output type changed to logic. This is a good practice to follow to ensure your design matches with the latest Verilog standards. This is especially pertinent in the present day, when IEEE 1364-2005 is the latest Verilog standard. 

Furthermore, logic is more appropriate for a signal carrying binary values (0/1) and reg is for storing some internal state or temporary values. This code changes the output declaration to use logic and is generally more appropriate for a combinational circuit. This is a fundamental difference in Verilog, which is an old language, but it's still widely used and some designs might not reflect the best practices. 

Note that adding a bit of extra functionality, such as subtraction or multiplication could be done by adding additional conditions to the if-else structure. This code already has a binary operator (addition) and it is used only once, so it doesn't take much space or increase the complexity. For a more complex use case, a separate module could be made for each operation (add, subtract, etc). In the future, using a finite state machine (FSM) and defining state transitions in a more straightforward way could be considered for a more complex design.

But for a simple combinational circuit like this, you don't need to do anything, because the change from reg to logic in Verilog 2005 does not impose any specific requirements, and older tools will still function correctly. Verilog 2005 is a quite new standard, and the differences are not usually noticeable until you start working with synthesizable code, which is the norm in today's hardware development. The code would still work without this change as long as you use Verilog-19
