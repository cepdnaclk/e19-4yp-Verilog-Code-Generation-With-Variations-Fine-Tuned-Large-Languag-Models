Here is a modified code which creates a struct with logic fields and apply operations on the structure:

```verilog
module par(in, parity, all_ones);
input [7:0] in;
output parity, all_ones;

// Struct for inputs
typedef struct packed {
    logic [7:0] x1;
    logic [7:0] x2;
    logic [7:0] x3;
    logic [7:0] x4;
} input_struct;

input_struct in_struct;

assign parity = ^in_struct;
assign all_ones = ~|in_struct;

// Assign the inputs to the struct fields
assign in_struct.x1 = in;
assign in_struct.x2 = in;
assign in_struct.x3 = in;
assign in_struct.x4 = in;

endmodule
```

This code creates a struct with logic fields x1, x2, x3, x4. It assigns the input `in` to these fields and then performs the bitwise operations `^` and `~|` on the struct. Note that `^` for x1 performs the bitwise XOR operation between all the bits and `~|` for x1 performs the bitwise NOR operation between all the bits of the input.
Please note that this code is a simple demonstration of how you could use structs and logic fields, it doesn't exactly replicate the functionality of the original code. Various optimizations and edge cases need to be handled according to your application.

Also, note that the unpacked struct does not support direct bitwise operations on the elements of the struct in Verilog. If you require more complex logic on the elements of the struct, you will need to perform operations on them individually and then sum/average/etc. them as needed.

Remember that unpacked structs are used for modeling large memories, complex data structures or when you want to be able to selectively write and read individual bits from the struct. If you are just trying to model inputs with different names, unpacked arrays or unpacked structs can be overkill and may not be necessary. For a simpler design, consider using individual inputs to directly perform the operations.

Also, the `^` and `~
