This code now uses a loop to test the D flip-flop with a dynamic array of test cases. The test cases are a sequence of binary values. The loop runs through each test case and sets the D flip-flop input with the proper value, while the flip-flop output value is monitored. The test bench also restarts the flip-flop after a number of cycles and checks that it is functioning properly. The test bench also waits for a specified amount of time before stopping to ensure that all cases are checked.### Testing Instruction:
To test this code, you need to compile the Verilog code and then run the simulation. There should be no errors when the code is compiled.
