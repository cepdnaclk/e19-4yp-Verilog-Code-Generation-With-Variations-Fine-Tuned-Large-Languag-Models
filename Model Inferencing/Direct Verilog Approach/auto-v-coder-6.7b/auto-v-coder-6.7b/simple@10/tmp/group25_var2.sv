// Define an enum for the two states

always @(*) begin

    if (c)
        state_vector = St0;
    else

    // Assign the output based on the current state
    case (state_vector)
        St0: begin

            zp = 1;
        end
        St1: begin
            zn = 1;
            zp = 0;
        end
        default: begin

In this modified code, an enum has been used to represent the two states (`St0` and `St1`). The `always @(*)` block is used to continuously update the output value based on the current state. The state is updated based on the value of the input `c`. The output of the module is updated based on the state using a case statement. If the state is `St0`, `zn` is set to 0 and `zp` is set to 1. If the state is `St1`, `zn` is set to 1 and `zp` is set to 0. Any other state such as `default`, `zn` and `zp` are set to 0. This variation test the enum operation in a more realistic context as per the requirements. 
Please make sure to add the correct module declaration and port mapping according to your Verilog testbench. 

This example code is a simple logic gate based on the state transition with a enum for the two states. The enum was used here to represent the logic gates in a more natural way. For a more complex logic design, you may want to use a different approach. This code may not represent the best practice for Verilog design and may not be optimal for any particular application. It is merely an example to illustrate the concept of testing enum operations in Ver
