```verilog
module orfr_tst; // Testbench for OR gate with force/release
    typedef struct packed { logic a; logic b; string c; } DataIn;
    typedef struct packed { logic y; string z; } DataOut;
   
  
    DataIn in;
    DataOut out;
    
    initial begin 
        in.a = 1'b0; 
        in.b = 1'b0; 
        in.c = "Initial";
        #20 $stop; 
    end // Initialize inputs
    
    always #3 in.b = ~in.b; // Toggle input 'b' every 3 time units
    
    always_ff @(posedge in.b) begin
        in.c = "Toggling";  // Changing the string value on posedge
    end
    
    or_fr_rl dd(out,in); // Instantiate the module containing force/release
endmodule
```
In this modified code, we have defined a struct DataIn which includes a logic type 'a', 'b', and a string type 'c'. Also, we have defined a struct DataOut which includes a logic type 'y' and a string type 'z'. The task here is to force/release the module where the DataIn and DataOut are used in it.

Please note that force/release is not supported in structural Verilog, as Verilog was originally an imperative language with a different syntax. So, it is not possible to use force/release in this context. However, in behavioral Verilog, force/release can be used. Please change the type definitions accordingly to your tool and target architecture for force/release to work.### Modified Code for Verilog Coding Style (Force/Release):

Please note that force/release is not supported in structural Verilog, as Verilog (and subsequently SystemVerilog) was originally an imperative language with a different syntax. So, it is not possible to use force/release in this context. However, in behavioral Verilog, force/release can be used.
