Here, the ALU testbench has been modified to include stimulus for 4-bit logic vectors a, b, and f. The testbench will now run these operations in a sequence, simulating the behavior of the ALU with different operations. The result is then printed along with the inputs and control signals.

This allows for more comprehensive testing of the ALU functionality in different cases. The ALU is also designed to be a generic 4-bit binary ALU, able to perform addition, subtraction, bitwise AND, and bitwise OR operations. This allows us to test all four operations at once, making it a more comprehensive test. ### Note:
Remember to replace "alu_1" with the actual name of your ALU module. For example, if your ALU module is named "ALU", you should replace "alu_1" with "ALU". ### Warning:
This testbench is a simplified representation of
