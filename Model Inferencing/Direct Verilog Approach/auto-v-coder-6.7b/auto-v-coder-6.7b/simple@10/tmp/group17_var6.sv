```verilog
module ALU (output logic[31:0] Result, input logic[31:0] ArgA, ArgB, input logic Clk);

always @(posedge Clk) begin
    if (ArgB[3] == 1'b1) begin // subtraction or logical shift right
        Result <= ArgA - ArgB;
    end else if (ArgB[3:0] == 4'b1111) begin // logical shift right
        Result <= ArgA >>> ArgB[2:0];
    end else begin // addition or logical and or logical or
        Result <= ArgA + ArgB;
    end
end

specify
    specparam tRise = 5, tFall = 4;
    (Clk *> Result) = (tRise, tFall);
endspecify

endmodule
```

In this modified code, I added the if, else if, and else statements to differentiate between the types of operations. The if statement checks if b's 4th bit is set, indicating a subtraction operation, otherwise, if the entire binary value of b is 0xF, it performs a logical shift right operation, and otherwise it performs an addition or logical and or logical or operation. The always block of the code is triggered each time the clock edge is detected. This ensures that the operations are carried out.

The specparam statement is there to specify timing constraints for the Result output.

The design ensures that the correct operation is performed based on the value of ArgB and ArgA. This version of the design is not meant for a real-time system but for the purpose of demonstration and understanding of how Verilog works under different conditions.

Note: Verilog has a different syntax compared to Python or C. This may require some understanding of the language specification and syntax.

Note: Logical shift right operator `>>>` is used because it fills with zeros from the left side, which is the expected behavior for ALU operations. It is not logical shift right operation, rather it is logical right shift operation.

Also, don't forget to check if your synthesis tool supports the specified timing constraints. Some synthesizers might not support specifying timing at a pin level as mentioned. 

Note: Always test you verilog code
