```
module example3(Data, Clock, Reset, RegSum, Sum);
input Clock, Reset;
input [3:0] Data;
output [3:0] Sum, RegSum;
wire [3:0] Sum, RegSum;
reg4 R1 (Sum, Clock, Reset, RegSum);
assign Sum = Data + RegSum;
endmodule
```
The test bench for this code should look as following:

```
module example3_tb;
reg Clock;
reg Reset;
reg [3:0] Data;
wire [3:0] Sum, RegSum;

example3 uut(
   .Clock(Clock),
   .Reset(Reset),
   .Data(Data),
   .Sum(Sum),
   .RegSum(RegSum)
);

initial begin
    $dumpfile("dump.vcd");
    $dumpvars;
end

always #5 Clock = ~Clock;

initial begin
    Clock = 1'b0;
    Reset = 1'b1;
    Data = 4'b0000;
    #10 Reset = 1'b0;
    #20 Data = 4'b0011;
    #100 $finish;
end
endmodule
```

We can simulate the design by running the above test bench. We have not included the reg4 module for brevity. However, the functionality of reg4 would be the same as the current module, and you can implement this appropriately.

Also, note the use of #20 in the initial block of the test bench to delay the input of the Data signal to prevent combinational loop. This is necessary because the RegSum is driven by an internal signal (Sum) within the reg4 module. Without this delay, the test bench will read the initial value of RegSum as 0 at time 0 during which the combinational loop would occur.

Please replace reg4 with the appropriate implementation of a 4-bit register/accumulator.

The final result of the test bench will be a digital waveform trace (.vcd) file which can be analyzed using a tool such as ModelSim.

The code for the reg4 module will look something similar to the
