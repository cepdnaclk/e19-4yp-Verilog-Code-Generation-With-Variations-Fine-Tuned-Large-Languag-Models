```verilog
module FourFlopsStructL #(parameter DClk = 2, DBuf = 1)
(output[3:0] Q, input[3:0] D, input byte Ena, Clk);
wire[3:0] QWire;
localparam DTot = DBuf + DClk;
DFF DReg[3:0] (.Q(QWire),.D(D),.Clk(Clk));
assign #DTot Q = (Ena==1'b1)? QWire : 'bz;
endmodule
```
This code will ensure compatibility with byte-type vector inputs. Note that the enabler byte input parameter is included as byte for potential byte-based operations. This modification would not affect the function but it is essential for compatibility with standard logic types.### Please note that, this code snippet is specific to your question and may need adjustments for a wider or more generalized context.
