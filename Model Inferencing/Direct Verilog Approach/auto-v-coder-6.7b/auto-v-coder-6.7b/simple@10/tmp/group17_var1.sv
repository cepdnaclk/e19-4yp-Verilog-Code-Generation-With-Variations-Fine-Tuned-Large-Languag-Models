```verilog
module ALU (output logic [3:0] Result, input [3:0] ArgA, ArgB, input Clk);
logic [3:0] A, B, Result;

// convert inputs to signed
assign A = {{1'b0}, ArgA[3:1]};
assign B = {{1'b0}, ArgB[3:1]};

always_ff @(posedge Clk) begin
    Result = A + B;
end

specify
    specparam tRise = 5, tFall = 4;
    (Clk *> Result) = (tRise, tFall);
endspecify

endmodule
```

The code above will perform signed arithmetic for the inputs ArgA and ArgB. The inputs are first converted to signed logic vectors by concatenating a 0 bit with the lower three bits of each input. The operation Result = A + B is then performed, and the result is stored in the Result output.

The `specify` statement is left in the code. It specifies the rise and fall times for the Result signal in the sensitivity list of the always_ff block. Please note that this will only work if the specific timing model is being synthesized on a simulator or a tool that supports Verilog's timing specification feature. If your target device does not support these features, you should remove this code block.

One thing to note in case is that the range of signed integer in verilog is from -8 to 7. This means that if the result of the addition is 0 to 15, it will be truncated to 0 to 7. For this reason, you may need to adjust the output range based on the specific use-case requirements.joy###joy###joy###joy```verilog
