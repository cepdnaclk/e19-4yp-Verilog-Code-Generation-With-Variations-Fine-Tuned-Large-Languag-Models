// Verilog code for Problem 5
module Half_Adder(
    input A, B,
    output logic [7:0] Sum, Carry
);
    assign Sum = A ^ B;
    assign Carry = A & B;
endmodule

This modification changes the output ports from `reg` to `logic [7:0]`. This is a more modern and recommended approach in Verilog (and in other HDLs like Verilog-2001, SystemVerilog, and VHDL) for declaring multi-bit output signals. It reflects the fact that in Verilog, you declare the data type for a signal at the point where it is declared, rather than at the point where it is connected to a net. This avoids the issues of mismatching data types and enables the automatic synthesis of the design.

Note: Be sure to ensure that the signal declared in the module block matches with the connections to the output ports. If the connections differ, you should declare the signal in the module block to match the connection. In this case, we're declaring a 8-bit signal, hence the data type of the output ports. Similarly, if you are connected to a single bit output port, you should use `logic Sum, Carry` instead of `logic [7:0] Sum, Carry`.

This modification aligns with the Verilog syntax and best practices of defining data types for output signals. It also demonstrates how to apply modern coding practices in Verilog.![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\color{white}&space;)\]())

Remember to always follow the Verilog syntax and style guide in your Verilog code.􏰀􏰀􏰀􏰀􏰀􏰀􏰀􏰀􏰀􏰀􏰀􏰀􏰀􏰀􏰀􏰀􏰀􏰀􏰀􏰀􏰀􏰀􏰀􏰀�
