```verilog
class SchedDelayClass;
    reg a, b;
    function new();
        a = 1'b0;
        b = 1'b0;
    endfunction
endclass

module SchedDelayA;
  SchedDelayClass handle;
  initial begin
    handle = new();
    $display("a before: %b, b before: %b", handle.a, handle.b);
    handle.a = 1'b1;
    $display("a after: %b, b after: %b", handle.a, handle.b);
  end
endmodule
```
In this modified code, `SchedDelayClass` is a class that contains two registers `a` and `b`. The `new` function is the constructor that sets `a` and `b` to `0` at the time of initialization.

The `SchedDelayA` module creates an object `handle` of the class `SchedDelayClass`, then sets its `a` to `1'b1` before displaying its `a` and `b` values. 

This code demonstrates the class-based associative access to module inputs in Verilog. In Verilog, module inputs are not associated with a class. However, with this method, we can create objects and access their variables from an external script. This can be beneficial for testing the logic in Verilog with external scripts.

Remember that this is a basic demonstration and actual implementation may require changes according to the specific requirements of the project. Also, this code does not contain any real hardware implementation and is just for demonstration purposes.

Please note that this example is also a basic concept. The use of classes in this context may not be the best method in a bigger system due to their complexity and potential performance impact. In a real-world situation, the use of classes should be carefully considered based on the specific requirements and constraints of the design. 

Finally, this example does not contain any testbench or stimulus. To test this design in a hardware simulator, a testbench with a stimulus is needed. In a more complete system, the `initial` block might look something like:
```verilog
initial begin
  handle = new();
  repeat(10) @(posedge clk) begin
    handle.a = a;
