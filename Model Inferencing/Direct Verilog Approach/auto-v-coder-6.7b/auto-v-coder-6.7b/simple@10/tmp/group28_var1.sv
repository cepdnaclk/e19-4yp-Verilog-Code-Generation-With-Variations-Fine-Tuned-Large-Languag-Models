```verilog
wire [3:0] Sum, RegSum;
wire [3:0] ld[2];
wire [2:0] wr_addr;

reg4 R1 (Sum, Clock, Reset, RegSum);
assign ld = {4'b0000, RegSum};

ld_ram LR1 (ld, wr_addr, Clock, Reset, Sum);

assign Sum = Data + RegSum;
```
Note: 
1. The ld array is a wire type array with 2 elements.
2. The wr_addr is a wire type signal.
3. ld_ram is a module, which has inputs ld, wr_addr, Clock, Reset and output Sum. It's a simulation code, and doesn't exist in the base Verilog standard.
4. The rest code stays the same.
5. This code is for a simulation platform. The actual implementation might have slightly different considerations.

Remember, it’s important to note there is no direct way to "wire-array" in Verilog. Wires are simply a single vector, not an array, and cannot be changed by an assignment statement. However, it’s still possible to do operations between a wire and an array (which could be seen as assigning one wire to each element of the array) or between an array and another array (by applying the binary operator to each element). In your case, ld[2] is a wire type array and you can assign a wire to it. However, that would not provide you with the functionality you're looking for. It might not be an error or limitation, but rather just a limitation of the language.

The ld_ram is a module that simulates loading operation. This is only used for simulation, and not required to simulate the functionality of the actual module. 

This code is just an example and won't work in a real hardware design due to the missing implementation of ld_ram function.

Remember to add it in your actual hardware design accordingly based on its functionality. This code demonstrates how to use arrays that can be seen as wires in Verilog.
