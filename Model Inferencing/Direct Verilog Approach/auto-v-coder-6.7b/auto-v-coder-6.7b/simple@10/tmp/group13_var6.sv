module Half_Adder(
    input logic [7:0] A, B,
    output logic [7:0] Sum, Carry
);
    assign Sum = A ^ B;
    assign Carry = A & B;
endmodule

Here, I assumed that the inputs and outputs are 8-bit instead of single bit. However, this does not affect the functionality of the half adder. 

In a real application, you would want to ensure that the input and output signals are compatible with the application. In this example, we don't need to specify the width of the input and output signals. They're automatically set to match the width of the internal signals in the module.

Keep in mind that this is a simple half adder. A full adder may need additional input from a carry in (Cin), and the sum and carry out (Sum and Cout) are connected to the carry in of the next adder. 

If you need a carry out to be generated from the full adder, you may need to add logic inside the module to handle that. This modification was done to better align with the question description.### Alternate Code:

module Half_Adder(
    input logic A, B,
    output logic Sum, Carry
);
    assign Sum = A ^ B;
    assign Carry = A & B;
endmodule

This code is a bit more straightforward and can be used for a single-bit adder. Again, the inputs and outputs are declared as logic type by default. This version of the adder is suitable for a single-bit operation. It could be used to construct a multi-bit adder by connecting the output of the first adder to the carry in of the next adder, and so on. 

The adder module is designed to perform the sum and carry logic for two single-bit inputs. If you want to use this functionality for a multi-bit operation, you can simply use this module as is, or create a multi-bit version of this module by connecting the output of multiple instances of it together.

Keep in mind that this code is a simple implementation and may not cover all possible corner cases. For example, it does not provide a way to handle overflow, or handle other potential issues with multi-bit addition. These aspects should be taken into account when using this
