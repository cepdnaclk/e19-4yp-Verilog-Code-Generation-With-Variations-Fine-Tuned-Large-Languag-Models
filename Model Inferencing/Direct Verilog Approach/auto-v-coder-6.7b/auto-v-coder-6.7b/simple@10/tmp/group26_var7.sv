```verilog
// Unpacked structures as output
typedef struct packed {
   logic a0;
   logic a1;
} AOut;

typedef struct packed {
   logic b0;
   logic b1;
} BOut;

module gade(a,a1,b,c,b1,c1);
input BOut b,c,b1,c1;
output AOut a,a1;

// Instantiate OR gate with inertial delay 3
or #3 gg1(a1.a1,c1.c1,b1.b1);
// Instantiate AND gate with rise=2, fall=1 inertial delay
and #(2,1) gg2(a.a0,c.c0,b.b0);

endmodule
```
The `typedef struct` statement is used to create a new type that is an unpacked structure. In this case, we created `AOut` and `BOut` types. They both have a single bit output.

The `.` operator is used to access the fields of the structure.

Note: Please replace `a`, `b`, `c`, `a1`, `b1`, `c1` with your actual signal names. Also, use `#(rise,fall) gg2(out,in1,in2)` syntax to instantiate delay elements with custom rise and fall values.

In this modified code, we're treating the output of the module as `AOut` type, which holds two output bits. Similarly, we're treating the input of the module as `BOut` type, which holds two input bits. 

This will help you understand how to handle nested unpacked structures in Verilog. 

This modification of the code will not change the behavior of the module but it will allow us to test the handling of unpacked structures in the design. It's just a way to test the unpacked structure handling in Verilog.

Remember to replace `gg2` with the appropriate delay element model and parameters, `out`, `in1`, `in2`, `a.a0`, `c.c0`, `b.b0`, `a1.
