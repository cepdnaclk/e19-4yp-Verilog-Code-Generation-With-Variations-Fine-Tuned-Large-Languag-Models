```verilog
module tst_dff_pbeh();
  logic di,clk; wire do;
  dff_p d1(do,di,clk); // Instantiate DFF with path delay
  initial begin clk=0; di=1'b0; #35 $stop; end // Initialize & stop
  always #3 clk=~clk; // Generate clock (negedges at 6, 12, 18...)
  always #5 di=~di; // Toggle data
  initial $monitor($time,"clk=%b, di=%b, do=%b",clk,di,do);
endmodule
```
In this code, di and clk have been changed from `reg` to `logic`, and the code is ready to be used with SystemVerilog (IEEE 1364-1995). Verilog is still a common language used in many designs and it's good practice to specify types for the ports and signals to make your design more portable. This modification will make the code compatible with SystemVerilog. However, it should be noted that the use of `logic` and `wire` is discouraged in modern Verilog because they are not strictly standard and may not behave as expected in some synthesis tools. The recommended approach is to use `reg` and `wire` only when necessary.

Please remember that `logic` is a keyword in Verilog and has different semantics from SystemVerilog, which is why this change is necessary when you want to ensure compatibility with both Verilog and SystemVerilog. This code is designed to function in both Verilog and SystemVerilog without any issues, although the `reg` and `wire` keywords should be used with caution in future projects.

For Verilog compatibility, the following code is also provided:
```verilog
module tst_dff_pbeh();
  reg di,clk; wire do;
  dff_p d1(do,di,clk); // Instantiate DFF with path delay
  initial begin clk=0; di=1'b0; #35 $stop; end // Initialize & stop
  always #3 clk=~cl
