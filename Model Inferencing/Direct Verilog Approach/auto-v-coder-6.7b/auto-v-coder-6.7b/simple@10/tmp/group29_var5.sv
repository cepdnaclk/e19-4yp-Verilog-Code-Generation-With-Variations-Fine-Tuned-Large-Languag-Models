```verilog
class SchedDelayA;
    reg a, b;

    function new;
        a = 0;
        b = 0;
    endfunction

    function void set_a(input reg val);
        a = val;
    endfunction

    function void set_b(input reg val);
        b = val;
    endfunction

    function reg get_a;
        get_a = a;
    endfunction

    function reg get_b;
        get_b = b;
    endfunction

endclass

module top;
    SchedDelayA instance = new;

    initial begin
        instance.set_b(1);
        $display("Value of a after set b: %d", instance.get_a());

        instance.set_a(0);
        $display("Value of b after set a: %d", instance.get_b());
    end
endmodule
```
In this code, `SchedDelayA` is a class that simulates the behavior of a Verilog module with `a` and `b` reg inputs. The class includes methods to set and get values of the inputs. The top module is using this class and testing its functionality. 

Running this code will print the values of `a` and `b` both after changing their values. The output will vary according to the order of the set operations inside the initial block of the module. This code effectively demonstrates that you can use the class handle and associated array to manipulate the reg inputs. However, this is not exactly the same as the base Verilog code.

This is a variation of the base code but implemented in Verilog class-based way for better encapsulation and reusability. It includes class initialization, methods to set and get values, and a test block inside a module to showcase the functionality.

Note: The output of this code will also depend on the state of the simulation outside of the module, which is not shown in the base code. The given code will fail if run immediately, as there is no simulation to observe the changes of `a` and `b`. You might need to use a debugger to observe the values. Also, the `$display` call inside the initial block of the module is a placeholder to display simulation results.
