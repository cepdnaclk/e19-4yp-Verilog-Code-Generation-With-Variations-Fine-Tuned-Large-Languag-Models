```verilog
// Structure for storing parameters for gate delays
typedef struct packed {
  int s_delay;
  int c_delay;
} Delays;

module ha_1(s,ca,a,b); // Half Adder with gate delays
  parameter Delays delays = '{1,2}; // Default values
  input a,b; output s,ca;
  xor #(delays.s_delay) (s,a,b);
  and #(delays.c_delay) (ca,a,b);
endmodule
```
This code allows the gate delays to be set dynamically at compile time using an unpacked structure. The `Delays` structure can be instantiated to an instance of the `ha_1` module and the `delays` parameter can be overridden to change the gate delays. This opens up more flexibility for dynamically changing the gate delays at runtime.

Remember to connect the delays structure to the `delays` parameter using a unique module instance for each module instantiation. This means that each module instance may have its own gate delays.

```verilog
// Example Instantiation:
Delays delays_instance = '{1,10}; // Override the gate delay values
ha_1 instance1(.delays(delays_instance),.a(1'b0),.b(1'b1),.s(),.ca());
```
The above code instantiates the `ha_1` module with overridden gate delays. It's also worth mentioning that if the gate delays are too large (compared to the delay of the input signals) it might be beneficial to reduce the clock frequency or increase the clock resolution. This way, the gate delays can be met more consistently.

Note that this code is a Verilog-2001 construct and may not work with earlier versions of Verilog or Verilog-AMS. Therefore, it's a good practice to consider supporting tool's capabilities and documentation when using parameterized structures.```verilog

  int s_delay;
  int c_delay;
} Delays;
