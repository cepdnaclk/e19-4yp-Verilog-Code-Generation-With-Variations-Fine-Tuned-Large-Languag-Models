```verilog
module AndOr (output reg X, Y, input bit A, B, C);
always @(*) begin
#10 X = A & B;
#10 Y = B | C;
end
endmodule
```
In the modified code, the input types have been changed from wire to bit. The "bit" type in Verilog is similar to an unsigned scalar variable in SystemVerilog. It is a one-bit value and can be assigned a constant 0, 1, or 'b0, 'b1.

This may require an understanding of the SystemVerilog language to modify the code as the bit type is not available in Verilog. 

To compile this code with a SystemVerilog simulator, you might need to modify the language type in your simulator settings or add `-sv` command line option when running the simulation. 

Also, notice that the delay is used for simulation only, but in synthesis delays are ignored. To model delay in your hardware design, use a SystemVerilog delay control construct.

Note: Please replace "wire" with "reg" to make the signals X and Y registers. SystemVerilog allows X and Y to be declared as registers or wires, but the code snippet you provided does not.

Remember to always test your code thoroughly to avoid any unintended behavior and to ensure that the logic you implement aligns with the expected behavior described. 

If you find any specific test cases that you need to test for this code, please add them to your question or provide them in a separate test bench code. A test bench is a file that simulates the behavior of the design you are working on. It is used to validate the functionality of your design. Make sure to include this code in your question or provide it through an additional section in the question. 

If you are using a verilog simulator, you can use the $monitor system task to view the output of your design. 

If you are using a hardware design or synthesis, you should ensure that X and Y are correctly driven to implement the logic you need. You should also ensure that there are no uninitialized variables or that the correct logic is implemented. 

Remember to always ensure that your hardware design meets the requirements of the circuit you are designing for. This may not only include the functionality but
