```verilog
module gade(a,a1,b,c,b1,c1);
input [1:0] b;
input [1:0] c;
input [1:0] b1;
input [1:0] c1;
output [1:0] a;
output [1:0] a1;
// Instantiate OR gate with inertial delay 3
or #3 gg1(a1,c1,b1);
// Instantiate AND gate with rise=2, fall=1 inertial delay
and #(2,1) gg2(a,c,b);
endmodule
```
In this modified code, the inputs and outputs of the module are declared as unpacked arrays of 2 bits each. This should help us test the functionality of nested unpacked structures in Verilog.

Please note that this code is just a sample and may not exactly fit your specific requirement. The actual implementation can vary depending on your specific requirements. Also, ensure that the input and output types are compatible with the architecture you're targeting. 

The main point to note is the use of unpacked arrays in the inputs and outputs of the module. You can change the bit width of the arrays to test different scenarios. The rise and fall times can also be adjusted as needed to test different timing scenarios. This code also demonstrates how we can handle unpacked structures in Verilog. 

The code is self-explanatory and can be altered as per requirements. If you need more help or have more specific questions, please don't hesitate to ask.```verilog
