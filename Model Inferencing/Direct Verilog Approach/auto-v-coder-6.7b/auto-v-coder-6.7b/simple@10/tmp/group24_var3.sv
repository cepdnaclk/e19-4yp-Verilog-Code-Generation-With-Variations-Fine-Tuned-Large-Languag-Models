```verilog
module Anding #(
    parameter type t = logic
) (input t a, b, output t y);
and (y, a, b);
endmodule

module TestUnion;
typedef enum { S_IDLE, S_BUSY } state_t;
typedef union packed {
    state_t state;
    logic [1:0] bits;
} packed_union_t;

packed_union_t status;
Anding #(packed_union_t) dff_inst(.a(status.state),.b(status.state),.y(status.state));
endmodule
```
In this code, we modified the `dff_inst` declaration to use the custom `packed_union_t` type for both input and output ports. This can be useful when we need to handle union types in module ports. Please note that this modification might not work as is, as Verilog does not support union types as module port types. However, it serves as a demonstration of how we might adjust a module to handle union types in the future. For the current toolchain, a proper synthesis will need to be performed using appropriate tools such as Synopsys Design Compiler or ModelSim/Verilator.

Also note that in the original code, the input and output ports are not connected in the same way, but in this code, we do so without changing the structure of the module. Also, this might not behave as expected since Verilog does not natively support union types in module port declarations. The behavior of this code will depend on the specific Verilog simulator being used.

For real-world use, it is recommended to use a more appropriate language, such as C++/Python, or hardware description languages that support Verilog HDL features, such as CERNET or Lattice Diamond. Diamond (a Verilog design environment) provides Verilog-AMS support, which is more flexible than standard Verilog syntax. It supports data types like union as well as other advanced features.

Finally, this code is just a demonstration of how one might approach the problem, and it is not guaranteed to work in all Verilog simulators. It's always better to use a proper synthesis tool to synthesize the design. In general, the synthesis tool will provide
