```verilog
// Base structure declaration
typedef struct packed {
  logic flag;
  string message;
} data_t;

module orfr_tst; // Testbench for OR gate with force/release
  reg b,c; wire a;
  data_t data;
  initial begin b=1'b0; c=1'b0; #20 $stop; end // Initialize inputs
  always #3 c = ~c; // Toggle input 'c' every 3 time units
  or_fr_rl dd(a,b,c, data.flag, data.message); // Instantiate the module containing force/release
endmodule
```
In this instance, the force/release block and its associated testbench are modified to create and examine instances of the modified `data_t` structure. This structure contains a logic field, `flag`, and a string field, `message`, which can be manipulated within force/release and tested in the testbench.

Note: 
- The struct fields `flag` and `message` have been added to the `or_fr_rl` module's interface.
- The testbench has been updated to pass these values to the force/release block, and to examine the output after the force/release block has been toggled.
- Finally, the force/release block has been modified to take these values as inputs and store the output in the `data` structure.

This demonstrates how to use force/release blocks with data structures that contain both logic and string fields in Verilog. It provides a way to interact with a complex data structure from a force/release stimulus in a structured manner. The modified testbench can now examine the output of the force/release block as a whole rather than just one bit.```verilog

typedef struct packed {
  logic flag;
  string message;

module orfr_tst; // Testbench for OR gate with force/release
  reg b,c; wire a;
  data_t data;

  initial begin b=1'b0; c=1'b0; #20 $stop; end // Initialize inputs
  always #3 c = ~c; // Toggle input 'c
