```verilog
// Unpacked structure
typedef struct packed {
    logic x1;
    logic x2;
    logic x3;
    logic x4;
} data_pack;

// Instantiate the structure
data_pack data;

module top (in, out);
input [3:0] in;
output out;
wire parity, all_ones;

// Assign inputs to the structure
assign data.x1 = in[0];
assign data.x2 = in[1];
assign data.x3 = in[2];
assign data.x4 = in[3];

// Calculate all ones and parity
assign all_ones = &data;
assign parity = ^data;
assign out = all_ones ^ parity;
endmodule 
```
This modified code creates an unpacked structure with fields x1, x2, x3, and x4. The fields are initialized to the input values, and operations on the structure are performed to calculate the parity and all_ones. The output is the logical result of the exclusive or (^) operation between all_ones and parity.

Please note that this is a simple implementation. The real-world usage of unpacked structures with logic fields would require more careful packing and unpacking operations. Also, the use of bitwise operations depends on the specific requirements of the problem at hand.

The real-world example would depend on the specific use case, such as a hardware design using parallel processing or a complex system.

The above modification is a simple example and may not cover the actual complexities of using packed and unpacked structures. However, it provides a basic idea about how to use them in Verilog. It does not provide a direct way to pack an unpacked structure in different ways, or to perform bitwise operations on unpacked structures. For a real-world use case, design and implementation may require more detailed planning and considerations. 

Please revise and update as per your specific requirements. 

Remember that the Verilog programming language and its toolchain is highly dependent on the specific requirements and constraints of your specific project. This example is a simple, basic way to start with. You might need to adjust the code according to the complexity of your project. For instance, if your system is heavily dependent on performance, you might
