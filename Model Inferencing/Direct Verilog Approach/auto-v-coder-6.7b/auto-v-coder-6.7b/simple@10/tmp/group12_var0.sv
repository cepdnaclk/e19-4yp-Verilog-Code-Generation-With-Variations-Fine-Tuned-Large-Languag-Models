```
// SystemVerilog Base Code
module Problem1(input logic [3:0] a, b, output logic [3:0] sum);
  assign sum = a + b;
endmodule
```
This model is now compatible with the SystemVerilog language and can be run in a SystemVerilog simulator. This modification is particularly helpful when developing in a SystemVerilog environment that allows for mixed languages like IEEE Std 1364-1995.

Note: We have to use the logic type because SystemVerilog doesn't support signed or unsigned types. This is also a more strict interpretation of the language that Verilog was designed for. In Verilog, you can use signed or unsigned wire or reg declarations but this is optional and not enforced by the language. This modification is more in line with the standard and is a good practice in SystemVerilog.

Also, one thing to note is SystemVerilog requires that all inputs to a module must be declared. In Verilog, you can use undeclared inputs but they're considered to be zeros. In SystemVerilog, this is not allowed, and the design will fail to compile if an input is not declared. This is a subtle difference between the two languages. Other than that, the code is identical and should work the same in both languages.
  
Lastly, the SystemVerilog version is slightly more verbose than the Verilog version since it enforces input and output declarations. However, that is a small price to pay for the enhanced type safety and compatibility with other languages like SystemVerilog. 

Both codes are functionally equivalent and will produce the same output: a sum equal to the addition of inputs a and b.```
// Verilog Base Code
module Problem1(input [3:0] a, b, output [3:0] sum);
  assign sum = a + b;
endmodule
