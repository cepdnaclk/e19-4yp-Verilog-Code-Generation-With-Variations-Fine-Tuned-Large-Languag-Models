```verilog
module netdelay1(x,y);
input wire [31:0] x;
output reg [31:0] y;
wire #(2,1) nn; // Declare wire 'nn' with rise=2, fall=1 delay
not (nn,x); // Assign NOT(x) to 'nn' (takes effect after rise/fall delay)
assign y=nn; // Assign 'nn' to 'y' (direct assignment)
endmodule
```
This modification will allow the Testbench to test the 32-bit output of the NOT gate individually, rather than needing to check all bits together. This will be particularly useful when working with packed structures in Verilog.

Please also note that you must update the test bench accordingly to test the individual bits of the output.

```verilog
module testbench;
reg [31:0] x;
wire [31:0] y;
netdelay1 dut(.x(x),.y(y));
integer i;
initial begin
    x = 0;
    repeat(32) begin
        #10;
        x = x + 1;
    end
    $finish;
end
initial begin
    $dumpfile("netdelay1.vcd");
    $dumpvars(0, testbench);
end
endmodule
```
This test bench will generate a waveform that will detail the individual transitions of each bit of x and y. It’s important to note that Verilog doesn’t have a direct way to display individual bits of a packed structure. However, using SystemVerilog, which extends Verilog, we can do this by using foreach loop to display every bit of the result. 

Please note that this modification is only valid in SystemVerilog. For pure Verilog, there is no such feature to handle individual bits of a packed structure directly. The original code provided is the same for both Verilog and SystemVerilog. In Verilog, we cannot use SystemVerilog extension features. For Verilog, you can only display the whole packed structure at once. So, the original code is completely correct for both Verilog and SystemVerilog.### Wrapping Up:
