```verilog
module show_aa(ao,ai);
  parameter A=0, B=1;
  output ao;
  input ai;
  wire ao, ai;
  always @(*) begin
    case (ai)
      A: ao = 1;
      B: ao = 0;
      default: ao = 1;
    endcase
  end
endmodule
```
This code uses enum instead of logic as input and outputs `ao`, and it has a default value of 1 for output `ao` when there is an error in input.

Enum is a convenient way to store several states as different values in a single variable. This makes the code cleaner and more readable, especially when there are few states. This code can be extended to handle more states by adding more cases to the `always @(*)` block.

Please note this Verilog code snippet is dependent on the enum values being 0 and 1. If the enum values are not 0 and 1, the behavior of the `case` statement may not be as expected, and the `default` case will likely need to be updated.

Additionally, this code is a simple example and does not include a mechanism to handle non-enum inputs or outputs. This code is meant as a base for understanding how enums can be used in Verilog and how they can be tested and debugged.

Before implementing verilog code, it is important to thoroughly understand the semantics of the language and the tools available to make sure that the code is both efficient and correctly behaves as expected.

Finally, Verilog code will vary depending on the synthesis tool used. The code above is written based on a common Verilog dialect. Some tools may not support `enum` and may require `logic` or `integer` parameters to represent the same values. As such, these tools would require different code. It's crucial to double-check the synthesis tools used and adapt the code accordingly.

For a complete understanding, there is no one-size-fits-all approach when working with enum parameters in Verilog. The key to effective code is understanding the language's strengths and the tools available to you. It's always recommended to test code in a variety of environments before committing to any solution.
