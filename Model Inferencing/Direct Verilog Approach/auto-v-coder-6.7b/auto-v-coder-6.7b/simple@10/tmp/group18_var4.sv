```verilog
/* NOT gate with delay 2 */

module show_aa(ao,ai);
  enum logic [1:0] {A, B} ai;
  enum logic [1:0] {C, D} ao;
  always_comb begin
    case (ai)
      A: ao = D;
      B: ao = C;
      default: ao = D;
    endcase
  end
endmodule
```

In this modified code, the inputs `ai` and `ao` are enumerated and are `A` and `B` respectively. This makes it easier to test the logic and timing of the NOT gate with delay 2. The outputs are also enumerated to be `C` and `D`. This allows for testing of the default case and non-default case for the inputs. 

This makes the code more systematic and easier to test by enumerating the inputs and outputs. Remember, enum type can be treated as logic in Verilog. 

Note that the default case in the `case` statement in the `always_comb` block is set to D, which makes `C` the output in the case when `ai` does not match `A` or `B`. This ensures that the `ao` output always has a value. 

The use of enum in the context of Verilog is a great way to make the code more systematic and testable by enumerating the inputs and outputs. It also makes the code easier to debug, as you can more easily see the mapping from one set of values to another. In general, it's a good practice to use enumerated types wherever possible in Verilog for this reason.

Remember to import the necessary packages based on the enum usage. In this case, no external packages are used. If you are going to use enum as bit types, you need to import enum package. Also, keep in mind that enum is used to control the values of variables, not variables. However, there is a way to use enum as variable. If you want to assign enum values to a wire or output, you can't directly do that but you can create a new wire or output variable and assign enum values to it. 

If you are using enum values as inputs and outputs in the same always block, you can do it. However,
