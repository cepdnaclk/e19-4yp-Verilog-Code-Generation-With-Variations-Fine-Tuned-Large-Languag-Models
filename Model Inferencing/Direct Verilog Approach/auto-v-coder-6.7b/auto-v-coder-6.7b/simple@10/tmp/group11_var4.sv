```verilog
module DataComponent (DataIn, DataOut, ControlSignals);
parameter type DataType = struct {
    bit [7:0] data;
    rand bit [7:0] rand_data;
};

typedef struct packed {
    bit [7:0] data;
    rand bit [7:0] rand_data;
} DataType;

input DataType DataIn;
output DataType DataOut;
input ControlSignals;

endmodule
```
This modification involves creating a struct including a rand member, and then redefining it to be a `packed struct` which is similar to a struct in C and Verilog. The `rand` keyword is used to set the member of the struct as a random variable. Now, the `DataType` structure now has a random member, which allows for randomization during the simulation.

Please note that randomization of rand variables is a complex issue and requires a careful design to ensure the correct functioning of rand variables. For this purpose, we need to use SystemVerilog's randomness functionalities, which are not directly compatible with Verilog. Therefore, this example demonstrates the use of SystemVerilog features in Verilog, but it should be used with SystemVerilog simulators for accurate results. This code does not guarantee the correct functioning of randomization for Verilog simulator.

This code is a starting point for understanding and implementing randomization in Verilog. For full randomization, you may need to use SystemVerilog to implement the rand variables and the randomize() function, which is used to drive the values of rand variables. In a full-fledged project, this code should be adapted to the specific needs and requirements of the design.```verilog
module DataComponent (DataIn, DataOut, ControlSignals);
parameter type DataType = struct {
    bit [7:0] data;
    rand bit [7:0] rand_data;
};

typedef struct packed {
    bit [7:0] data;
    rand bit [7:0] rand_data;
} DataType;

input DataType DataIn;
output DataType DataOut;
input ControlSignals;
