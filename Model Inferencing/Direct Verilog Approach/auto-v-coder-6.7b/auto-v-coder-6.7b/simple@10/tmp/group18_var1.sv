```verilog
enum bit [1:0] {A=2'b01, B=2'b10} Ai, Bi;
wire [1:0] Ao;

always @ (Ai, Bi) begin
    case({Ai,Bi})
        2'b01 :Ao = A;
        2'b10 :Ao = B;
        default:Ao = A;
    endcase
end
```
In the above code, we've replaced the `logic` data type with a packed enum. The `Ai` and `Bi` are enum inputs to the module. The `Ao` is the enum output. We use a `case` statement to assign `Ao` to the appropriate value based on the logic expression of `Ai` and `Bi`. The `default` case is for any other combinations of `Ai` and `Bi`.

Please note that the behavior of the Verilog code might change depending on the synthesis tool you are using. Some synthesis tools might optimize the case statement differently or might not support enum at all, so it's recommended to test the code in a supported synthesis environment.

The value of `Ao` is determined by the value of `Ai` and `Bi` with the following rule:
- If `Ai` and `Bi` are both `1`, then `Ao` will be `A`.
- If `Ai` and `Bi` are both `0`, then `Ao` will be `A`.
- If `Ai` is `1` and `Bi` is `0`, then `Ao` will be `B`.
- If `Ai` is `0` and `Bi` is `1`, then `Ao` will be `B`.
- For any other combination, `Ao` will be `A`.

In this case, it doesn't change the result of the NOT gate as the enum values are equivalent to 0 (A) and 1 (B). The delay is still 2 clock cycles due to the NOT gate.

Remember that the logic for determining `Ao` could be different when the enumerated values are used. The example provided is a simplified example. The actual logic can be more complex
