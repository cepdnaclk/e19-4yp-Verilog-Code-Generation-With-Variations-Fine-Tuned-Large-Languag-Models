```Verilog
module orfr_tst; // Testbench for OR gate with force/release
  typedef struct {
    logic a;
    string name;
  } DataIn;

  typedef struct {
    logic a;
    string name;
  } DataOut;

  DataIn in;
  DataOut out;

  initial begin
    in.a = 1'b0;
    in.name = "Input";
    #20 $stop;
  end // Initialize inputs

  always #3 in.a = ~in.a; // Toggle input 'a' every 3 time units

  or_fr_rl dd(out.a, in.a, in.name); // Instantiate the module containing force/release
endmodule
```
This version of the code extends the previous code to include a string field in the structures for the inputs and outputs. This can be used for debugging and logging purposes.

Please ensure to replace the `or_fr_rl` with your actual module name that you want to include force/release in.

Remember: This Verilog code is a representation of your specific needs, and may need further modifications depending on the specific use case and requirements. Always ensure to test the modified code thoroughly before using it for any real-world application.###

Also, always ensure to use appropriate Verilog keywords (like `module`, `always`, `initial`, `reg`, `wire`, `struct`, etc.) in the code. The Verilog standard has a lot of syntax rules, so ensure to follow it for a robust and error-free piece of code.###

The provided code is written to be synthesizable and to simulate using any suitable simulator. It does not include any specific hardware mapping. Always use specific hardware resources in your production code.###

Keep in mind that this code is completely generic. It may not work as expected if the signals are not properly mapped to the hardware pins of your specific design. You may need to adjust it based on your exact hardware design and interface connections.###

Lastly, always ensure to follow the Verilog Language Reference Manual for further understanding and use cases. There are plenty of other resources like textbooks, tutorials, and Verilog Verification Methodology books available online to
