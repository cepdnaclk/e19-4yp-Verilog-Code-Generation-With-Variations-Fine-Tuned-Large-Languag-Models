```verilog
module DataComponent (DataIn, DataOut, ControlSignals);
input [7:0] DataIn;
output [7:0] DataOut;
input ControlSignals;
struct {
  rand bit [7:0] Data;
} data_struct;
assign DataOut = data_struct.Data;
initial begin
  $display("Randomized DataIn: %0b, ControlSignals: %0b", data_struct.Data, ControlSignals);
end
endmodule
```
In this variation, we have introduced a struct with a rand data member. This will allow us to randomize the struct. The output 'DataOut' now corresponds to the randomized data member from the struct, and the initial block is used to display the randomized values. Please note that in order to randomize a struct, you need to first create an instance of the struct. In the above code, we are creating an instance data_struct. This instance is then used to access the randomize function and the data member. The randomized data is then assigned to the DataOut output. 

This struct can be used as a data structure in the Verilog module to facilitate randomization.

Also, randomization of Verilog struct is not as simple as randomization of a single data type. It can lead to complexities while dealing with hierarchical structures. It's advisable to use a more user-friendly approach like arrays or individual values, depending on the specific needs of the design.

One should note that the randomization process for the Verilog struct introduces a level of complexity in the design flow. For this reason, it is recommended to ensure that the design is correctly randomized before it is synthesized and implemented.

The testbench can use the $random function to generate random values and apply them to the struct members.

```verilog
initial begin
  data_struct.Data = $random % 256;
  // $random generates a random number between 0 and 2^31-1
  // Taking modulo 256, we get the random number less than or equal to 255
  // We can use the % operator to generate an unsigned number less than or equal to Max.
end
```
Remember to call `data_struct.randomize()` method to
