```SystemVerilog
module Problem1(input logic [3:0] a, b, output logic [3:0] sum);
  assign sum = a + b;
endmodule
```
This code is a SystemVerilog module that adds two 4-bit binary numbers A and B and assigns the result to sum. "logic" types are used for the inputs and output in the module declaration. This variation allows you to test SystemVerilog compatibility with the module. Replace 'Problem1' with your system verilog module name if it is different.### Note: Make sure that your Verilog simulation tool supports SystemVerilog before using this code. If your tool does not support SystemVerilog, you will need to use Verilog for this assignment.

If you're new to SystemVerilog or Verilog, I suggest checking out the resources below:

1. IEEE 1800-2017: SystemVerilog IEEE Std 1800-2017, Standard for Verification of VHDL and SystemVerilog Codes
2. IEEE Std 1364-2005 SystemVerilog IEEE Standard.
3. Verilog Language Reference Manual by University of Paderborn.
4. SystemVerilog LRM: The IEEE Standard for SystemVerilog.

These resources should provide you with detailed information about using SystemVerilog in your projects.```SystemVerilog
module Problem1(input logic [3:0] a, b, output logic [3:0] sum);
  assign sum = a + b;
endmodule
```<API_RUN_STOP>! 

Please note that the SystemVerilog code will work in both Verilog and SystemVerilog simulations, as SystemVerilog is a superset of Verilog. If your simulation tool does not support SystemVerilog, you might need to use Verilog for this assignment.!

I hope this help clarify things for you and provide a solution to your problem. If you're still having trouble with the code, drop us a message and we'd be happy
