```verilog
module DFF #(parameter type T = int) (input T a, b, output T y, output T z);

typedef union packed {
        int a, b;
} u_t;

u_t in_packed;

assign in_packed.a = a;
assign in_packed.b = b;

always @ (posedge a or posedge b) begin
    y <= $display("y=%d, z=%d", y, z);
end

always @(*) begin
    z <= in_packed.a + in_packed.b;
end

endmodule
```
In this modified code, the DFF module has two input ports `a`, `b`, and outputs `y` and `z`. The `u_t` typedef is a packed union of `a` and `b`. The `in_packed` variable is an instance of the union type. The `a` and `b` inputs are assigned to `in_packed.a` and `in_packed.b` respectively.

The `y` output is updated each time `a` or `b` change (using `posedge`). Inside the `y` update block, the `$display` system task will output the value of `y` and `z` to the standard output.

The `z` output is updated each time the `u_t` union is updated (using `@(*)`). Inside the `z` update block, the value of `z` is set to the sum of `in_packed.a` and `in_packed.b`.
This allows to test union handling as well as to see the effect of changing `a` or `b`.### This code is provided as an example and may not fully satisfy your requirements. It is highly recommended to thoroughly test the code to ensure its functionality and to refine it according to your specific requirements.
