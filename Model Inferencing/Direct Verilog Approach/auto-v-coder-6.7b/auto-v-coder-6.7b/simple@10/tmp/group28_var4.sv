```verilog
module example3(Data, Clock, Reset, RegSum, Sum);
input Clock, Reset;
input [3:0] Data;
output [3:0] Sum;
output wire [3:0] RegSum [0:2];  // Changed output of RegSum to an array of wires
wire [3:0] Sum, RegSum;
reg4 R1 (Sum, Clock, Reset, RegSum);
assign Sum = Data + RegSum;
endmodule
```
This code is a modification of the original code. We have added an array of wires as output for RegSum which will hold 3 values and will be used to store the registers. The variable RegSum is now a 4-bit wire type array of size 2. 

The registers of the original example have been changed to a 4-bit wire type array of size 2. 

Also, ensure that the wire type of RegSum is a 4-bit wire type array of 2.

Please note that Verilog does not directly support wire-array assignment and the output variable type is also important. 

This modification is done to provide a way to test wire-array compatibility for the output of a module in Verilog. It may not be suitable for all scenarios due to the restrictions of Verilog.

In a real-world scenario, the output variable should be a wire type array with an unpacked dimension if the size of array is not a single value. 

The actual use of the output variable will depend on the design of the system or the requirements of the project.

The output wire-array is for testing and it may not be suitable for general use, but it can be used for testing or debugging purposes. It is highly recommended to use the original output wire type variable in a real-life design for readability and simplicity.

It's important to note that Verilog requires each output wire to be connected to a variable, so it's important to stick with the original wire type as shown in the original code, or use a more complex system if the need for an array is understood. 

Remember, Verilog is a hardware description language, and a significant part of its strength is its ability to describe hardware. As such, understanding the language is crucial for leveraging its benefits.
