```verilog
class ClassA;
  reg a;
  
  // Constructor
  function new(reg a);
    this.a = a;
  endfunction
  
  // Getter
  function reg getA();
    return a;
  endfunction
  
  // Setter
  function void setA(reg a);
    this.a = a;
  endfunction
  
  // Class method to print value of 'a'
  function void printA();
    $display("a = %0d", a);
  endfunction

endclass

module SchedDelayA;
  // Declaration of class handle
  ClassA objA;
  // Declaration of associative array
  associative array my_associative_array;

  initial begin
    // Instantiating the class
    objA = new(1);
    // Storing the class handle in associative array
    my_associative_array["keyA"] = objA;
    // Accessing the class handle in associative array
    my_associative_array["keyA"].printA();
  end
  
endmodule
```
This modified code does the following:
- Defines a class `ClassA`.
- Instantiates an object of class `ClassA` and stores it in an associative array.
- Accesses the object in the associative array.
- Calls the `printA` method of the class to display the value of 'a'.
- No other hardware is added or changed.### Additional Note:
The Verilog code provided here is a simple demonstration of the use of a class handle and an associative array. For a more extensive or complex use-case, additional design considerations and modifications may be needed according to the specific requirements. The code is designed to illustrate the concept and is not expected to synthesize or work as a physical circuit. In a real-world scenario, the hardware design and implementation would be significantly more complex and detailed.<API_RUN_STOP>!
