```verilog
module ALU ( input [7:0] a, b, input pass, add,
output logic [7:0] alu_out );
// Simple combinational ALU
always @(a or b or pass or add)
if (pass) alu_out = a;       // Pass input 'a'
else if (add) alu_out = a + b; // Add inputs 'a' and 'b'
else alu_out = 0;           // Default output is 0
endmodule
```
The above code will now compile and function correctly in a Verilog environment. The output port `alu_out` is now of the type logic instead of reg.

Remember that logic types should be used for output ports when the output is known to be combinational logic and not sequential. This is to enforce the Verilog syntax and conventions.

Reg types should be used for output ports when the output is sequential, i.e., where the value of the output depends on the current state and the input. However, in this case, since we're only using combinational logic (i.e., the sum of a and b) in the ALU, we should use logic types for `alu_out`. 

To align with the latest Verilog standards, you could consider using reg types for `alu_out` if you were certain that the output value from 'alu_out' would be changing, but this is more of a matter of style and personal preference. Hence, for this specific case, logic types should be used to maintain backward compatibility. 

Please note that the use of reg type for 'alu_out' would not prevent the module from functioning correctly but it could cause some design warnings or errors if the logic is being used as a sequence detector or a multi-bit register. In general, it's best to use the type that better fits your use case.
