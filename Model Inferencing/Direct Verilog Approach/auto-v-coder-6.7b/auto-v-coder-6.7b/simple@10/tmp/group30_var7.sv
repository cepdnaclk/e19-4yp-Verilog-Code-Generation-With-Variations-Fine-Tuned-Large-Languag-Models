```verilog
module netdelay1(x,y);
input [31:0] x;
output [31:0] y;
wire #(2,1) nn; // Declare wire 'nn' with rise=2, fall=1 delay
not (nn,x); // Assign NOT(x) to 'nn' (takes effect after rise/fall delay)
assign y=nn; // Assign 'nn' to 'y' (direct assignment)
endmodule
```

Note: This code represents a basic Verilog module. Please make sure to test the code in an appropriate simulator and synthesis tool before use. The original code is for a single bit input, while the modified code is for a 32-bit input. It's also worth mentioning that not all hardware synthesis tools support delay simulation on a per-bit basis. Some may only allow a single delay for a port or a whole module. Thus, the delay simulation on a single bit may not give accurate results in all cases. Always refer to the specific synthesis tool's documentation for supported delay simulation features.
