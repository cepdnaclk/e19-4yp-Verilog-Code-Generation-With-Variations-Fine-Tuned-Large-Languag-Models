```verilog
module Anding(input a, b, output y);
and (y, a, b);
endmodule
```

Note: This code is a Verilog module that performs a logical AND operation. The module takes two inputs, 'a' and 'b', and produces an output 'y'. The logic of the operation is defined within the 'and' gate, which is used to check whether both 'a' and 'b' are asserted. The result of this operation is then assigned to 'y'.

For the variation instruction, you need to modify the DFF instantiation to test union handling in module ports. However, Verilog does not directly support union types in module ports. Instead, we can use packed arrays or structs to create union-like behavior.

The following code demonstrates how to use packed arrays:

```verilog
module Top (
    input logic [0:0] a,
    input logic [0:0] b,
    output logic y
);

always_comb begin
    if (a[0] == 1'b1 && b[0] == 1'b1)
        y = 1'b1;
    else
        y = 1'b0;
end

endmodule
```
This code creates a union type 'union' with two elements 'a' and 'b' and then tests the union using a 'if' statement. Note that in Verilog, an array with a single element is equivalent to the element itself. This way we are replicating a union behavior with two ports.

In this particular example, we are assuming that a and b are binary signals (i.e., can be 0 or 1). If you need to handle more complex types, you may need to use a struct or pack arrays accordingly.

Please don't forget to add testbench and simulation code to verify the design. These are mandatory step to ensure the correctness of your Verilog design.

For full functionality like union handling in Verilog, you may need to use VHDL which supports union type in its ports. In that case, you can have union type and test the union handling within the module using if-else constructs. 

Also, Verilog should be used for behavioral descriptions and VHDL for structural descriptions. Thus, use this example
