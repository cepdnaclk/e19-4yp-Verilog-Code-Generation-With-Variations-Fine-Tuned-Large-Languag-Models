```
module AndOr (output bit X, Y, input bit A, B, C);
assign #10 X = A & B;
assign #10 Y = B | C;
endmodule
```
In the modified code, all the inputs and outputs are declared as bit type. This will help to simplify the model if you want to test the functionality of the design using SystemVerilog bit type. 

Notice that this does not change the behavior of the design, it only changes the type of the inputs and outputs to test the behavior of different types in SystemVerilog. In a real design, you would likely want to use the "bit" type for inputs and outputs since it is a 1-bit (one-state) value.

Also remember that SystemVerilog bit type is intended to be used with data lines and for small logic circuits where signal-level data and timing is critical. For high-speed interconnects, you would typically use the "wire" type. Hence, use this modified code rather than the base code for testing purposes.

And for the other usage, you can use the "wire" type without changing the behavior as the base code is already using "wire" type for all inputs and outputs. In this specific test case, we are just changing the input type for testing if that's causing any issues or not.

This modified version of the code is for SystemVerilog. If you are using Verilog, the "wire" type behaves the same as "logic" or "reg". If you want to test the bit type, the bit type in SystemVerilog works the same way as it does in Verilog. Just remember that bit is faster than wire in SystemVerilog for logic operations. However, in Verilog, bit acts like a regular data type. If you just want to test different usage of the bit type in SystemVerilog, you should use this modified code. 

Also, you can refer to the SystemVerilog Language Reference Manual for more detailed information about the "bit" and "wire" types. They are used for different purposes depending on the requirement of the design. This example doesn't demonstrate the usage of "bit" type in the way of being faster than "wire" in SystemVerilog. It's just a simple change to test the behavior of different types in SystemVerilog.
