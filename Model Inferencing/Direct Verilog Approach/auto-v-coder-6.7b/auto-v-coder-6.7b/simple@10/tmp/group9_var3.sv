```verilog
module Problem8(input [3:0] a, b, output [3:0] diff);
  
  struct packed {
    logic x, y, z;
  } packed_a, packed_b, packed_diff;

  assign packed_a.x = a[0];
  assign packed_a.y = a[1];
  assign packed_a.z = a[2];

  assign packed_b.x = b[0];
  assign packed_b.y = b[1];
  assign packed_b.z = b[2];

  assign packed_diff.x = packed_a.x - packed_b.x;
  assign packed_diff.y = packed_a.y - packed_b.y;
  assign packed_diff.z = packed_a.z - packed_b.z;

  assign diff[0] = packed_diff.x;
  assign diff[1] = packed_diff.y;
  assign diff[2] = packed_diff.z;

endmodule
```
In this modified code, I introduced a struct packed that includes the signals x, y, and z. The inputs are assigned to these signals, and the diff is calculated by subtracting the signals of the input arrays. The result is then assigned to the output diff.
  
In the current code, each bit of the input is directly subtracted from the corresponding bit of the input. In the modified code, each bit of the input is assigned to a separate x, y, and z signal, which can then be subtracted. This demonstrates the use of packed structures for signal handling in Verilog. It's a good practice to use packed structures for handling large data like this to save space and improve performance. However, there might be some restrictions in certain simulators or tools you might use.```verilog
module Problem8(input [3:0] a, b, output [3:0] diff);
  
  assign diff = a - b;

endmodule
```
This is the original code that subtracts the input arrays directly. It is the simplest and more straightforward way, but note that this might not match the expected result if you're doing bit-wise operations with packed arrays
