```
module tst_alu4();
  reg [3:0]a,b; reg[1:0] f; reg cci; logic[3:0]d; logic co;
  alu_4 aa(d,co,a,b,f,cci); // Instantiate ALU
  initial begin cci=1'b0; f=2'b00; a=4'h0; b=4'h0; #30 $stop; end // Initialize & stop
  always begin // Apply stimulus with #3 delay
  end
  initial $monitor($time, " cci = %b, a= %h,b = %h,f = %b,d =%h,co= %b ",cci,a,b,f,d,co); // Use %h
endmodule
```
The result of the output will be in bit format, not hexadecimal format. If you want the results in hexadecimal format, you can use `bin2hex` function in ModelSim.

In the modified code, we have changed `wire` to `logic` in the output ports. Please note that `wire` is used for output ports in Verilog, while `logic` is used for internal variables. 

The Verilog language specification allows you to use `logic` for all internal signals, but the simulation tools may not always support it. So, `logic` may not be the best option for all scenarios. It's up to the Verilog user to choose between these two types and what the simulation tools support.

The output type should be changed according to the simulator and the desired output format (binary or hexadecimal). In this sample, the output is in hexadecimal format which is more readable but it might not be supported by all simulators. So this is just for illustration. If you want binary format or hex for any variable, you should adjust the $monitor instruction accordingly.

This is a suggested modification which might not be applicable for all scenarios. The correct approach would depend on the simulator used and the specifics of the design.

This variation also includes a simple test bench that can be used to check the functionality of the alu. The test bench initializes the inputs to 0, then waits
