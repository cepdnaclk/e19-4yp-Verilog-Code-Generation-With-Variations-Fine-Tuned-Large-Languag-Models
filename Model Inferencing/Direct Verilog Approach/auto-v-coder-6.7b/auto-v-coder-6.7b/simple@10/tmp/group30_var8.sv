```verilog
module netdelay1(x,y);
input x;
output [31:0] y;  //Changed from 'output y;' to 'output [31:0] y;' to support 32 fields
wire nn; // Declare wire 'nn'
not (nn,x); // Assign NOT(x) to 'nn'
assign y={31'd0,nn}; // Assign 'nn' to 'y' as a unit width packed structure with 32 fields
endmodule
```
In this modified code, 'x' is received as an input, the NOT gate operation is performed on 'x' and the result is stored in 'nn', this is then packed to a 32-bit structure and assigned to 'y' as the output. This code will ensure proper verification for structural granularity. 

Remember to add required libraries (like $unitpls and $stellaris) to your testbench code if you are using these libraries in your project. This code also assumes that '$unitpls' and '$stellaris' are being used in your project and these libraries are available. 

Please test the code thoroughly to confirm its functionality.### Note: The code provided will not create a net delay due to the nature of combinational logic. It will simply perform a NOT gate operation and assign the result to 'y' directly. The delay simulation will be based on the delay value assigned in the code.

To generate a net delay in a Verilog testbench, simulations like $unitpls or $stellaris should be used, which are designed to simulate the propagation delay in electronic circuits. These simulations are not available for all platforms and their usage might require some additional setup or configuration. If you are not using any of these specific libraries, no modification is needed as per the code provided. If you are using these libraries in your project, then your testbench should also use these libraries for proper delay simulation.

The code provided is just a conceptual example. For actual code, adjust the design as per the specific requirements of your project.```verilog
module netdelay1(x,y);
input x;
output [31:0] y;
wire nn; // Declare wire 'nn'
