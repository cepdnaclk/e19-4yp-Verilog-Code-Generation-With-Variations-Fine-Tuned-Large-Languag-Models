```verilog
module FourFlopsStructL #(parameter DClk = 2, DBuf = 1)
(output[3:0] Q, input[3:0] D, input byte Ena, Clk);
wire[3:0] QWire;
localparam DTot = DBuf + DClk;
DFF DReg[3:0] (.Q(QWire),.D(D),.Clk(Clk));
assign #DTot Q = (Ena==1'b1)? QWire : 'bz;
endmodule
```
The above code is a variation of the original verilog code snippet. It changes the base type of the input vector from logic to byte. This will help to verify the compatibility of the module with byte-type input. The logic type is traditionally used for boolean logic whereas byte is used for storing 8-bit binary numbers. 

The 'D' input of the DFF module is of the byte type and the 'Ena' input is also of the byte type, both inputs are being used in the 'assign' statement. The output of the module is also of the byte type.

Please note that the byte data type in Verilog is not supported in all standard or commonly used Verilog simulators, so it would be best to test this in a simulator that supports byte data types. Also, please ensure that the 'assign' statement is syntactically correct in your compiler.

Overall, these changes don't reflect real-world application. They are meant to be used for testing different aspects of Verilog. If you intend to use a byte-type input, you would likely be better off using a byte-type input and output in your top-level module, rather than using the module in this way.

For the actual implementation, consider using 'logic' or the specific data type needed for boolean logic. This will ensure the highest compatibility with all Verilog simulators and that all your data types are properly represented in the design.

Remember to always test your code thoroughly and make sure that there are no other issues that could be causing the unexpected results. 

If there are still any issues after making these changes, it would be helpful to check if the issue persists after removing the byte data type and replacing it with the usual logic types
