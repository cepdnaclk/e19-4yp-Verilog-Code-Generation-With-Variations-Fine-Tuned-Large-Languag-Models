```verilog
module multiinput_IR ( input logic [1:0] data_in [0:3],
input logic [1:0] load,
input logic clk,
output reg [1:0] data_out [0:3] );

always @( posedge clk )
if ( load[0] ) data_out[0] <= data_in[0];
if ( load[1] ) data_out[1] <= data_in[1];
if ( load[2] ) data_out[2] <= data_in[2];
if ( load[3] ) data_out[3] <= data_in[3];
endmodule
```
This variation adds a multi-dimensional array as input and uses the inside operator to selectively load elements into the register according to the logic in `load`. The `data_in` array is 4-dimensional with each dimension being 2-bits wide. The `data_out` array also has 4 elements, each 2-bits wide. The `load` input array decides which element of `data_out` should be updated at each rising clock edge. Note that the `load` array should be 4-bits wide. This code can be extended to handle more complex cases. 

Please ensure to update the `data_out` array to match the size of your `data_in` array, and also ensure the correctness of your clock and load signal logic. The above code does not consider any other inputs or outputs and does not handle any possible error situations. This code serves as a starting point for building more complex multi-dimensional Verilog modules.

The above code will not compile if you have not synthesized it in a place where it expects to be used. It is recommended to test the code through simulation before real hardware implementation.

Also, always ensure Verilog code is written in a manner that it does not cause combinational loops, which could lead to unexpected results. It also does not handle any errors or edge cases. The code has been designed to serve as a starting point for more complex design. Hence, it's best to modify the design to suit your specific requirements. 

Finally, remember to always consider performance issues and timing constraints when designing complex Verilog circuits. It is always a good practice to follow best practices for digital
