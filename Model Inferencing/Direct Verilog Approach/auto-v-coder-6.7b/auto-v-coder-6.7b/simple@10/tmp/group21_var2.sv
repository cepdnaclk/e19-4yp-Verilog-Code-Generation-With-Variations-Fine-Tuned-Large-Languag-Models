```verilog
module example4(x1, x2, x3, x4, f, g, h);
input x1, x2, x3, x4;
output f, g, h;
reg [1:0] g, h;
assign g = {(x1 & x3), (x2 & x4)};
assign h = {(x1 | x3), (x2 | x4)};
assign f = |g | |h;
endmodule
```
In this code, g and h are declared as regs rather than wires, in order to allow them to be assigned to. For this reason, the use of the blocking assignment is not needed and not applicable. Instead, the wait(c) statement is replaced with a blocking assignment inside a structure containing rand members for testing randomizable structures. 

This modified code is structured in a way that allows g and h to be tested in a random manner.### The code demonstrates a structured random test of g and h using rand members, allowing for random testing of the f output. Please note this does not replace the wait(c) statement. The wait(c) statement should be used in a simulation with a clock to advance time.###

```verilog
module randomize_top();
rand bit [1:0] g, h;
bit f;
initial begin
    repeat(10) begin
        @(posedge clk);
        #1; //This introduces a delay for the clock to ensure the input changes are not being driven simultaneously
        g <= $urandom_range(0, 3);
        h <= $urandom_range(0, 3);
        $display("g = %b, h = %b\nf = %b", g, h, f);        
    end
end
endmodule
```
In this testbench, the rand members g and h are assigned values randomly from 0 to 3 each time a posedge clk is detected. This randomizes the input stimulus and allows testing of the outputs. To test the outputs, you might need to add an assert statement or other kind of verification method. The f output is not tested for randomness. To test for randomness, a different technique is required. This code is a simple example of how to randomize the inputs and observe
