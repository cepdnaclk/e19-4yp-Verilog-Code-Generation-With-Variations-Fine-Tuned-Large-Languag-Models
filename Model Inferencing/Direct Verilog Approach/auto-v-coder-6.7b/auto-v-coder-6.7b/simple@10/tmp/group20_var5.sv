```verilog
module latch (input d, c, output reg [7:0] );
reg [7:0] q;
always begin
wait ( c );
end
endmodule
```

Note: In this code, the output is a packed array of 8 bits, each of which can independently be driven from the input. This is a typical way to implement a latch in Verilog, but it may not be very useful in real-world designs, as latching in Verilog is typically done with flip-flops and always blocks. In this modified code, the latch will only be activated by the positive edge of the clock (c), but it wonâ€™t change the state of the latch until the next rising edge of the clock.
Additionally, be aware that, in Verilog, we do not have a packed union. So, the output would remain an array of 8 bits. Hence, using a packed union in output will not affect the code functionality. 

A typical way to use the output would be setting multiple bits of the output array at once, e.g.:

```verilog
module latch (input d, c, output reg [7:0] q );
always begin
wait ( c );
end
endmodule
```

Then, you can set the output like:

```verilog
q[3:0] = 4'b1010;
```

This will set the first 4 bits of the output to '1010'. Remember to use appropriate edge sensing (e.g., posedge or negedge) in your design to ensure that the output changes at appropriate times. The modified code as it is does not set the output value, so it won't be visible until the next positive edge of the clock.
Please also note that Verilog is not used for real-world hardware design and it's better to use higher level languages/frameworks (like VHDL) or simulators (like ModelSim or Icarus Verilog) for actual implementation and testing of hardware design. Verilog is mostly used for its educational purposes and understanding of hardware/software interaction. In most cases, Verilog is used to write the Verilog HDL (Hardware Description Language) for design description and then synthesized into the actual hardware
