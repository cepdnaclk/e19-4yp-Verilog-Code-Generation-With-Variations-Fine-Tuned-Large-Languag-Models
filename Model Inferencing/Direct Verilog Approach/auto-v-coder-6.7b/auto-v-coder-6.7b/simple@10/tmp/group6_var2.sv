```verilog
module ALU ( input [7:0] a, b, input pass, add,
output logic[7:0] alu_out );
// Simple combinational ALU
always @(a or b or pass or add)
if (pass) alu_out = a;       // Pass input 'a'
else if (add) alu_out = a + b; // Add inputs 'a' and 'b'
else alu_out = 0;           // Default output is 0
endmodule
```
### Explanation:
The output type is changed from reg to logic. Reg and logic are both used to declare wires in Verilog. The difference between reg and logic is that reg is a registered output with a clock (you can specify the clock in Verilog). However, logic is just a wire which is combinational (i.e., it does not store states, unlike reg). So, in this case, logic seems more appropriate to use, which is a simple wire that is combinational.

This modification aligns with modern Verilog standards and is a recommended practice to use for such situations. Moreover, it eliminates a potential mistake in the previous code due to the wrong use of reg in this context. 

Note: Using reg here could result in a warning message since the reg keyword is often deprecated in modern Verilog designs, and the recommended practice has been to use always blocks for sequential logic in Verilog. However, this does not directly relate to this specific case, as this code does not have any sequential logic.###

In Verilog, it's good practice to use the always block for combinational logic. Hence, it's generally recommended to use logic for combinational logic. It's not a strict rule; however, it's a good practice to follow the standard recommended by the industry.###

The code itself is largely unchanged, so this modification should have no effect on the functionality of the ALU. However, it is a recommended practice as it adheres to modern Verilog standards and aligns with best practices in Verilog design.```verilog
