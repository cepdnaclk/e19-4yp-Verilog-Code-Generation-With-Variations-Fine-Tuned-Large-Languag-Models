This code defines a module that has structure as input/output. To use this module, you would instantiate it with a Data_t variable as input, and assign the output to a variable of the same type. Note that the Data_t variable must be of the same structure.

Also note that this code requires a clock and reset signal to work correctly. Replace `rst` and `clk` with your actual reset and clock signals. The clock signal will determine the rate at which the output changes, and the reset signal will reset the output to 0. This code assumes that the clock signal (clk) and reset signal (rst) are present and that the clock signal is in the posedge triggering block.

This code can be further extended to include more fields in the Data_t structure, as needed.

Remember to replace `or_fr_rl` with your actual module name. Also, you need to define your clock and reset signals accordingly.

The `$stop` command is used to stop execution of the simulation after a certain time. However, this command is not a part of Verilog. Verilog does not have a native mechanism to stop the
