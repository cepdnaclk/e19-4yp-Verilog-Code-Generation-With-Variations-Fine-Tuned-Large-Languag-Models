```Verilog
module XOR_Gate(
    input logic [1:0] A [0:3],
    input logic [1:0] B [0:3],
    output logic [1:0] Y [0:3]
);
    integer i;
    always @(*) begin
        for(i=0; i<4; i=i+1) begin
            Y[i] = A[i] ^ B[i];
        end
    end
endmodule
```
In the modified code, the inputs A and B are packed 1D logic-vector arrays (2-bit elements) with a range of 0 to 3. This means that the module XOR_Gate will process 4 2-bit vectors, hence it represents a 4-dimensional XOR operation.

The outputs Y are also packed 1D logic-vector arrays, with a range also of 0 to 3.

Inside the module, a for loop is used to perform an XOR operation on each pair of corresponding elements from the input arrays A and B. The results are stored in the output array Y.

Note: The XOR operation is considered element-wise for the input arrays, not for the vectors as a whole. For example, A[0] XOR B[0], A[1] XOR B[1], and so on.

To test this module, you can create a testbench in Verilog and connect it to the module. This testbench should provide stimulus for the inputs of the module by assigning values to them and then observing the outputs to verify the correctness of the XOR operation.

For example, you can initialize the inputs to A as `{2'b10, 2'b01, 2'b11, 2'b00}` and initialize the inputs to B as `{2'b01, 2'b10, 2'b11, 2'b00}`, and observe the outputs to verify the XOR operation of `{2'b10, 2'b11, 2'b00, 2'b00}` as expected.

This code is a simple way to test the XOR_Gate module in Verilog
