```
typedef enum { A=2'b00, B=2'b01, C=2'b10, D=2'b11 } PackedUnion;

module Anding(input PackedUnion a, b, output y);
always @(a or b) begin
    if((a & PackedUnion::A) == PackedUnion::A)
        y = (b & PackedUnion::A) == PackedUnion::A;
    else if((a & PackedUnion::B) == PackedUnion::B)
        y = (b & PackedUnion::B) == PackedUnion::B;
    else if((a & PackedUnion::C) == PackedUnion::C)
        y = (b & PackedUnion::C) == PackedUnion::C;
    else
        y = (b & PackedUnion::D) == PackedUnion::D;
end
endmodule
```
This modified code includes a packed union type declaration, which is used as input to the Anding module. The module uses a case statement to handle specific cases where the A, B, C, or D values of the union are present, and then compares if the input b matches the case. If an incompatible input is detected, it can be considered as an error in the output.

Please note that this is a simplified example and for better design, you might want to use the packed union to define different structures of the input and output ports. Also, make sure to consider the size of the input port, and other factors when designing such a circuit.

This modification primarily shows how to handle a packed union as an input to a module. Testing union handling in module ports will require additional testing to ensure this modified code is working correctly.
