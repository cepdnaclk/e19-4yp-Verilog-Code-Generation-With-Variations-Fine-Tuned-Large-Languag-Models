```Verilog
module par(in, parity, all_ones);
// Define the structure
typedef struct packed {
  logic x1;
  logic x2;
  logic x3;
  logic x4;
} input_packed;

// Inputs
input_packed in;
output parity, all_ones;

// Bitwise operations on the structure
// Parity operation
assign parity = ^in;

// All One Operation
assign all_ones = &in;
endmodule
```
In this code, we first define a structure called `input_packed` that packs 4 logic fields (x1, x2, x3, x4). We then use this structure as the input to the module. The bitwise operations we apply are:

- `^in`: Bitwise XOR operator, returns 1 if exactly one of the input bits is 1, otherwise 0. It is used here to find the parity of four input bits.
- `&in`: Bitwise AND operator, returns 1 if all the input bits are 1, otherwise 0. It is used here to find if all four input bits are 1 (representing all ones).

Note: The `logic` type in Verilog is a built-in data type representing digital logic. 

In the above code, `^` is used to find the parity of the four bits. `^` is a bitwise operator which returns a bit if the number of 1s is odd in the operation. `&` is used to find if all the bits are 1. `&` is a bitwise operator which returns 1 if all the bits are 1. Note that this is a packed struct, so the entire struct is considered as a single bit for these operations.

This example provides a way to test the bitwise operations on structure-based logic operations. It could prove useful when dealing with packed structs for specific operations or when working with bitwise operations. In this case, you may use the struct as a single entity for your operations. As such, each operation is applied to the struct, not individual bits.```Verilog
module par(in, parity, all_ones);
// Define the structure
typedef struct packed {
  logic x1;
