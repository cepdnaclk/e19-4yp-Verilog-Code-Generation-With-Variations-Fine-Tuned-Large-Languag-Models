```verilog
module example4(x1, x2, x3, x4, f, g, h);
input x1, x2, x3, x4;
output f, g, h;

rand bit randombit;

bit g, h, f;

always @(posedge clk) begin
  if (rst) begin
    g <= '0;
    h <= '0;
    f <= '0;
  end
  else begin
    g <= (x1 & x3) | (x2 & x4);
    h <= (x1 | x3) & (x2 | x4);
    f <= g | h;
  end
end
endmodule
```
In this modified code, an example4 test bench is created to test the design of example4. The test bench has a clock and a reset signal. When the reset signal is asserted, the g, h, and f variables are set to 0. Otherwise, the values of g, h, and f are updated based on the current values of x1, x2, x3, and x4 according to the design rules.

This code can be tested using $random, $urandom, or $urandom_range functions depending on the purpose of the randomness.

Remember, the actual timing of the assignment in this code is not defined by Verilog, but it would be assigned in a way that makes sense in the context of the module's inputs and outputs. In this context, the assignments are done immediately, which is not the case in many hardware designs.

Note: This code assumes you are using a clock and reset signal in your design. You may want to adjust the timing or reset conditions according to your specific requirements.

Also remember, in the above code, only one of the '0' or '1' is assigned because the '0' and '1' are equivalent in Verilog. That's why they're used interchangeably in this example. However, '0' and '1' represent binary numbers in Verilog. The assignment of '0' or '1' doesn't necessarily represent a binary value ('0' is equivalent to 0 and '1' is equivalent to 1). Verilog considers '0' and '1' as their binary representations. As
