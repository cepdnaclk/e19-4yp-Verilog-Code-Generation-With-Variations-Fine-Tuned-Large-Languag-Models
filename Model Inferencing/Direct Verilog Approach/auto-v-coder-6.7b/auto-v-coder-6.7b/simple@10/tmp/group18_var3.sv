```verilog
// Enum declaration
typedef enum logic [1:0] {A = 2'b01, B = 2'b10} input_enum;

// Module declaration
module show_aa(ao,ai); // NOT gate with delay 2
  output ao; input input_enum ai; // Declare enum-based input
  wire ao;
  assign ao = ~ai; // NOT gate
endmodule
```
You can declare and initialize variables of enum type in Verilog. The following example illustrates how to use enum:

```verilog
initial begin
  input_enum ai; // Declare enum-based variable
  ai = A;
  // ai = B;

  show_aa show_aa_inst(ao,ai); // Instantiate the module
  $display("Output of NOT gate: %b", ao);
end
```
You can replace `ai = A;` with `ai = B;` to test different inputs.### This code creates an enum for input, using a logic type with size 1 bit and range 0 to 1. It also uses the default value of each enum member because they're declared without a specific value.

You can also modify the enum to include non-default values if needed. For example:

```verilog
typedef enum logic [1:0] {A = 2'b01, B = 2'b10} {A = 2'b01, B = 2'b10} input_enum;
```

This would make `A = 2'b01` and `B = 2'b10`, but the default will still be 2'b00 (which is also called 'uninitialized') and can be used when no specific value is required.

Please note that you need to include your module in a testbench file to run the test case. 

Also, use `logic` instead of `wire` to declare the output. Verilog will implicitly declare the ports of a module as `wire` if they are not declared. `logic` is more explicit.

This variation is an example of how to work with enum in Verilog. As it is, it can be further expanded to test different signals through enum
