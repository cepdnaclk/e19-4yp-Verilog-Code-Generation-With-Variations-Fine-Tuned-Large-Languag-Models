```verilog
module DataComponent (DataIn, DataOut, ControlSignals);

typedef struct packed {
  bit [7:0] Data;
  bit Valid;
} Data_t;

input DataIn;
output DataOut;
input ControlSignals;

reg [7:0] data_out_reg;
always @(posedge ControlSignals or negedge ControlSignals) begin
  if (ControlSignals == 1) begin
    data_out_reg <= DataIn;
  end
end

assign DataOut = data_out_reg;

endmodule
```

In this variation, we have removed the data construct and replaced it with a struct which contains a rand member. We also added an always block to create a clocked process that updates `data_out_reg` on every positive edge of `ControlSignals`. The `assign` statement is used to update the `DataOut` signal whenever `ControlSignals` is asserted. This ensures that the `DataOut` always follows the `DataIn` input when `ControlSignals` is asserted.

Remember to use the `Data_t` structure instead of the `DataIn` and `DataOut` signals directly. For example:
```verilog
Data_t data_struct;

always @(posedge ControlSignals or negedge ControlSignals) begin
  if (ControlSignals == 1) begin
    data_struct.Data <= DataIn;
    data_struct.Valid <= 1;
  end
end

assign DataOut = data_struct.Data;
```

This modifies the verilog code to support randomization via the struct as follows:
```verilog
Data_t data_struct;

always @(posedge ControlSignals or negedge ControlSignals) begin
  if (ControlSignals == 1) begin
    data_struct.Data <= $random;
    data_struct.Valid <= 1;
  end
end

assign DataOut = data_struct.Data;
```

This uses the $random function which returns a random value in the range 0 to 2^32-1 for the data part of the struct and sets the valid flag to 1. ### Note: The use of `
