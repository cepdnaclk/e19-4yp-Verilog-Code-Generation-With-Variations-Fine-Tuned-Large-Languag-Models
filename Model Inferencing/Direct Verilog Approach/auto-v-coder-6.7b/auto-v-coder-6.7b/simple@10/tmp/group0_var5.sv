```verilog
// Create a module with one input and one output that behaves like a wire
module wire_assign( input bit in, output out );
    // assign out to in
    assign out = in;
endmodule
```
The modified code uses a SystemVerilog bit type for the input 'in'. This code will behave the same as the original code but it also tests the usage of SystemVerilog bit type.### Note:
In SystemVerilog, `bit` is used to declare a variable which can only store 0 or 1 value. It replaces Verilog's `wire` type. This is useful for hardware design because it ensures each bit only goes either high (Z) or low (X).

Bit type variables in Verilog can be assigned to a `bit` type variable with the same size. If a `bit` is assigned to a `wire` or `reg` of different size, the value is truncated to the size of the target. This is known as bus assignment or bit select assignment.

This code will behave as a wire assignment but it demonstrates the use of the bit type in SystemVerilog.```verilog
// Create a module with one input and one output that behaves like a wire
module wire_assign( input bit in, output out );
    // assign out to in
    assign out = in;
endmodule

This section of the code demonstrates the operation of assigning bits from one variable to another. It uses the `assign` statement to connect the input `in` to the output `out`
