In this modified code, we have replaced the values of A and B from a single hexadecimal number to a 4-bit logic vector. The change allows us to test 4-bit combinational logic behavior. The delay has been modified to stop the testbench execution so that it runs for a finite duration. The `$monitor` statement is used to display the current status of the design on each clock cycle. 

Remember to replace the `alu_1 aa(d,co,a,b,f,cci);` with the actual module name if you're using a different ALU module.

Also, note that the ALU module or logic inside your `alu_1` module would need to be capable of handling 4-bit operands and produce a valid 4-bit output and carry out a valid operation based on the control signals. The `a`, `b`, `f`, and `cci` signals are connected to the `alu_1` module, so they must be capable of representing and translating these signals into an operation that the `alu_1` module can perform.###

This testbench is designed to execute the ALU module with a variety of control signals (`f`) and oper
