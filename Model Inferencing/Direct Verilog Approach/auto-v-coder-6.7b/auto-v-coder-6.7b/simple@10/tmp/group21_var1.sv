module example4(x1, x2, x3, x4, f, g, h);
import rand_pkg::*;
input x1, x2, x3, x4;

In this modified code, we have added a class rand_cls with rand variables x1, x2, x3, and x4. The pre_randomize method is used to set default values before the randomization of variables. The class has a constraint x_constraint which restricts the values of x1, x2, x3, and x4 to be within the range 0 to 14. This constraint ensures that the simulation can reach an acceptable point quickly. It is also necessary to import the package rand_pkg in the testbench to use the randomizable class.

Note: Due to the nature of randomizable structures, changes to the input values can result in a different output value. It is important to ensure that the constraints are set up properly to avoid erroneous results. This is just an example and may not work as expected in all situations.### Base Verilog Code:
