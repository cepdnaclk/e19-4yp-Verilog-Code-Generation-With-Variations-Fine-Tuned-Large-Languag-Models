```verilog
module Problem1(input logic [3:0] a, b, output logic [3:0] sum);
  assign sum = a + b;
endmodule
```
This code will function correctly in both SystemVerilog and Verilog. However, Verilog's reg type is deprecated, and SystemVerilog's logic type is strongly recommended for compatibility. So, the modified code uses logic to keep it compatible with both standards. The input and output types are specified as logic, which matches the recommended practice for SystemVerilog as well. This code is designed to add two 4-bit inputs and deliver the result as a 4-bit output. 

Note: The code is written assuming Verilog-2001 syntax. For Verilog-1995, the input and output declarations should be given as "reg". In Verilog-AMS, the input and output declarations should be given as "wire". In Verilog-AMS, for compatibility with Verilog-1995, we can use "reg" in the declarations. However, the recommendation is to use logic for compatibility with both Verilog-1995 and SystemVerilog.

In summary, the code is written in a way to ensure compatibility with both Verilog-2001 and SystemVerilog. It uses the recommended practice for both standards in terms of input/output types. However, in terms of actual implementation, Verilog-1995 and Verilog-AMS should behave similarly to Verilog-2001. In case of Verilog-1995, we should use "reg" instead of "wire" for inputs and outputs. In case of Verilog-AMS, we can use "reg" for inputs and outputs.

This is just a suggestion, and there may be other ways to write this code based on the specific requirements. It is always recommended to use logic for compatibility with both Verilog-2001 and SystemVerilog. In case of large designs or future compatibility, consider using the SystemVerilog structure and type recommendations. In general, the choice between SystemVerilog and Verilog is limited when we use only Verilog-2001. However, when it comes to future compatibility or using
