In this modified code, 4-bit logic vectors A and B are used as input to test the multi-bit combinational logic behavior of different operations. The operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The carry/borrow inverter condition (cci) is also updated for testing.
Please note that the ALU module needs to be written for this to work and you need to have a verilog simulator installed to run the code. 

This code applies stimulus to the ALU and outputs the result after every operation. In this simulation, we are not considering the carry/borrow generation and propagation in the ALU operation.

Remember to replace "alu_1" with your actual ALU module name and to adjust the timing to match your system and the timing requirements of your ALU operations. The delay
