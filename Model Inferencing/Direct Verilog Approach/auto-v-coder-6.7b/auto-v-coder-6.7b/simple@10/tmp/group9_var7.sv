```verilog
module Problem8(input [3:0] a, b, output [3:0] diff);
  // Structure declaration
  typedef struct packed {
    logic [1:0] x;
    logic [1:0] y;
    logic [1:0] z;
  } packedStruct;
  
  // Instantiate packedStruct
  packedStruct myStruct;
  
  // Assign values to packed structure members
  assign myStruct.x = 2'b11;
  assign myStruct.y = 2'b01;
  assign myStruct.z = 2'b10;
  
  // Assign packed structure diff variable
  assign diff = myStruct.x - myStruct.y;
endmodule
```
In this code, we first declare a structure called `packedStruct` using the `typedef struct packed` declaration. This structure includes three logic types in fields `x`, `y`, and `z`. After that, we instantiate the `myStruct` of type `packedStruct`. Then we assign values to the fields of `myStruct`.
Finally, the `diff` output is assigned to the result of subtracting the `x` and `y` fields of `myStruct`.
Please note that the packed structure variable assignment and the diff assignment are inside the same module. This should be fine for synthesis as long as the tools support packed structures. However, keep in mind that the differences in bit-fields and bit-orders between the bit-vector and the packed structure may cause a different result. This may need more elaboration based on the exact tools and constraints.

Remember that packed structure is mainly used for better memory utilization and should be used in case you need to create a packed data (wire, register, etc.) in a Verilog design. When used in an array or structure with packed modifier, it helps reduce the space usage compared to a bit-vector. However, it might result in a longer wire/signal assignment in the netlist, which should be taken into account while designing.

Also, note that Verilog does not support bit-wise operations on packed structures. In this code, we use subtraction instead of bitwise operations, which might not be valid bit-wise operations.###
