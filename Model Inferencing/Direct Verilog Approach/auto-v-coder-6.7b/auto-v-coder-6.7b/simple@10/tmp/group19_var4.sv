```verilog
module dff_testbench();
reg[1:0] D;
reg Clock, Resetn;
wire Q;
dff_inst flipflop(.D(D[1]),.Clock(Clock),.Resetn(Resetn),.Q(Q));
initial begin
Clock = 0;
forever #5 Clock = ~Clock;
end
initial begin
Resetn = 1'b0;
#25 Resetn = 1'b1;
#10 D = 2'b00;
#10 D = 2'b01;
#10 D = 2'b10;
#10 D = 2'b11;

$stop;
end
endmodule
```
In this modified code, the array D is declared as a 2-bit wide register. This can accommodate two different input cases: 00 and 11. A variable called Clock is declared to be a flip-flop. The flipflop is instantiated in the dff_inst module. The Clock is toggled in the initial block, while Resetn is driven low at time 25ns and then high at time 10ns. D is driven to 00 at time 10ns, 01 at 20ns, 10 at 30ns, and 11 at 40ns. After the 40ns, the simulation is stopped. This allows the verification of the dff_inst behavior with both inputs: 00 and 11.
Please note that this example requires the use of the LPM (Lattice Programming Method) library to compile. The instantiation of the flip-flop in dff_inst requires an array access for D, as array elements are not directly accessible from the entity. A lpm_ff entity can have only one input. To address this problem, we need to instantiate a sequence of flip-flops, each with a different input. This is beyond the scope of this question and the available tools. This is also a common issue when dealing with array input in Verilog.

Be sure to add the library in your.v file before trying to compile, i.e., `lpm_components.lpm_ff`
