```verilog
//Define a Union type.
typedef union packed {
  logic [0:7] a;
  logic [0:7] b;
} t_union;

module Anding (input t_union in, output logic y);
always @(*) begin
  //The output is high if both the inputs are high, otherwise it is low.
  y = (in.a && in.b);
end
endmodule
```
This variation will allow you to test passing a single 8 bit bus that can represent either an 8-bit 'a' signal or an 8-bit 'b' signal. The module will internally use a 8-bit bus of the same name. This method demonstrates how to handle multiple input signals within a module in Verilog.

Please note that you do need to ensure that the logic within the module is structured in such a way that it reads the correct input based on the union definition. If the module is supposed to use 'a' or 'b' depending on the input, you will need to modify the logic accordingly within the module. This is a simplified example to understand how union can be used in module instantiation. In a real-world application, you should use more complex logic to handle such signals.
