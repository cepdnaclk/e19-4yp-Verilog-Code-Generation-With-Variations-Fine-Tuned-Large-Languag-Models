```
module sw2led2 #(parameter N = 8) (
    input wire [N-1:0] sw,
    output reg [N-1:0] ld
);

assign ld = sw;

initial begin
    // Test Case 1: Positive Numbers
    #100;
    sw = 8'b00001111;
    #100;
    
    // Test Case 2: Negative Numbers
    #100;
    sw = 8'b11110000;
    #100;
end
endmodule
```
In the above code, an additional test case with negative numbers is added. The `#100` delay is used to allow the signals to settle before triggering the change.

Remember to compile the module with the same number of bits for the test case and the module. If you use 8 bits for both the module and test case, they will work correctly. If you use a different number of bits, you will not be able to compare the results correctly.

To simulate this verilog module with an additional test case, you can use the following commands:

```
iverilog sw2led2_testbench.v
vvp a.out
```

Here, `iverilog` is used to compile the verilog files and `vvp` is used to run the compiled files.

Remember to replace the `8'b00001111` and `8'b11110000` with the appropriate data for your case.

This will simulate your module with an additional test case for handling negative numbers. 

Please ensure to replace the specific signals and delays according to your needs.

Please note: This is a simple example. In a real-world scenario, Verilog requires additional features for signed numbers. Also, in case of simulation, it is important to verify the test cases with the desired test bench. As the simulation is a part of synthesis, your logic might need a little change for synthesis. 

Always keep in mind to write synthesizable code or perform a design analysis before synthesizing. Always use the simulation results to debug your design or find any unnecessary gates in your design.
