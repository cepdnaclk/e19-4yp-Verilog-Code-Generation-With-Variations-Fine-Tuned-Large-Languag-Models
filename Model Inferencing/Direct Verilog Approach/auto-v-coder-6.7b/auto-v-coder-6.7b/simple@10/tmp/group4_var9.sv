```verilog
module testbench ();
struct { 
rand bit [2:0] data;
} data;
initial begin
repeat (10) begin 
$display("data = %h", data.data);
$finish;
end
endmodule
```
This modified code creates a struct with a rand member `data` which is a 3-bit wide binary number. It then generates 10 random values of `data` and displays them. The `$finish;` statement is used to end the simulation, which is often used in testbenches to prevent the testbench from running indefinitely. This code may not synthesize but is a simple but illustrative example of using random data inside a structure.

Note: Ensure the randomization method is set correctly for the randomization of the `data` member. In this case, the default method (`'get_rand_mode()`) is used, which might not create unique values in some cases. For example, if you set the `get_rand_mode()` to `'dist_onehot`, then the `data` member will be a one-hot encoded random value. Please set the correct randomization method based on your requirements. 

If you want to use `'dist_uniform`, you may need to set the minimum and maximum values for the `data` member. 

If the `data` member is declared as a signed or unsigned type, you may need to adjust the range of the randomization.

This code will be synthesisable, but it is not designed to synthesize since it only uses built-in Verilog features like data structures and randomization, which are not typically supported by synthesis tools. It is designed to demonstrate the use of randomization within a structure in Verilog. If you want to synthesize this code, you will need to use an appropriate synthesis tool (such as Synopsys synthesis) or a synthesis-aware tool.

You can run this code on a simulator environment to execute the testbench and see the display of random values.

Remember to change the initial settings like `$timeformat`, `$monitor`, etc., based on your specific simulation tool and simulation environment. This example uses `$display`, which is part of the Verilog standard library for display messages in the
