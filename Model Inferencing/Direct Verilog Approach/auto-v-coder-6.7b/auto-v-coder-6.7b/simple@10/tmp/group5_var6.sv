```verilog
module tst_dff_pbeh();
  logic di,clk; logic do;
  dff_p d1(do,di,clk); // Instantiate DFF with path delay
  initial begin clk=0; di=1'b0; #35 $stop; end // Initialize & stop
  always #3 clk=~clk; // Generate clock (negedges at 6, 12, 18...)
  always #5 di=~di; // Toggle data
  initial $monitor($time,"clk=%b, di=%b, do=%b",clk,di,do);
endmodule
```
In SystemVerilog, the logic keyword is used for declaring the signal types. In Verilog, the reg keyword is used, however, in SystemVerilog, logic supports both reg and wire types. This means you can use logic when you want to ensure it is a wire. In this modified code, logic is used for declaring di and clk, which are inputs to the DFF. The data output (do) is also assigned the logic type to ensure it's a wire. This is recommended for compatibility with SystemVerilog syntax.

Please note that the use of logic is a feature of SystemVerilog. If you want to continue using Verilog, you can use wire instead of logic for inputs and outputs, as Verilog doesn't support logic type. In general, using logic for all signals is the recommended practice in SystemVerilog for compatibility reasons.
