This modified code will take two 32-bit inputs, convert them to signed [3:0] with the help of the `signed'` keyword, perform an addition operation, and store the result in the 32-bit `Result`. The `temp` 64-bit register is used to hold the intermediate value, allowing for the possibility of negative signed values. The `Result` will not exceed the 32-bit range. The rest of the code is unchanged.

Remember to include the following verilog define flag in your compiler command line: `-DSYNTHESIS`. This will enable the synthesis phase to understand and propagate the timing specifications.

These modifications should be considered based on the specific use case. Note that using `signed'` can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior, especially with large numbers or when working with a mix of signed and unsigned numbers. In complex designs, careful thought should be given to the implications of working with signed numbers. This example serves more as a simple demonstration of verilog signal handling and doesn't take into account the actual use case. Be sure to check your verilog code for proper behavior and follow good coding practices.

Disclaimer: These modifications are based on the assumption that we just need to test the signed arithmetic operations. Please beware that the actual use case could be different, and this code should be adjusted accordingly.


The synthesis tool should generate the appropriate timing constraints for the logic clock and the ALU operation. Please replace tRise, tFall and the rest of the code (other than the modifications) with the appropriate synthesis directives. Check the synthesis tool documentation for more details.
