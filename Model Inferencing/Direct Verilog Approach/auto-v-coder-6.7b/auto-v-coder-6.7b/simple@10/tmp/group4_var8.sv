```verilog
module testbench ();
  struct {
    rand bit[3:0] data;
  } test_struct;
  
  initial begin
    test_struct.data = 4'b1111;
    repeat (1) begin
      test_struct.data = $urandom_range(15, 0);
      $display("Data: %4b", test_struct.data);
    end
  end
endmodule
```
In this modified code, we have a struct named test_struct that has a rand member called data. We initialize the data member to a constant value (4'b1111) and then use a loop to iterate 1 times, each time replacing the data member with a random value from the range of 15 to 0. The $display macro is used to print the value of data after each iteration.

This testbench will print 16 random values from the range of 0 to 15 every time it is run.!
