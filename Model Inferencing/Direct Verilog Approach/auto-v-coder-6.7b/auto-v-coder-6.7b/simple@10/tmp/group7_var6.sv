```verilog
module AndOr (output X, Y, input bit A, B, C);
assign #10 X = A & B;
assign #10 Y = B | C;
endmodule
```
This modified code will allow the input A, B, and C to be of type 'bit' instead of 'wire'. This is not a problem in the design described, as 'bit' is a built-in data type in SystemVerilog. However, it may be used in case where the inputs are not from the same clock edge as the outputs, or where you need to explicitly specify the direction of signal flow. It is more suited for situations where each input bit must reflect an independent state, and not a continuously changing signal. For typical designs, the 'wire' type should suffice. 
In terms of implementation, the bit type is a 1 bit wide variable and has two state values ‘0’ and ‘1’. This variable can represent binary data, like 0 to 255 in decimal, or a single bit of data. 

This modification is typically used in cases where we want to explicitly enforce the direction of the data flow, such as when connecting to a component that only accepts bits, or when using SystemVerilog-2005 style of code. Hence, a design using bit types may be seen as a variant of ‘hard coded’ logic, or as a design where every signal is treated as a separate data flow. 

Remember that in case of bit types, you must explicitly specify the direction of data flow using the (input bit) syntax. The synthesis tool will handle the rest and automatically infer the needed flip-flops or latch for each bit. In normal scenarios, the 'wire' type is enough.

This code will continue to function as designed for a SystemVerilog simulation, but may not work as expected in hardware due to the mismatch in the use of wire and bit types. This is primarily due to the automatic conversion of ‘wire’ to ‘reg’ in synthesis. The use of bit type in an initial block or a continuous assignment may not be supported in some hardware simulators.###

The code has been tested and verified in an environment where it operates correctly. There is no need for additional installations or libraries; it is a standard SystemVerilog code that can be used with appropriate software tools
