```verilog
module wire_assign( input bit in, output out );
    // assign out to in
    assign out = in;
endmodule
```
In SystemVerilog, a bit is the smallest unit of data that can be assigned, declared, or manipulated. It can only hold two values: 0 or 1. This changes the type of the input variable from wire to bit, which is a built-in data type in SystemVerilog. This code should compile without any errors.

Please note that the bit data type was introduced in IEEE 1800-2017 (SystemVerilog IEEE 1800-2017 standard) and it is not fully supported by all simulation tools. If you encounter any issues with this code, please ensure that your simulation tool supports bit data types.

Also, keep in mind that bit data type is different from Verilog 2001's always_comb and always_ff blocks, which were designed for use with flip-flops and combinational logic respectively. In SystemVerilog, bit data type allows you to control the value of the bit directly within combinational logic (logic block). The always_comb and always_ff blocks are now largely replaced by flops, register blocks, and logic blocks in SystemVerilog.

For a full understanding, you may want to read more about bit data type in SystemVerilog from the IEEE 1800-2017 Standard.

Also, remember that bit-type variables should only be used for control signals (i.e., signals that only hold 0 or 1), not for data signals. Data signals should be declared by using the appropriate data type depending on the use case. For example, for unsigned numbers, one should use integer or reg, for signed numbers one should use int, and for real numbers one should use real. This is important because the bit data type does not support arithmetic operations, comparisons, or concatenations. These are operations that would be required for a wide variety of tasks when using bit data type in SystemVerilog. In most cases, the appropriate data type should be used for data signals.

In SystemVerilog, the bit data type is particularly useful for controlling combinational logic, where you need to control the value of a wire directly,
