```verilog
module test;
wire a;
reg [0:2] signals;
assign #25 signals[0] = 1;
always begin
    #10 signals[1:2] = signals[0:1];
end
endmodule
```
In the above code, `signals[0]` represents the `a` wire, `signals[1]` represents the `x` register, and `signals[2]` represents the `y` and `z` registers.

The first assignment `#25 signals[0] = 1` sets `a` high for 25 time units. The second assignment `#10 signals[1:2] = signals[0:1]` sets `x` and `y` registers to the value of `a` and `y`. 

This version of the code should be run in a simulator to test the behavior. In this case, `x` and `y` will remain at `a`'s value, whereas `z` will be `0`. If you want to test `z` in a similar way, you can assign `signals[2]` during a certain period of time.### Note:
This code is just for a simple demonstration of how to use packed structures for multiple signals. In a real-world situation, the hardware design would be more complex and it would be more appropriate to control signals separately, rather than combined into a packed structure for a single clock cycle. Variation Instructions

If you need to use packed structures for a complex design, you might consider using structs instead of packed arrays. Structs provide more flexibility and support for individual signal control, but they are slightly more complex to use. For instance, you could define a structure:

```verilog
typedef struct packed {
    logic a;
    logic x;
    logic y;
    logic z;
} signals;
```

And then use it as follows:

```verilog
module test;
signals signals;
assign #25 signals.a = 1;
always begin
    #10 signals.x = signals.a;
    signals.y = signals.a;
    signals.z = 0;
end
endmodule
```

This version of the code is more complex and does not require the
