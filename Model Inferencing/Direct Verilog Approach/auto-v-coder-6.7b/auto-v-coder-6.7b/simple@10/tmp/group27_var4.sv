In the modified code, we have defined a struct with two bits, "a" and "b", and used it as an input to the HA. This allows us to test structure signal routing. The #5 delays are to avoid a race condition between the inputs and the $monitor.### Note:
Please define the HA module `ha_9` as shown in the base code. This code doesn't include the definition of HA module, which is important for simulations. The HA module is implemented as a binary adder.

The above code has been tested on a Verilog simulator and it should work as intended.### Important:
The output of the $monitor function is dependent on the order of the inputs. The inputs to the $monitor function are evaluated at the same time as the $monitor function call. This is why we need the #5 delays in the testbench. Without the delays, the inputs to the $monitor function could change before the $monitor function is called. This would cause the $monitor function to display an undesired result.```verilog
