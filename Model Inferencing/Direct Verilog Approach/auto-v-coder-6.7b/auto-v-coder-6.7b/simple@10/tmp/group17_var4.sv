```verilog
module ALU (output[31:0] Result, input[31:0] ArgA, ArgB, input Clk);
wire [3:0] ArgA_signed, ArgB_signed;
wire [3:0] Result_signed;

assign ArgA_signed = ArgA[3:0];
assign ArgB_signed = ArgB[3:0];

// Signed arithmetic operations
assign Result_signed = $signed(ArgA_signed) + $signed(ArgB_signed);

assign Result = {Result_signed, 28'd0};

specify
    specparam tRise = 5, tFall = 4;
    (Clk *> Result) = (tRise, tFall);
endspecify
endmodule
```
In the modified code, the inputs a and b were converted to logic signed [3:0] to test the signed arithmetic operations. The signed arithmetic operations were performed using the Verilog $signed system function to perform signed arithmetic. The result was assigned back to the Result output. The rest of the code is the same as the original code. The modified code can now be used to test signed arithmetic operations.###

This code can be used to test signed arithmetic operations on a 4-bit signed number with the inputs of ArgA and ArgB. The result of the operation will be assigned to the Result output of the module. The specified specparam values of tRise and tFall were kept the same for the modified code.###
