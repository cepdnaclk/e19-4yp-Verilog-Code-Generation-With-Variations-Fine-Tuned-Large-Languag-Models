In this modified code, we have added a structure "PackedStruct" which contains packed bitstreams for testing struct signal routing. This is a simulation example and does not reflect the actual hardware implementation. #5 delays are used to generate periodic signals which are propagated to the inputs of the HA module. The inputs are routed through the "assign" statements to provide the inputs to the HA module, which is tested. #30 delays are added to allow the simulation to terminate. 

Remember, the actual hardware implementation may differ based on the specific requirements of the design. Also, in hardware, the packed struct signal routing might not be the best method, as it is difficult to control the path delays and timing related issues like data integrity, alignment, or synchronization issues. It is generally preferred to use separate wires or I/O ports for packed struct signals.

Please note that you should replace ha_9 with your actual HA module name. This implementation is based on the assumption that ha_9 is
