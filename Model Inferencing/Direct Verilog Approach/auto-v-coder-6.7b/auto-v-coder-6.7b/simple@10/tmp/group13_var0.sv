// Verilog code for Problem 5
module Half_Adder(
    input A, B,
    output logic [7:0] Sum, Carry
);
    assign Sum = A ^ B;
    assign Carry = A & B;
endmodule

This modification is to align with the Verilog standard more recently adopted by the industry where the output type is defined as logic [7:0] instead of reg. It might not be necessary to use always_comb for combinational logic since it's a relatively simple module, but it's recommended for larger designs.### Instructions:

1. Save the modified Verilog file with a name like "Half_Adder_Modified.v".
2. Upload the modified Verilog file to your design software or environment.
3. Review the code to ensure it behaves as expected.
4. Make any necessary adjustments or changes to the code based on the specific requirements of your project.
5. Recompile or rerun the code to ensure it works as intended.

The updated code should be now ready to integrate into your design system.###

Note: The "always_comb" statement is used to indicate that the block of code should be executed whenever any of the input variables change. It's not necessary for a simple half-adder module, but is useful in larger designs for readability and correctness. However, be aware that it may not be strictly necessary as the assignment statements are pure combinational logic and are implicitly handled by the synthesis tool. In practice, it's a best practice to use "always_comb" for such cases.
