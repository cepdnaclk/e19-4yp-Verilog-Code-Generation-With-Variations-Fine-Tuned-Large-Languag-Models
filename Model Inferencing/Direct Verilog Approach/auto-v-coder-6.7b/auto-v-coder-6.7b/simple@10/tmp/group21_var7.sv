```verilog
module example4(x1, x2, x3, x4, f, g, h);
input x1, x2, x3, x4;
output f, g, h;

rand bit [1:0] r; 
bit [1:0] a;

always @(*)
    a = r;

assign g = (x1 & x3) | (x2 & x4);
assign h = (x1 | x3) & (x2 | x4);
assign f = g | h;
endmodule
```
In this modified code, `rand bit [1:0] r;` is added as a rand member of the module. This rand member can now be constrained inside a testbench or top module to be used for testing. Also, the blocking assignment `always @(*) a = r;` is used to bind the rand member `r` to an internal signal `a`. This ensures changes to the rand member `r` are immediately visible to the `a` signal in the design.
The `rand` keyword is used to declare a randomizable variable in the Verilog language. It allows for the generation of random values during simulation for verification purposes. When a module contains random variables, the simulator will automatically generate random values at simulation time.

Note: The use of rand member is purely for educational purpose and it is not recommended for real-world design as synthesis or optimization of the design using tools like Xilinx ISE or Verilog are designed to avoid the usage of rand member. In such case, the design should be designed in such a way that it can cover all possible scenarios without using rand member. It is advisable to use the use of rand member for generating randomized stimulus during simulations. However, for real-world design, rand members should be avoided to keep the design simple and efficient for synthesis and optimization.

Also, it's important to note that the rand variables may not be supported in all simulators or tools, and their usage might not be fully compatible or optimized in a particular design. It is common to see the rand keyword used for the purpose of generating random stimulus during simulation. 

To summarize, the `rand` keyword is a useful tool for design verification but it should be used
