```verilog
module par(
input [7:0] in,
output reg parity,
output reg all_ones);

struct packed {
    logic [1:0] x1;
    logic [1:0] x2;
    logic [1:0] x3;
    logic [1:0] x4;
} in_;

assign in_ = in;

always @(*) begin
    parity = ^{in_.x1, in_.x2, in_.x3, in_.x4};
    all_ones = &{in_.x1, in_.x2, in_.x3, in_.x4};
end
endmodule
```
In the above code, the unpacked struct `in_` is declared with logic fields `x1`, `x2`, `x3`, `x4`. 

The values of `x1`, `x2`, `x3`, `x4` are assigned based on the input `in`. 

In the `always` block, the `parity` and `all_ones` are calculated using the XOR and AND operations on the `in_` structure.

This approach not only tests the structure-based logic operations but also prepares the `in` values as packed struct for the XOR and AND operations. It allows complex operations to be performed on the structured inputs.

Please note that this code assumes that input `in` is a 7-bit concatenation of x4, x3, x2, x1. The behavior would be undefined if the input does not follow this format. If you want to use the input in a different format, you would need to modify the unpacking of `in` into `in_`..```verilog
