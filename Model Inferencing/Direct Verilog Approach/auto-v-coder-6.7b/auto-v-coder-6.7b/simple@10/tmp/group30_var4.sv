```verilog
`timescale 1ns/1ps

module netdelay1(x,y);
input [31:0] x;
output [31:0] y;
wire #(2,1) nn; // Declare wire 'nn' with rise=2, fall=1 delay
not (nn,x); // Assign NOT(x) to 'nn' (takes effect after rise/fall delay)
assign y=nn; // Assign 'nn' to 'y' (direct assignment)
endmodule
```
In this code, the inputs 'x' and 'y' are each defined as 32-bit wide, the 'not' operator is applied to each bit of 'x' individually, then the network delay will be respected and the output 'y' will be set accordingly.

This design also has been modified to reflect the concept of structural granularity where every signal is considered as a separate bit or field. As a result, the output 'y' is defined as a unit width packed structure with 32 fields, allowing for direct assignment of the result of 'not' operation.

Remember, the delays were for illustration purposes only and might not match the actual delay in the physical design due to various factors like device timing and internal routing. Hence, this is a simple example for understanding the concept and not an optimized design.
