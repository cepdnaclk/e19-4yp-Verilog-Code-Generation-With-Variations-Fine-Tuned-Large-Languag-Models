logic [7:0] simulated_output;

initial begin
    D = 8'b01010101;
    Clock = 8'b00100100;
    Resetn = 8'b10011001;
    expected_output = 8'b10101010;
    #10;
    assert(Q === expected_output) else $error("test failed");
end
endmodule
```
### Explanation:
The testbench was modified to use an 8-bit dynamic array as inputs. Therefore, the testbench uses 8-bit fixed inputs, as in the original code, but with dynamic arrays.

The testbench will compare the expected output (8'b10101010) with the simulated output (Q). If they are not the same, a Verilog error message ($error) is printed to the console.

The assert statement in the initial block runs the testbench for several cycles. The #10 at the end is a delay statement that delays execution by 10 nanoseconds. This is a common convention to specify the delay before the assertion happens, in order to allow the design to settle before asserting the results.

The inputs and expected outputs are all set to specific 8-bit values for this example. This code could easily be modified to use any 8-bit values by simply assigning new values to the D, Clock, Resetn, and expected_output variables.

The main DFlipFlop module has been left unchanged to demonstrate that it works correctly as a basic circuit.

Remember to replace `8'b01010101`, `8'b00100100` and `8'b10011001` with your dynamic values. These are simple 8-bit binary values used for verification.
