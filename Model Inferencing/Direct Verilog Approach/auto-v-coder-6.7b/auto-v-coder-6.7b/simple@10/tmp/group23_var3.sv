```verilog
module FourFlopsByteStructL #(parameter DClk = 2, DBuf = 1)
(output byte[3:0] Q, input byte[3:0] D, input Ena, Clk);
byte[3:0] QWire;
localparam DTot = DBuf + DClk;
DFF DReg[3:0] (.Q(QWire),.D(D),.Clk(Clk));
assign #DTot Q = (Ena==1'b1)? QWire : 'bz;
endmodule
```
This modified version replaces the logic type with byte type in the input and output vector of the module. This will enable testing byte-type vector compatibility using the DFF and FourFlopsByteStructL module. The DClk and DBuf parameters serve the same purpose as in the initial code, but they can be adjusted for specific test cases. 

Note that Verilog does not have a strict byte data type, and it will behave identically to logic vectors in this case. The data type is an attribute that can be used to indicate the bit width (8-bit) of the data. In practice, a byte in Verilog behaves like a 8-bit logic vector, but the syntax is designed to indicate that the type being used is one byte wide. This can be used to help in understanding the code better, but would not affect the actual functionality.```verilog
module DFF (output reg Q, input D, Clk);
always @(posedge Clk) begin
    Q <= D;
end
endmodule
