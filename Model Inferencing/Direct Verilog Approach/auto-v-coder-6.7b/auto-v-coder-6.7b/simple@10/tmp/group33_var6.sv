```
module ha_1(s,ca,a,b); // Half Adder with gate delays
  input a,b; output s,ca;
  localparam type DelayType = struct signed {
    int xor_delay;
    int and_delay;
  };
  localparam DelayType delays = '{signed'(1), signed'(2)}; // xor delay
  localparam DelayType another_delays = '{signed'(3), signed'(4)}; // and delay
  xor #(delays.xor_delay, delays.xor_delay) (s,a,b);
  and #(another_delays.and_delay, another_delays.and_delay) (ca,a,b);
endmodule
```
In this code, the xor and and delays are now stored in an unpacked structure with signed members, which allows for the parameters to be driven by values stored in the structure itself. This will prevent hard coding values into the module and will make it easier to modify the delays as needed.

Please note that using struct with signed members could be an overkill for simple design, considering that the task asks to modify the delay parameters of gate delays. In such cases, it is much simpler to just manually change the delay values in the module definition as shown in the initial code. This solution is more suitable for complex designs where gate delays are driven by parameters stored in an unpacked structure.
  
Also, this solution is not universally valid in all Verilog simulators. Not all simulators support using struct and unpacked array members in xor and and gate delays. Therefore, if you're using a simulator that doesn't support it, you should use the original code with fixed delays. It's also worth noting that xor and and delays are not the only parameters that could be packed and modified. You may need to use the same approach when modifying the delay values for other parameters in your design. right. 

Adding such a feature to your design can help to make the design more adaptable and modular. It provides more flexibility in terms of changing parameter values without having to manually modify the module code every time. right. 

This approach provides a more systematic way to modify parameters of a module without having to do it manually,
