```verilog
module tst_dff_pbeh();
  logic di,clk; wire do;
  dff_p d1(do,di,clk); // Instantiate DFF with path delay
  initial begin clk=0; di=1'b0; #35 $stop; end // Initialize & stop
  always #3 clk=~clk; // Generate clock (negedges at 6, 12, 18...)
  always #5 di=~di; // Toggle data
  initial $monitor($time,"clk=%b, di=%b, do=%b",clk,di,do);
endmodule
```

In this code:

- The logic and wire types are used as the verilog equivalent to the logic and reg types.
- The `always` statement is replaced with an initial block to ensure proper simulation sequence.
- The `initial` block is used to simulate the clock and data input.
- The `initial` block is also used to stop the simulation after a specified time. 
- The `$monitor` command is used to print out the current state of the DFF at each time step.

This verilog code can now be simulated in a verilog simulation tool to test a D Flip Flop (DFF) with path delay. Note that the actual dff_p behavior will still need to be defined in the dff_p module to match the description in the testbench. 

This code is compatible with SystemVerilog and verilog standards. It is meant to provide an example of how one might modify the code to test an external module. It's important to note that the specific code for the DFF module (`dff_p`) and its function will depend on the specific requirements of your project. 

Also, note that Verilog and SystemVerilog both use different syntax and features. The code from this instruction is a basic example on how to simulate a D Flip Flop, but any specific behavior for the external module (`dff_p`) will need to be implemented according to the specific requirements of the project.```verilog
module dff_p(reg do,di,clk);
