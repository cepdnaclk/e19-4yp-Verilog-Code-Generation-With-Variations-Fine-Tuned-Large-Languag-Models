```verilog
module gade(a,a1,b,c,b1,c1);
input logic [1:0] b,c;
input logic [1:0] b1,c1;
output logic [1:0] a,a1;

always_comb begin
    // Instantiate OR gate with inertial delay 3
    a1[1:0] <= #3 (c1[1:0] | b1[1:0]);
    // Instantiate AND gate with rise=2, fall=1 inertial delay
    a[1:0] <= #(2,1) (c[1:0] & b[1:0]);
end
endmodule
```
In this solution, an array of two bits is used for the inputs and the outputs. 

The `always_comb` block is used to define a combinatorial function, which means the output is determined by the current state of the input without any delay. The `#` operator is used to apply a specified delay (rise, fall) at the same time. 

The OR gate operation is done after a delay of 3, and the AND gate operation is done after a delay of 2. Note that the syntax for specifying delays is slightly different in Verilog compared to the delay in the base code.

The code demonstrates the usage of delay modifiers `#` in Verilog and the use of inertial delay for OR and AND gates. It also demonstrates the handling of nested unpacked structures in Verilog. Note that this code assumes that the input and output bitstreams are 2-bit arrays, which can be changed to suit the specific requirements. 

Please note that the delay values of the gates are set to 3 and 2, and they are used for testing the delay modifier in Verilog. However, the actual delay that will be applied to the gates can depend on the clock period and the synthesis tool used. It's important to use appropriate delay values for the specific design and project requirements.

Please also remember that Verilog delays are static. If you want to define dynamic delays (for example, the propagation delay of registers), you would need to use `# (random_delay())` syntax.### Additional Note:
This code doesn't do any simulation.
