In the modified code, we create the `input_bus` structure and instantiate the `ha_9` module with the signals from the struct. The `in_data` variable is used for driving `a` and `b`. We use the struct's property that it can be used to give a meaningful name to the packed structure. Note that in this modification, the `always` block no longer drives `a` and `b` directly but instead changes the `in_data` struct's properties in a cycle-by-cycle way. 

Also, note that we need to ensure that the data assigned to `a` and `b` does not go through combinatorial logic (which would make the testbench unstable). The `logic` keyword is used here to ensure that the data assigned to `a` and `b` is assigned sequentially and does not create any combinatorial paths.

This modification will help you to understand the use of structs to send complex signal patterns to the module. It also shows how to design test patterns to ensure the module is tested in a variety of conditions. This is a typical setup for any complex
