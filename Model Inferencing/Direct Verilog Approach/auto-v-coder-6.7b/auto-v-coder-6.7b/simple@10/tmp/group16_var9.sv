```verilog
// Define the structure
typedef struct packed {
  logic DataIn;
  string DataOut;
} data_t;

module orfr_tst; // Testbench for OR gate with force/release
  reg b,c; wire a;
  data_t d;
  initial begin b=1'b0; c=1'b0; #20 $stop; end // Initialize inputs
  always #3 c = ~c; // Toggle input 'c' every 3 time units
  or_fr_rl dd(a,b,c, d); // Instantiate the module containing force/release
endmodule
```
In this case, the OR gate will be forced to always output 1 at the DataOut field during simulation, and the DataIn field will be released for all the time unit simulations. This variation is very useful in debugging or testing structures with logic and string fields in Verilog.

Please replace `or_fr_rl` in the last line with the actual module name and make sure it works with this variation. Also, the signal names `a`, `b` and `c` should be replaced with actual signal names in your design when you have them. These changes are for demonstration only and should be removed or customized for your actual design.

Remember to recompile your design when you make changes to the Verilog code.### TUTORIAL LINK:
