```verilog
// Create a module with one input and one output that behaves like a wire
module wire_assign(input logic [10:0] in, output logic [10:0] out);
    // assign out to in
    assign out = in;
endmodule
```

Now, we need to create a test bench to verify this design:

### Test Bench:
```verilog
module test_wire_assign;
    // clock and reset signals
    logic clk;
    logic reset;
    // input and output signals
    logic [10:0] in, out;
    // instantiate the design
    wire_assign uut(
       .in(in), 
       .out(out)
    );
    // generate clock and reset
    always #5 clk <= ~clk;
    initial begin
        clk <= 0;
        reset <= 1;
        in <= 0;
        #10;
        reset <= 0;
    end
    // simulate the design
    initial begin
        repeat(10) begin
            in <= in + 1;
            @(posedge clk);
        end
        $finish;
    end
    // dump waves
    initial begin
        $dumpfile("dump.vcd");
        $dumpvars(0, test_wire_assign);
    end
endmodule
```

In this test bench, we first declare the clock and reset signals. Then, we declare the input and output signals as 11-bit wide signals. In the actual module instantiation, we bind the output from the module to the output signal in the test bench.

The initial block at the end of the test bench is used to set the reset and input signals. After that, a simulation loop is created for the module under test. This loop increments the input signal and then waits for the next clock edge. The simulation ends after 10 increments.

Finally, the dumpfile and dumpvars statements are used to generate a dumpfile for the simulation that can be used for viewing the waveforms of the simulated system.

Note: The Verilog code above does not have a wildcard indexed associative array, so we kept the input and output signals as 11-bit wide signals. This is
