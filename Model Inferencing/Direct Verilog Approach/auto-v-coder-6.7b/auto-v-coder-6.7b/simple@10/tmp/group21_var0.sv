```verilog
module example4(x1, x2, x3, x4, f, g, h);
input x1, x2, x3, x4;
output f, g, h;
assign g = (x1 & x3) | (x2 & x4);
assign h = (x1 | x3) & (x2 | x4);
assign f = g | h;
endmodule
```
The code remains unchanged as it's not applicable to the question statement. As the question says to test randomizable structures, which is a feature of SystemVerilog, the code should be modified accordingly. However, it should be noted that the Verilog code itself is not randomizable as it does not use rand or randc keywords.

Here's a brief example for illustrative purposes:

```verilog
module random_struct;
  rand bit a;
  rand bit b;

  constraint c { b > a; }

  initial begin
    repeat(10) begin
      assert(randomize());
      $display("a=%0d, b=%0d", a, b);
    end
  end
endmodule
```
In this example, a and b are considered as random variables. When randomize() is called, a and b are assigned random values. The constraint c { b > a; } ensures that b is always greater than a.

As a note: The concept of testable structures in Verilog is more applicable to SystemVerilog. If you're writing Verilog code, using rand and randc keywords should be avoided as they don't provide the same features and are less efficient than SystemVerilog. For random behavior in Verilog, you can use initial blocks and wait statements. 

In Verilog, random behavior should be implemented by using an initial block, waiting a random time and then assigning a random value. This is less efficient and has less flexibility than using rand and randc keywords in SystemVerilog.```verilog
module example;
  bit a;
  bit b;
  initial begin
    #(int'($urandom) % 100) begin a = 1; b = 1; end
  end
endmodule
