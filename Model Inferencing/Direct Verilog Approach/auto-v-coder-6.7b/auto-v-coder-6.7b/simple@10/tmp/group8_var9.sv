```verilog
module IR #(parameter ADDR_WIDTH = 2, parameter REG_WIDTH = 8) (input [ADDR_WIDTH-1:0] addr_in, input [REG_WIDTH-1:0] data_in, input load, clk,
output reg [REG_WIDTH-1:0] data_out [0:2**ADDR_WIDTH-1]);

always @( posedge clk )
if ( load ) begin
    data_out[addr_in] <= data_in;
end
endmodule
```

In this code, we use parameters ADDR_WIDTH and REG_WIDTH to define the address and register widths respectively. We have a single input for the address and a single input for the data. The data is loaded into the register on the posedge of the clock when load is high.

The code also uses the addr_in as the address to load the data into the array, effectively treating addr_in as a 1-D dimensional array.

The modified module has been designed to accept a 1D array with the index as the address to load the data into the array. This code can handle multi-dimensional arrays with the help of the addr_in.

### Assumptions:
1. We assume that ADDR_WIDTH defines the maximum address that can be encoded in the addr_in.
2. We assume that REG_WIDTH defines the width of the data that can be loaded into the array.
3. For the 1D array, the array is assumed to have 2^ADDR_WIDTH elements. 

For example, with ADDR_WIDTH=2 and REG_WIDTH=8, `data_out` is a 4-element 1D array. The `addr_in` is a 2-bit address that can take values 0 to 3. You can replace these assumptions with your specific needs.

Again, this code demonstrates the use of logic packed arrays, and the ability to handle multi-dimensional indexing as well as load and store operations. ### Please note that there may be other ways to solve the same problem depending upon the specifics of your design including different modules, clock gating, etc. This is just one possible solution.
