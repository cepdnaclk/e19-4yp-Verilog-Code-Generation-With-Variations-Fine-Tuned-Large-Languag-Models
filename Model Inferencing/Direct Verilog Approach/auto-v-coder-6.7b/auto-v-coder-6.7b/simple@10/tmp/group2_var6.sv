```verilog
module test;
wire a;

// define packed structure
typedef struct packed {
    logic x;
    logic y;
    logic z;
} packed_str;

packed_str my_packed_str;

assign #25 a = 1;
always begin
    my_packed_str = {1'b1, 1'b0, 1'b1}; // set x, y, z values
end
endmodule
```

In this case, we have replaced the reg declarations with a packed structure, which lets us assign multiple variables at once. We are using this packed structure to assign values to x, y, z and we are assigning `1` to the packed structure my_packed_str. The values are assigned to the packed structure in a way that would be equivalent to what was done with the reg declarations.

This variation ensures that packed structures work as expected in Verilog, giving developers more flexibility in their design with packed structures and also allowing for more complex logic combinations.

This also demonstrates the flexibility and versatility of Verilog in handling packed structures, which can be used in a variety of ways depending on the specific needs of the design.
