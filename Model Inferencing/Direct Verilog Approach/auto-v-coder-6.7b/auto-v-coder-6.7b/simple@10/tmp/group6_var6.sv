module ALU ( input [7:0] a, b, input pass, add,
output logic[7:0] alu_out );
// Simple combinational ALU
always @(a or b or pass or add)
if (pass) alu_out = a;       // Pass input 'a'
else if (add) alu_out = a + b; // Add inputs 'a' and 'b'
else alu_out = 0;           // Default output is 0
endmodule
This revised version of the ALU module adheres to modern Verilog standards for signal declaration. It ensures that the output is declared as a logic type, which is the preferred method for signals in modern Verilog. This change will avoid any possible issues related to Verilog's support for the use of types of signal declarations.
