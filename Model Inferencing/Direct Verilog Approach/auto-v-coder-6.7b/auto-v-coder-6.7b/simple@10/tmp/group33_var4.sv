```verilog
module ha_2(s,ca,a,b); // Half Adder with gate delays driven by unpacked structure
  input a,b; output s,ca;
  wire w_a, w_b, w_s, w_ca, w_cb;
  xor #(w_a.delay,w_a.width1,w_b.delay,w_b.width1) (w_s,w_a,w_b);
  and #(w_a.delay,w_a.width1,w_b.delay,w_b.width1) (w_ca,w_a,w_b);
  assign s = w_s;
  assign ca = w_ca;
endmodule
```
In the modified code, the parameters (delay, width1) of xor and and are driven by the members of an unpacked structure representing the parameters of the two gates. However, the width of the delay is not explicitly represented.

Note: This code is hypothetical and does not represent an actual Verilog implementation. It will not compile. Verilog does not support passing gate delays as an unpacked structure. Delays need to be constant expressions.

For actual Verilog code, it would be better represented as separate parameters or variables. The width and delay of each gate could be passed as a parameter in a module instantiation. This makes the design more generic and flexible.

In more realistic scenarios, parameter values could be loaded from a RTL-level parameters file or driven from an external configuration, but these are generally not supported here. They are typically used at the module level, and not at the instantiation level.

In summary, the requirement of passing delays through an unpacked structure is not supported in Verilog. The delay value is usually hard-coded with the gate delay parameter value. These values cannot be dynamically assigned by code.

A more realistic approach would be to use gate delay attributes in the Verilog code:
```verilog
module ha_2(s, ca, a, b); // Half Adder with gate delays driven by attributes
  input a, b; output s, ca;
  xor #1 (s, a, b) delay_set(w_s, w_a, w_
