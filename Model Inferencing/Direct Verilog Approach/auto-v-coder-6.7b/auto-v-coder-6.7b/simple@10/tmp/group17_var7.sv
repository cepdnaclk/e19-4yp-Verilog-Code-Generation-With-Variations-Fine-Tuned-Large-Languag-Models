```verilog
module ALU (input logic [3:0] ArgA, ArgB, input logic Clk, output logic [3:0] Result);

always @(posedge Clk) begin
    // signed addition
    Result <= $signed(ArgA) + $signed(ArgB);
end

// specify timing constraints
specify
    specparam tRise = 5, tFall = 4;
    (Clk *> Result) = (tRise, tFall);
endspecify

endmodule
```

This modified ALU module uses logic signed data types for the ArgA and ArgB inputs, and the Result output. The `$signed` function is used to convert the inputs to signed, allowing the addition operation to work for signed arithmetic. The "always" block ensures the result is updated on each clock cycle. The timing constraints are specified using the "specify" and "endspecify" keywords.

Testing can be done with a testbench using signed numbers. For example, if ArgA is -4 and ArgB is 3, the result should be -1. When you compare the Result to -1, if it matches, then the operation is successful. Test with signed numbers.

This approach allows for testing signed arithmetic operations without the need for complex hardware or specialized testing tools. It's also more aligned with Verilog's built-in support for signed arithmetic operations.

Keep in mind that timing constraints are based on physical implementation and might not reflect the timing required for the synthesis tool. This code is purely illustrative and may require adjustments based on the particular tool used for synthesis.### Note:

Verilog allows the use of the $signed and $unsigned functions for signed and unsigned arithmetic respectively. This is a built-in functionality of Verilog and does not need any special tools or packages to use.

The signed operation is useful for arithmetic operations that deal with signed numbers. For unsigned arithmetic, you can use the built-in functionality of Verilog/systemverilog.

Please, if you want to test your design with an external tool, ensure it is capable of handling Verilog's built-in functionality for signed arithmetic operations. This code is designed to provide a simple example of signed arithmetic operations and timing constraints in
