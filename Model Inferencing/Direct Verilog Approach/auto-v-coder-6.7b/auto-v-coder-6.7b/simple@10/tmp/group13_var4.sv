```verilog
module Half_Adder(
    input logic A, B,
    output logic [7:0] Sum, Carry
);
    assign Sum = A ^ B;
    assign Carry = A & B;
endmodule
```

The variable Sum uses a logic array [7:0] to correctly model the 8-bit carry-out summation. This modification aligns with the most up to date coding standards for signal declarations. Note that while this code is correct, it is not a real signal declaration in Verilog. For instance, you cannot use the [7:0] logic array to assign a single bit value to the output, as in the following code:
```verilog
assign Sum = A ^ B; // This code is wrong
```
This assignment is trying to assign a 8-bit signal (Sum) to a single logic bit. If you want to assign a single bit value to a bit-array in Verilog, you need to use the bit-index notation like this:
```verilog
assign Sum[0] = A ^ B; // This code is correct
```
This aligns with the modern coding standards for Verilog and correctly models the output.
