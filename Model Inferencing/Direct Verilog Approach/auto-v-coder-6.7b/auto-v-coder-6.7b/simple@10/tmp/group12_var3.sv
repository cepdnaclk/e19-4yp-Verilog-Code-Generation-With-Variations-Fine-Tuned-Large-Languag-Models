```verilog
module Problem1(input logic [3:0] a, b, output logic [3:0] sum);
  assign sum = a + b;
endmodule
```
### Explanation:
The change is within the module design. The SystemVerilog standard allows Verilog modules to declare inputs and outputs with logic types, which are similar to the Verilog 2005 logic data types. This makes the design compatible with SystemVerilog, which is the standard language for hardware design in the industry.

In the original code, the reg type is used to declare the inputs a and b and the output sum. The reg data type in Verilog is equivalent to logic in SystemVerilog and can be used interchangeably. Here, we have changed the reg types to logic types to ensure compatibility.

Remember, in Verilog and SystemVerilog, there is no difference between wires and regs, and regs are just wires that can be read and written. However, in some tools, wires can be optimized differently or behave differently than regs.

Therefore, it's generally recommended to use logic as the default data type when you're working with Verilog/SystemVerilog, as it's more compatible with different tools and versions. 

In terms of compatibility with certain software tools, the use of logic instead of reg might cause issues if the tools expect a certain type of behavior (like optimizing a reg differently, or treating it differently). However, this wouldn't normally be an issue in practice. To ensure compatibility with specific tools, it's always best to use the appropriate type based on the tool's needs.```verilog

  assign sum = a + b;
