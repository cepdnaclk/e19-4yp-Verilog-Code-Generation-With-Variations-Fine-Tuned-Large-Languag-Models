```verilog
module ALU (output logic signed [31:0] Result, input logic signed [31:0] ArgA, ArgB, input Clk);

specify
    specparam tRise = 5, tFall = 4;
    (Clk *> Result) = (tRise, tFall);
endspecify

endmodule
```
In this modified code, the inputs ArgA, ArgB and the output Result are declared as logic signed [31:0], which means they are signed 32-bit quantities. The input clocks are also declared as logic inputs. This code should work with a 32-bit clock signal (50% duty cycle should be fine for simulation). This is an example of verifying the behavior of a signed arithmetic operation on the ALU. 

Please note that the actual behavior of the ALU in a real hardware design will depend on the operation selected (i.e., ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV etc.) and the conditions of the input data. This is a simulation verification to confirm that the input and output signals behave as expected. 

Remember to create testbench stimulus to confirm the correctness of these operations, especially for signed arithmetic. Verilog allows signed arithmetic to be tested using a variety of operations. It is important to understand the limitations of testbench design when dealing with signed quantities. For instance, subtracting a larger number from a smaller number in signed arithmetic can overflow the 4-bit signed [3:0] vector. 

Also, remember that this is a simple code example and does not include error checking or overflow protection mechanisms. These should be part of a more comprehensive testbench.

Finally, remember that synthesizing this code into hardware will likely lead to incorrect or unpredictable results due to the use of the'signed' keyword which is not supported in all synthesis tools. Hence, synthesizing this code to hardware is not recommended. This example was meant to illustrate the correct usage of'signed' keyword in Verilog.```verilog
module ALU (output logic signed [31:0] Result, input logic signed [31:0] ArgA, ArgB);

always_comb begin
    Result = ArgA + ArgB; // Addition operation
end
