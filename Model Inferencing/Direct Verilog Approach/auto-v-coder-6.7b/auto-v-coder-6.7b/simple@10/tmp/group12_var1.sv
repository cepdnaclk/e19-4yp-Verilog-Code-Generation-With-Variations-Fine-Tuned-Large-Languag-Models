```verilog
module Problem1(input logic [3:0] a, b, output logic [3:0] sum);
  assign sum = a + b;
endmodule
```
In this variation, we have changed the reg declarations for a and b from reg to logic, which is the recommended way to declare variables in Verilog. This should make the code more compatible with SystemVerilog syntax.

However, please note that in SystemVerilog, reg is considered obsolete and replaced with logic. So, it is suggested to update your code to use logic instead of reg.

Also, verilog doesn't support "output logic [3:0] sum". If you want to declare multiple outputs, you need to declare them as `output logic`.

If you want to declare outputs as reg types, you can use `output reg [3:0] sum`. This will work but it's not recommended for new designs as reg in Verilog is considered obsolete.

Lastly, please ensure that your synthesis tool or simulator is capable of interpreting and compiling this code as intended. This code is still written in Verilog and might have compatibility issues if you're using a different synthesis tool than what was used to create the code. In such cases, make sure to ensure the synthesizable code is properly written according to the tool specific rules.

Please note that the changes made here are purely a syntax change, the code functionally remains the same. This is just a stylistic change to ensure compatibility with SystemVerilog syntax.```verilog
module Problem1(input logic [3:0] a, b, output logic [3:0] sum);
  assign sum = a + b;
endmodule
