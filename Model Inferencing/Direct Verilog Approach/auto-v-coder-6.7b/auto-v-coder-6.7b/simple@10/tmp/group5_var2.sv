```verilog
module tst_dff_pbeh ();
  logic di, clk;
  wire do;
  dff_p d1(do, di, clk); // Instantiate DFF with path delay
  initial begin clk = 0; di = 1'b0; #35 $stop; end // Initialize & stop
  always #3 clk = ~clk; // Generate clock (negedges at 6, 12, 18...)
  always #5 di = ~di; // Toggle data
  initial $monitor($time,"clk=%b, di=%b, do=%b",clk, di, do);
endmodule
```

This code should result in the same functionality as the original code, but with explicit type declarations for `di` and `clk` which allows compatibility with SystemVerilog types. In SystemVerilog, logic is a synonym for reg, and wire is a synonym for reg, but it is more explicit and more compatible with other languages.
