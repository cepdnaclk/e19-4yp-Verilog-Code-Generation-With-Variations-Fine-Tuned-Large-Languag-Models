This code should be able to accommodate any number of gate delays for your design. In this case, it's assumed you have a total of 15 gates and 16 gate delay parameters. The parameters can be driven by values stored in an unpacked structure with signed members.

Note: Modifying delay parameters in a real design can be time consuming and may not yield the expected results, especially for complex designs. Use it only for testing and understanding the behavior of gates. Also, if a delay parameter is modified after synthesis, its effect in later simulation will also be modified. Make sure the delay parameters are correctly set before synthesizing the design.

Finally, keep in mind that Verilog delay parameters are only for simulation purposes and have no impact on the synthesis or implementation of your design. In synthesis, the gate delays are determined by the specific design technology implementation. Hence, the delays given in the Verilog code
