```verilog
module show_aa(ao,ai); // NOT gate with delay 2
  output ao; input ai;
  typedef enum {A, B} e_type;
  
  e_type ai;
  logic [0:0] ao;
  
  assign ao = ~ai;
endmodule
```
In this modified code, the input `ai` is declared as a packed enum with two values: `A` and `B`. The output `ao` is defined as a logic type. The `assign` statement converts the enum type input to the corresponding logic value. This will allow you to test the NOT gate with different enum inputs `A` and `B`.

Note: Enum types in Verilog are used to define new types with specific set of possible values. These values are referred to as enum elements.

For example:
```verilog
typedef enum { A = 1'b1, B = 1'b0 } e_type;
```
Defines an enum type with two elements: `A` (1'b1) and `B` (1'b0). The initial value for enums is the default value, which is `A` in this case.

This code demonstrates how to use an enum type as input to a module and how to derive a logic output from it. 

Note: In Verilog, the `assign` statement is used to connect a block of logic to a wire. The left-hand side of the assignment (`ao` in this case) is the logic block being driven whereas the right-hand side (`~ai`) is the logic to be driven into the logic block.

Please note that the syntax for defining the enum type is slightly different in the Verilog-2005 and SystemVerilog linting versions of the language. Verilog-2001 and Verilog-2005 are the two versions of Verilog and SystemVerilog is a superset of Verilog-2001. The example above uses SystemVerilog syntax, so it might need to be adjusted to fit your specific requirements. 

Also, this code assumes the input `ai` is being driven through a logic or an enum type. Please replace `~ai` with the actual
