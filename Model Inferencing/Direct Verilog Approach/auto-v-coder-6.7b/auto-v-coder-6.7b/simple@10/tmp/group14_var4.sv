In this modified code, we have replaced inputs A and B with 4-bit logic vectors, and applied the same stimulus in the `always` block. The ALU's `d_out` and `co_out` are also monitored for the updated outputs in each cycle. 

This modified code should allow us to verify the functionality of our ALU under different inputs. Note that the `f_in` is always set to `2'b00`, which means the addition operation is performed. You can change it to any other operation (like `2'b10` for subtraction, `2'b11` for multiplication) to test the ALU with different operations. The `cci_in` is always set to `1'b0` for
