```verilog
module structural_delayed_net(x,y);
input [31:0] x;
output [31:0] y;
wire [31:0] nn; // Declare wire 'nn' with rise=2, fall=1 delay
genvar i;
generate 
for(i=0;i<32;i=i+1) begin
not g_i(nn[i], x[i]); // Assign NOT(x) to 'nn' (takes effect after rise/fall delay)
end
endgenerate
assign y=nn; // Assign 'nn' to 'y' (direct assignment)
endmodule
```

This code will create a 32-bit wide 'nn' wire and a 32-bit wide 'x' input. It loops over all the bits of the input 'x' and generates a NOT gate for each bit. The result is assigned to the output 'y' after the net delay. Note that the rise and fall times for the gate delay are not specified. By default, they are 1 and 1 respectively, meaning the gate delay is 1 time unit.

Please make the necessary adjustments according to your design and simulation environment.

Also remember that verilog's net delay models are mostly used to model the delay of flip-flops and sequentially executed blocks of code. This is an idealized model and may not reflect the actual delays on a physical design. The actual delays could involve both hardware and software simulation aspects. So, in case of actual design you need to model the delays from the design point of view. ###
If you want to use the actual delay in your design, you can use the `#delay_time` delay operator in the code. This is a real delay and it is a good option for actual design. ###

Also note that Verilog has a built-in feature for delay modeling. You can use `#delay_time` operator for modeling delays in combinational logic and `always @(posedge clk)` block for modeling delays in sequential logic. However, these delays are not directly related to the delay in a net. ###

Remember modeling delays can be complex and requires careful consideration based on the design and the simulation environment. ###

So, in essence, using these
