// Verilog code for Problem 5
module Half_Adder(
    input A, B,
    output logic [7:0] Sum, Carry
);
    assign Sum = {4'b0000, A ^ B};
    assign Carry = {4'b0000, A & B};
endmodule

This version will declare the outputs as logic [7:0] for compatibility and clarity. The bit-width is 8 to align with the typical size of a 8-bit bus, but the most significant 4 bits are always assumed to be zeros. This is done to ensure the result or carry is always 4-bits wide. 

However, please note that the specific size of the output bus depends on your specific design requirements and constraints. If the sum or carry can be greater than 8 bits in size, you would need to adjust the output size accordingly.

Remember to always ensure the bit-width of the output matches the expected size of the sum or carry. This is a common mistake for beginners. ###

If you are looking for a 4-bit half adder, you should simply specify the bit-width of the output Sum and Carry as 4. You can adjust the assignments accordingly. In such case, the output declaration would look like:

```verilog
output logic [3:0] Sum, Carry
```

And the assignments would look like:

```verilog
assign Sum = {1'b0, A ^ B};
assign Carry = {1'b0, A & B};
```

This way the output would be a pair of 4-bit values for the sum and the carry. The MSB of each output would always be zero due to the '1'b0 concatenation. The remaining bits will be the sum or carry of the A and B inputs.![](https://i.imgur.com/JFXK5RY.jpg)

Remember to update the code with the correct size of the outputs for your specific design.<API_RUN_START>```verilog
