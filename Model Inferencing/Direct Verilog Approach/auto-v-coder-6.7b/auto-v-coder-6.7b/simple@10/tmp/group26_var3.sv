With this revised code, you can synthesize and test the functionality of the code in Verilog. In the testbench module, we are applying sequential inputs to the DUT (Device Under Test) and observing the output changes. The timing diagrams for all the gated operations are also present. This code will give you an idea how to test your Verilog code.

Please note that this is a very basic program, and in a real-world application, you would also need to add more input/output ports for full testing. This is just to illustrate how you can test your original code.

To simulate this Verilog code, you'll need a simulator like ModelSim or VCS. Ensure that you have the necessary Verilog libraries imported, and run the simulation to check for any errors or warnings. 

This process would be the same for
