```verilog
module func1(x1, x2, x3, f);
input logic x1, x2, x3;
output logic signed [1:0] f;
assign f = (~x1 & ~x2 & x3) | (~x1 & x2 & ~x3) | (x1 & ~x2 & x3) | (x1 & x2 & ~x3)? 2'b01 : 2'b00;
endmodule
```

In this code, the output type is `logic signed [1:0]`, which means it's a signed logic vector with 2 bits. The first and last bit represent the sign (signed), and the middle bit represents the magnitude of the number. The `?:` construct is used to encode the 4 possible output values as 2'b01 and 2'b00 for all possible combinations of the three inputs. If the boolean output of the expression is 1, it assigns the output to 2'b01. If the boolean output is 0, it assigns the output to 2'b00. This verilog code also includes the output type declaration as `logic signed [1:0]`. Please note that the assignment part might seem complex because of the use of `?:` in verilog. It assigns the value in the statement before the `?:`, when the condition before the `?:` is true; otherwise, it assigns the value after the `?:`.

It's important to note that verilog has several types of logic vectors, and as such, the code can be modified according to the specific requirements of the use case. 

Please remember to change the input and output logic and signed logic vector according to your logic design and requirement. 

Also, for a simple gate level logic design, considering the boolean logic of the given expression, it's usually straightforward to use `assign` as shown above. For a more complex design, additional modules or structural verilog constructs may be needed.

Please, note that the code above is an example of how you could encode the given expression into a 2-bit signed logic vector. The actual implementation depending on the exact requirements of the logic design is much more complex. The expression given in the task is a simple
