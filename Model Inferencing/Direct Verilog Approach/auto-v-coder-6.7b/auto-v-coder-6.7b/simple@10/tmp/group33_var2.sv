```verilog
// Structure for gate delays
struct packed {
  int s;
  int ca;
} gate_delays;

module ha_1(s,ca,a,b); // Half Adder with gate delays
  input a,b; output s,ca;
  xor #(gate_delays.s) (s,a,b);
  and #(gate_delays.ca) (ca,a,b);
endmodule
```
This modified code uses `struct` to create a packed structure for the gate delays, which have signed members `s` and `ca`. The delay values for the `xor` and `and` gates are now driven by the members of this structure. The delay values are used as the first argument in the delay attribute `#()`.

Please, ensure that both `s` and `ca` values are within the defined range in your specific Verilog compiler and environment. Some compilers do not support negative delay values.### Notes:

This code is not optimal as it does not provide any additional functionality. It only changes the delays of the `xor` and `and` gates, which are not directly contributing to the functionality of the half adder. In a typical half adder design, the delay values are not used directly in the delay attributes. Rather, they are used to model the propagation delay of the gates in the design.

This code does not include any form of logic control; it merely specifies the parameters of the gates which are being used in the design. For typical use-cases, Verilog designs would define logic control signals, logic gates, and specific delays as part of a comprehensive design under the control of a top-level module which orchestrates these various elements in a specific manner.

It's important to note that this code assumes the existence of a `gate_delays` structure in the scope of the `xor` and `and` gates. This structure would typically be assigned a constant value at the top-level module before the instantiation of `ha_1`. As such, this code is also incomplete and lacks the ability to configure the delays in a flexible manner.

For a more comprehensive design, consider including parameters in the instantiation of the module which can be defined and controlled at the top level of the design, including the structure `gate
