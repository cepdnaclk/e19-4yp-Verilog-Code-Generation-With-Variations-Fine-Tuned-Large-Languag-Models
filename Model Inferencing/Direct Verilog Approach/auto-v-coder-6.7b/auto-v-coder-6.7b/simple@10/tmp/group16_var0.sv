```verilog
module orfr_tst; // Testbench for OR gate with force/release
  reg b, c;
  wire a;
  typedef struct packed {
      logic data;
      string str;
  } DataIn;

  typedef struct packed {
      logic data;
      string str;
  } DataOut;

  initial begin b=1'b0; c=1'b0; #20 $stop; end // Initialize inputs
  always #3 c = ~c; // Toggle input 'c' every 3 time units
  orfr_rl dd(a,b,c); // Instantiate the module containing force/release
endmodule
```
In this code, the types DataIn and DataOut are packed and contain a logic field and a string field, respectively. You can initialize these structures with different values as needed.

The testbench is set up to toggle the input 'c' every 3 time units and stop after 20 time units. The instantiated module or_fr_rl takes the output 'a' and two inputs, 'b' and 'c'. The force/release feature is used to manipulate the output 'a' with respect to the inputs 'b' and 'c' in the module or_fr_rl.

The module or_fr_rl contains force/release functions to simulate the gate operation. Force/release functionality allows you to control and manipulate the value of signals for simulation purposes. It is typically used for testing the behavior of a design under specific conditions.

Remember to replace the `or_fr_rl` with the actual module name if different. Otherwise, the testbench will not compile due to the non-existent module.

Also, note that the force/release functionality will only be available in certain simulators, and the behavior may vary across different simulators. Always verify the availability and correctness of force/release functionality in your specific simulator. 

In Verilog, `string` type can't be used as an input or output. If you want to simulate a string data input or output, you need to use `string` type as a module parameter or parameterized module, and pass it as input or output.

The packed structure allows to minimize the storage and also gives the flexibility to define the bit width
