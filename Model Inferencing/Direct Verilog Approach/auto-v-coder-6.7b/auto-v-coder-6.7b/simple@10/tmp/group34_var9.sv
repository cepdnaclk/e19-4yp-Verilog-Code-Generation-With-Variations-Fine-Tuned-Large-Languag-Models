Below is the modified Verilog code with wildcard-indexed associative array as input.

```verilog
// Create a module with an input associative array and one output that behaves like a wire
module wire_assign( input wire [string type] associative_array, output wire out );
    // assign out to the element in the associative array
    assign out = associative_array["*"];
endmodule
```
Test the module with various inputs to test wildcard indexing. Note that the output will always be the same for a given associative array due to the behaviour of wildcard indexing, which always returns the value of the last element in a sequence.

This code should be used for a specific use case where you are looking to access the last element of an associative array.

Please note that using associative arrays and wildcard indexing is a part of the SystemVerilog language features and is not supported in Verilog. For using associative arrays, you should use the `type` keyword instead of `string`. It's a way to define a type and an associative array of that type.

If you're not using SystemVerilog, then the above code won't work. You should use a simple array with a constant size and access it by index. 

Please note that the actual effect of this code would depend on the exact nature of the `associative_array` and the `out` being assigned to. It is recommended to thoroughly test your design before proceeding with this approach.

If the `out` should be assigned to a different element of the array, you should adjust the index accordingly. For example, if you want to assign `out` to the element of the array that is the third element, you should use `out = associative_array[2]`. In this case, the wildcard index `["*"]` would still work, but it would simply return the value of the last element (third element in this case). 

Also keep in mind that since the wildcard index would always return the value of the last element, the ordering of elements in the associative array does not matter. Elements can be added or removed at any point in the associative array and the module will still behave as intended.

In summary, this example is theoretical and might not be used in practical situations, but
