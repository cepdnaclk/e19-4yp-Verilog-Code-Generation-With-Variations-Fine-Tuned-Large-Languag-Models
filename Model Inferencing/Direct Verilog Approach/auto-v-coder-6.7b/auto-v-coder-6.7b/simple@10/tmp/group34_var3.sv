```verilog
// Create a module with one input and one output that behaves like a wire
module wire_assign( input [3:0] keys [4:0], output [3:0] out);
    // assign out to in
    for(i=0; i<=4; i++)
    begin
        always_comb
            out[i] = keys[i]; // wildcard indexing
    end
endmodule
```
In this modified code, we have an input associated array `keys` with 4 inputs (`keys [4:0]`) each input is 4 bits wide (`[3:0]`). The output `out` is also an associative array of 4 outputs, each 4 bits wide (`[3:0]`). I have used a loop to assign each output to the corresponding input. This will effectively wire the inputs to the outputs, as if they were the same signal.

To test this code, you can use a waveform viewer like GTKWave or use a simulator like ModelSim or Icarus Verilog to monitor the changes of the inputs and outputs. Just make sure to update the input array `keys` in the testbench code to see the changes in the output array `out`.

Please note that this code does not include any testbench or any I/O definitions. You would likely have to define these in your testbench code to test this module.

Remember that in Verilog, array indices start from 0, and this code will not work as expected if you don't assign inputs to all 4 indices in the array, since it only uses the first 4. This is a simplified example for understanding the effect of wildcard indexing. In actual designs, the index might vary and needs to be managed accordingly.
Also, for wildcard indexing to work properly, you need to use SystemVerilog (SV) and you might need to compile with `-sv` flag if you are using Icarus Verilog.

This modified code is an example for understanding how to use wildcard indexing in Verilog. It's worth noting that using wildcard indexing in SystemVerilog for hardware design is not a good practice since it may lead to misunderstanding, as it doesn't provide any compile-time checking for
