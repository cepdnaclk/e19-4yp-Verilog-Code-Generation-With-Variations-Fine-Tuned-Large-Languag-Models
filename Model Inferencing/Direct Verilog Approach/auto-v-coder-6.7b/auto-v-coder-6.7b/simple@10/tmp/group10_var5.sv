This modified version is compatible with logic type outputs but may not be supported by all synthesis tools. In some cases, it can be necessary to explicitly specify the type of the output to ensure compatibility. If you're using a specific synthesis tool where logic is not compatible, you would likely need to perform a data-conversion in order to get the correct outputs.

Note: If you're not using a specific tool, try to switch to the logic type and see whether it works with the tool you're using. If it doesn't, you should consider changing the logic to wires or other compatible types.```
