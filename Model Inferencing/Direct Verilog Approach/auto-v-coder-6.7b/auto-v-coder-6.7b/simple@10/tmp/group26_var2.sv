```verilog
module gade(a,a1,b,c,b1,c1);
input b,c,b1,c1;
output a,a1;
// Instantiate OR gate with inertial delay 3
or #3 gg1(a1,c1,b1);
// Instantiate AND gate with rise=2, fall=1 inertial delay
and #(2,1) gg2(a,c,b);
endmodule
```
This code provides a simple example of how to use inertial delay, rise and fall delays, and how to instantiate gates to create a simple circuit.

In terms of testing nested unpacked structures, you would need to create a Verilog testbench that would instantiate this module and feed it different input values, and observe the output values to verify the logic correctness.
  
You can also create a top-level module that includes the gade module and the testbench, and connect the inputs and outputs to display the results, but this is beyond the scope of this explanation. It would require a more advanced Verilog implementation such as ModelSim, VCS, or an IDE that supports Verilog simulation. 
  
Remember to import your module in the appropriate testbench file. As of now, the testbench file would require a top-level module that instantiates your module and assigns the outputs to display the result.

Also, note that Verilog treats all inputs and outputs as single bits, not arrays or structures of bits, so if you want to represent multiple bits (like an 8-bit bus), you'd need to use a data type that can represent multiple bits. This will depend on the specifics of your testbench and simulation setup.  
  
I strongly recommend working with an IDE that supports simulation, like ModelSim or VCS, and learning more about Verilog's language constructs. These concepts are fundamental to Verilog design and simulation.
  
Note: Please replace the "#" character with the specific inertial delay required as per the requirements. If you have multiple delays, separate them using a comma. The above code assumes a single delay for simplicity. #(rise, fall) syntax is used for rise and fall time delays, but it assumes a single delay for both rise and fall if only one value is
