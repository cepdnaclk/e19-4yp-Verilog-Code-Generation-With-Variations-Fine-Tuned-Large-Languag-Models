```verilog
module full_adder(i1, i2, cin, sum, cout);
input i1, i2, cin;
output logic sum, cout;
assign sum = i1 ^ i2 ^ cin;
assign cout = (i1 & i2) | (cin & (i1 | i2));
endmodule
```

In the modified code, the output cout is declared as a logic variable. This helps to maintain compatibility with logic vectors and allows for the verification of full_adder.

Remember to always define the type of a signal with "wire" or "logic" beforehand. If you don't define the type, it defaults to wire, which makes Verilog be less explicit and more error prone. Using "logic" in explicit way helps to avoid such errors.

The logic of the code remains the same, it's just a change in the way outputs are declared.

Please note that in Verilog, "wire" can be replaced with "logic" to make the code more explicit. They both perform the same function, but "wire" is implicit and "logic" is explicit. Using "logic" is recommended for clarity and readability.

Lastly, when verifying the full adder with logic vectors, make sure that the output variables "sum" and "cout" are correctly asserted within the Verilog testbench. In this example, the testbench would need to generate inputs and check that the outputs match the expected values. This is not included in this code. Be sure to include it in any tests you intend to run on your full adder module.```verilog
module full_adder_tb();
    logic i1, i2, cin, sum, cout;
    full_adder FA(i1, i2, cin, sum, cout);
    initial begin
        i1 = 1'b0;
        i2 = 1'b0;
        cin = 1'b0;
        #5; // delay for a few cycles
        assert({sum, cout} == {1'b0, 1'b0})
            $display("PASS: 0 + 0 = 0 + 0");
        else 
            $display("FAIL: 0 + 0!= 0 + 0");

        i1 = 1'b0
