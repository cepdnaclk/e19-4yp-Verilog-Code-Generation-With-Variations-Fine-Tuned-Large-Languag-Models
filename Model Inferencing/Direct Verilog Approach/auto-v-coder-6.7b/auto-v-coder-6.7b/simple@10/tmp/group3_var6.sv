```verilog
module full_adder(i1, i2, cin, sum, cout);
input i1, i2, cin;
output sum, logic cout;
assign sum = i1 ^ i2 ^ cin;
assign cout = (i1 & i2) | (cin & (i1 | i2));
endmodule
```
This change only affects how the cout output is declared. It should work as expected, but it depends on whether the compiler supports the logic data type or not. If the compiler doesn't support logic, then you should use wire instead of logic. In this case, you should get an error since logic data type is not supported in SystemVerilog. Changing it to wire would look like this:

```verilog
module full_adder(i1, i2, cin, sum, cout);
input i1, i2, cin;
output sum, wire cout;
assign sum = i1 ^ i2 ^ cin;
assign cout = (i1 & i2) | (cin & (i1 | i2));
endmodule
```

This variation only changes the output type of the cout signal, but the behavior of the design should not change based on this change. The logic data type is typically supported by all Verilog and SystemVerilog compilers, but it is not universally supported, especially in older Verilog standards. It is generally not recommended to use logic data type unless you are sure that the compiler supports it. In general, you should stick to the wire data type for Verilog and SystemVerilog as it is more universally supported and has better compatibility with different types of Verilog designs. In some cases, using logic may have undefined results, especially in older Verilog versions, and should be avoided if possible.
