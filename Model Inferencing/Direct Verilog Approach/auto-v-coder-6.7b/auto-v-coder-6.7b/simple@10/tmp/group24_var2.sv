In this code, we have created a DFF module that implements a D flip-flop with an `and` operation. In the top module, we have set up a test to use a packed union as input to the DFF module. The test assigns random values to the input union at the positive edge of the clock. Note that the input to the DFF module is passed as a union of two 8-bit wide signals. This union is then assigned values of the two inputs at every positive clock edge causing the D flip-flop to operate on the latest values of a_in and b_in signals. This demonstrates the union handling in module ports in Verilog.

Please note that the above code assumes that the design has a clock signal named `clk`. The `posedge` keyword is used as the clock edge sensitivity for the flip-flop. If your design has a different name for the clock signal, replace `posedge clk` with the correct keyword.

Also, this code snippet assumes that you are using `always` construct to drive the reset signal. Be sure to correctly handle reset conditions in your design.
