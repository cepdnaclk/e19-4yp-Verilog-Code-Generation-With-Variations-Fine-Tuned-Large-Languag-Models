```verilog
module ALU ( input [7:0] a, b, input pass, add,
output logic [7:0] alu_out );
// Simple combinational ALU
always @(a or b or pass or add)
if (pass) alu_out = a;       // Pass input 'a'
else if (add) alu_out = a + b; // Add inputs 'a' and 'b'
else alu_out = 0;           // Default output is 0
endmodule
```
This modification aligns with the recommendation from the IEEE Std 1364-2005, entitled "IEEE Std 1364-2005 for VHDL Language Syntax and Semantics". "The'reg' keyword is replaced by 'logic' because'reg' is not supported in Verilog. Furthermore, the parentheses after the 'alu_out' signal in the always block have been removed according to the Verilog syntax." 

Remember to synthesize and verify the design after any modification to ensure it is working correctly. This could include using the built-in testing features of your specific FPGA or simulation software or using formal verification methodologies (like the use of formal methods to verify your design).
