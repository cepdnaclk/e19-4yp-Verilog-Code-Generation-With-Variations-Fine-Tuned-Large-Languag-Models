```verilog
module DFF (input logic a, b, output logic y);

    // Define a packed union for the inputs
    typedef struct packed {
        logic a;
        logic b;
    } Inputs;

    // Module port uses the union type
    input Inputs in;

    // Instantiate DFF
    DFF dut(.a(in.a),.b(in.b),.y(y));

endmodule
```
This code modifies the DFF instantiation to take a packed union of the logic inputs a and b. This is useful for testing union handling in module ports.

Note: The `struct packed` keyword is used to pack the structure into one bit, which means `logic a;` and `logic b;` will be packed into one bit. The `typedef` statement defines a new type `Inputs` that matches the structure. The input of the module is now of type `Inputs` and can be accessed as `in.a` and `in.b`. This union-based approach is useful for controlling all inputs together. It is also useful for using one bit to control multiple DFFs.

The `typedef` statement in the module header allows the use of `Inputs` as a type in the module itself. This allows the `in.a` and `in.b` syntax to be used to access the inputs.

The DFF module is instantiated with the union as input, and the output is connected directly to the output of the DFF. This allows the testing of the DFF in this context. The `DFF` instantiation is not necessary in this context and could be replaced with a normal DFF instantiation. However, it is included for completeness.```verilog
module DFF (input logic a, b, output logic y);
    DFF dut(.a(a),.b(b),.y(y));
endmodule
```
In this example, the DFF module is instantiated without a packed union. The module instantiation could be replaced with the original DFF module without the `typedef struct packed` and `Inputs` statements. This module instantiation would allow for the standard DFF behavior with a, b, and y directly connected.

Please note that union handling for module ports is not implemented in all platforms or simul
