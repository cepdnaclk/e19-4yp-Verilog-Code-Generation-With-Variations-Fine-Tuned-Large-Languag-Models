```verilog
module sw2led2_tb ();
reg [7:0] sw_tb;
wire [7:0] ld_tb;

sw2led2 dut (
.sw(sw_tb),
.ld(ld_tb)
);

initial begin
$monitor("sw = %b --> ld = %b",sw_tb,ld_tb);

// Test Case 1: Normal Case
sw_tb <= 8'b1010_1111;
#10;

// Test Case 2: Negative Case
sw_tb <= -8'b1010_1111;
#10;

$finish;
end
endmodule
```
In the modified code, a signed test case has been added to test the behaviour of the module when dealing with signed numbers. This test case, which evaluates the behaviour of the module when the input signal `sw` is a negative value, will give an expected output.

Remember to simulate this testbench with an appropriate ALU model (like the one provided in the base code) as the actual ALU is not defined in this example and hence, cannot be directly tested here. For a complete simulation, one needs to incorporate the ALU model along with the testbench.

Please note that ALU and modules are generally defined in separate files and connected before simulation. This is a simplified example and may need adjustments based on the actual model and test bench setup. 

For testing signed numbers in Verilog, make sure to use unsigned types to avoid undefined behaviour or overflow. This example uses 8-bit signed numbers and the test case could be adjusted for other data types and ranges as needed. 

Also, for testing other conditions, such as overflow, zero value, or carry out, you would need to adjust the test cases accordingly. This test bench is only demonstrating the concept of the module with signed numbers.

In general, you can use the testbench to test different scenarios and conditions to validate your design. It is an essential tool for verification and optimization of digital circuits. 

In addition to this, always run the testbench in a simulator where you can view the simulation waveforms and any errors or discrepancies that occur during the simulation. This can help in identifying any issues before they are deployed
