```verilog
module example3(Data, Clock, Reset, RegSum, Sum);
input Clock, Reset;
input [3:0] Data;
output [3:0] Sum, RegSum;
wire [3:0] Sum, RegSum;
wire [3:0] ld [3:0];
reg4 R1 (Sum, Clock, Reset, RegSum);
assign Sum = Data + RegSum;
endmodule
```
This variation does not affect the functionality of the original code, as the output data (Sum) is produced from the internal signals (RegSum) via the addition of Data (which is an input). However, it would be possible to use this modified code to test the wire-array compatibility, as the array dimensions are not used in the original code. 

Please note that wire and reg types have different functionalities in Verilog. A wire can be used in any part of your code where a continuous assignment is allowed. But reg is a register that can be driven by the data inputs or by the internal combinational logic. The register will keep its value even after the reset.

Regarding the wire-array compatibility, Verilog allows arrays of wire. The array names (`ld`) is used for simulation and simulation tools help in debugging.
  
However, please remember that the use of wire in Verilog is primarily for temporary variables in the design for intermediate results or interconnection of signals. Always use wire for inputs and outputs, and use reg when you need a register for the internal logic of a module. This is just one way of doing it and doesn't have to be the only way. 

The behavior of the original code is unaffected by this change, but this variation introduces a new dimension to the input/output signals, which may or may not affect the behavior of the code. 

Therefore, this variation is not intended to modify the behavior of the original code but rather to explore a new Verilog feature. It is advised to use the original behavior of the code without the wire array. 

And always ensure that your Verilog code is synthesizable and free from any type of errors before simulating it or implementing it. ###

Remember that changing the code this way might not result in a functional Verilog design, due to the inherent limitations of the
