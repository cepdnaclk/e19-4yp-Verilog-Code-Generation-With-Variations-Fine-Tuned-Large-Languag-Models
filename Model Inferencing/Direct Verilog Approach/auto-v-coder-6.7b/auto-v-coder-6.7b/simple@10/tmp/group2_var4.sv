```verilog
module test;
typedef struct packed {
    logic x;
    logic y;
    logic z;
} packed_struct;

wire a;
packed_struct s;
assign #25 a = 1;
always begin
    s.x = #10 a;
end
endmodule
```
In the new code, we define a packed structure (packed_struct) with the signals x, y, and z. We then modify the assignments to use the packed_struct instead of the reg declarations. The `#10` delay is still applied, but within the struct. This demonstrates how packed structures can be used in Verilog.
Note that `logic` is a keyword that allows for easy declaration of wires and registers. It is a four-state type that is typically used to prevent simulation errors from accidentally assigning a value to it before it is assigned, just like how it behaves in SystemVerilog. The `#10` delay is still applied, it is just applied to the assignment within the struct. 

Keep in mind that packed structures should only be used when there is no data type in the struct that can hold more than 1 bit. In this case, the structure would need to be expanded if the signals `x`, `y`, and `z` can hold more than 1 bit each. This is just an example to show how to use packed structures in Verilog.```verilog
module test;
typedef struct packed {
    logic [2:0] x;
    logic [2:0] y;
    logic [2:0] z;
} packed_struct;

wire a;
packed_struct s;
assign #25 a = 3;
always begin
    s.x = #10 a;
end
endmodule
```
In the modified code, the packed_struct now includes three registers instead of one. Each of them can hold a 3-bit value now, and you can assign up to 8 different values to them for testing purposes. The `#10` delay is applied to the assignment within the struct.

Again, this is just showing how packed structures can be used in Verilog, but keep in mind packed structures should be used judiciously and carefully since they can complicate veril
