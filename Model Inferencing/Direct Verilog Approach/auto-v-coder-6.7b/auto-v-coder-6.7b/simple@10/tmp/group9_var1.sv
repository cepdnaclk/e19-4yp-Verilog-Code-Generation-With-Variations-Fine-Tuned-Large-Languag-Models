```
module problem8(input [2:0] a_in, b_in, output [2:0] diff);
  typedef struct packed {
    bit [1:0] x;
    bit [1:0] y;
    bit [1:0] z;
  } packed_struct;

  packed_struct a;
  packed_struct b;
  packed_struct diff_out;

  assign a.x = a_in[2:1];
  assign a.y = a_in[0];
  assign a.z = a_in[0];

  assign b.x = b_in[2:1];
  assign b.y = b_in[0];
  assign b.z = b_in[0];

  assign diff_out.x = a.x - b.x;
  assign diff_out.y = a.y - b.y;
  assign diff_out.z = a.z - b.z;

  assign diff = {diff_out.x, diff_out.y, diff_out.z};
endmodule
```
In the example above, we have created a packed structure named `packed_struct`. The signals x, y, and z are included within this structure. We then declare two packed structure variables, `a` and `b`, and assign values to their fields based on the inputs `a_in` and `b_in`. 

Next, we calculate the difference of the respective fields of the two packed structures. These differences are assigned to the fields of a third packed structure `diff_out`.

Finally, the values of the fields of `diff_out` are concatenated into a 3-bit output for verification.

This code snippet demonstrates how packable structures can make writing and reading complicated logic easier, especially when dealing with structured data. It also shows the flexibility of using Verilog to represent different signals in a single wire/bus, making it more versatile for various tasks.### Note: 
The problem statement does not specify the exact behaviour in case of overflow or underflow, so this implementation assumes that overflow and underflow conditions do not occur. If they do, additional logic and assertions should be added to detect and handle these conditions.
