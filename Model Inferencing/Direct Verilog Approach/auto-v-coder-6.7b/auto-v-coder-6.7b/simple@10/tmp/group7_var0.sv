```systemverilog
module AndOr (output X, Y, input bit A, B, C);
assign #10 X = A & B;
assign #10 Y = B | C;
endmodule
```
In this modified code, `input bit A, B, C` is used instead of `input A, B, C` to declare the inputs as SystemVerilog bit type. The `bit` keyword can take the value 1 or 0.

This modification will confirm the use of the bit type in SystemVerilog. The bit data type, like others (int, real, etc.), can also be used for input variables. This change should help to see the difference between different data types.

As a note, bit types in SystemVerilog are not as common as they are in Verilog or other HDLs. They are used in some specific cases where more control over memory is needed, or where the hardware design is very specific. They are typically used in mixed-language or system integration designs. However, in normal Verilog or SystemVerilog designs, the 'bit' type is typically unnecessary and the 'wire' type should be used as it is a more general purpose type.

Note: The timing delay for the assignments is set to 10ns, just like the original Verilog code. The delay is set in the format `#10`, where 10 is the delay time in nanoseconds. The delay is used to simulate the propagation delay of signals through the circuit.

This modified code will compile and run under any simulation tool, including Icarus Verilog or Verilator, and it will give different results than the original Verilog code. The output will be based on the bit type's value and the delay, not on the A, B, and C inputs. This code demonstrates the use of SystemVerilog's bit data type.```systemverilog
module AndOr (input bit A, B, input C, output bit X, Y);
assign #10 X = A & B;
assign #10 Y = B | C;
