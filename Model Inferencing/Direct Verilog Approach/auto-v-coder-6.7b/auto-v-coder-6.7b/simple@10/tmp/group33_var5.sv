```verilog
module ha_1(s,ca,a,b); // Half Adder with gate delays
  input a,b; output s,ca;
  xor #(delay_struct.delay_1) (s,a,b);
  and #(delay_struct.delay_2) (ca,a,b);
endmodule

```
The modified code assumes that `delay_struct` is unpacked structure with signed members named `delay_1` and `delay_2`. These member values are to be replaced with appropriate delay values for your application. The delay parameters are not used in the module logic, they are used only for gate delays.

Please note that the delays could be any positive integer for modeling purposes and not necessarily real time delays. For such purposes, synthesis tools like Xilinx Vivado or Quartus can be used. 

In synthesis, Verilog delays are translated to the timing constraints of the physical technology used. Real delay values may vary for different physical devices and may also change with optimization parameters.

In your actual application, you can use an interface to connect `delay_struct` with the top module, or you can use a constant value if the delays are known and do not need to be modified.

Also, keep in mind that gate delays are generally a concept of gate-level modeling and Verilog doesn't have built-in support for them. You may need external tools for gate-level modeling if you are not using a simulator.

Remember to always carefully consider the trade-off between simulation speed and gate-level synthesis results for real-world applications. It could be a case of sacrificing simulation speed for better gate-level timing. This is one of the major trade-offs in SystemVerilog.

Please replace `delay_struct` with your actual structure type and member names.

Also, keep in mind that these delays are for gate level modeling, they may not be the same as delays at the output of a module. For example, if a module delay is 500ps but a gate has a delay of 1500ps, the gate-level delay will not be accurately reflected by the module delay. Be sure to take into consideration the specific delays you need for your application.```verilog
