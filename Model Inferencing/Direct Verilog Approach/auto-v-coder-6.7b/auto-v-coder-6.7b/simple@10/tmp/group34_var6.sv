```verilog
module wire_assign( input [15:0] in, input clk, output reg [15:0] out );
    always@(posedge clk)
    begin
      // assign out to in
      out = in;
    end
endmodule
```
In the modified code, we changed the input to an array of 16-bit width and the output to be a 16-bit width array as well. Inside the always block, we are using the posedge of the clock to copy the values from the input array to the output array. This is a basic example of a clocked process, which updates the output array based on the input array at the rising edge of the clock.

It's important to note that while Verilog supports wildcard indexing for associative arrays and `reg` data types, it doesn't support direct assignment from a wildcard indexed array. Therefore, the inside operator (`[]`) is required to access specific elements of a variable (in this case, the output array `out`).

Please note that this is just a basic example and the syntax may change depending on the specifics of the tool or simulator being used.

Also, it's important to note that the `out` is defined as type `reg` which is a variable that can be used to write into but cannot be written from outside the module. This is to prevent any external signals from driving `out`. If you wish to allow external changes to `out`, you would need to remove the `reg` keyword and use a signal instead.

Another important point to keep in mind is that Verilog doesn't support arrays of signals; you can't use `reg` variable inside a module to drive the outputs of that module. You must use each individual output port of the module, or a signal with an appropriate name, to drive each output. 

If you want to update an array of signals synchronously, it would be better to use an array of `reg` variables, and update each one in a `always` block with a `posedge` or `negedge` statement. 

If you are working with a synthesis tool, you would need to specify any external port that can drive `out` as part of the module definition, or use a `reg` variable to hold the output and drive
