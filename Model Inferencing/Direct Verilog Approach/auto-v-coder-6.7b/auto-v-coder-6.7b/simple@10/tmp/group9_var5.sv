```verilog
module Problem8(input [3:0] a, b, output [3:0] diff);
  // Packed structure declaration
  typedef struct packed {
    bit [3:0] x;
    bit [3:0] y;
    bit [3:0] z;
  } packed_struct;

  packed_struct ps; // Instantiate packed structure

  // Assign inputs to packed structure members
  always @ (posedge a or posedge b) begin
    ps.x = a;
    ps.y = b;
  end

  // Subtract b from a to get the difference
  assign diff = ps.x - ps.y;
endmodule
```
In this modified code, a packed structure is defined and used to hold the input signals a and b. The packed structure members are assigned the values of the signals immediately after they are received. The difference between the signals a and b is then calculated and assigned to the diff output. This demonstrates how packed structures can be used to handle multiple signals in a compact and efficient manner. Note that the order of the signals in the structure declaration does not affect the order in which they are assigned in the always block.
