```verilog
module FourFlopsStructL #(parameter DClk = 2, DBuf = 1)
(output logic [3:0] Q, input byte [3:0] D, input Ena, Clk);
wire logic[3:0] QWire;
localparam DTot = DBuf + DClk;
DFF DReg[3:0] (.Q(QWire),.D(D),.Clk(Clk));
assign #DTot Q = (Ena==1'b1)? QWire : 'bz;
endmodule
```

The above modification changes the module so that the input D from byte to byte [3:0] and also changes the output Q to logic [3:0] to test byte-type vector compatibility. Since byte is a synonym for integer, it is compatible with the input D and output Q. Testing this will allow the module to accept byte-type vectors as inputs and output logic-type vectors when Ena is high.

Please note that this modification might not work in all synthesizers or with specific simulators, as the logic and byte types are not universally compatible. The modification will not work well with all synthesis tools. It is only provided for educational purposes to illustrate how the code can be modified to accommodate a broader range of inputs and outputs. ### Conclusion:

This approach should work in many cases considering the wide range of Verilog features, but in some specific scenarios, it may not work as expected or may work differently according to the specific tool being used. Hence, always test your design thoroughly, considering the limitations and constraints of each tool, to ensure the compatibility and behavior of your design.```verilog
