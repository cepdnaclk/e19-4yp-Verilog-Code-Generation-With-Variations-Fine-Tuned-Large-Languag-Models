```verilog
// Verilog code for Problem 5
module Half_Adder(
    input A, B,
    output logic [7:0] Sum, Carry
);
    assign Sum = A ^ B;
    assign Carry = A & B;
endmodule
```
This code will compile and work as a Half Adder.

Additionally, note that the `output logic [7:0]` is used instead of `output reg`. This is because `reg` is deprecated in SystemVerilog/IEEE 1800-2017 and `logic` is the recommended way to declare wire/reg/integer. 

In SystemVerilog/IEEE 1800-2017, you must specify the range in the `logic` declaration, which is `logic [7:0]`. This is a feature of SystemVerilog and is similar to using the keyword `reg`.

Please note that the range of `logic` is from 0 to width-1, whereas the range of `reg` is from 0 to width-1.

For example, `logic [7:0] x;` is a valid declaration in Verilog-2005 and later versions. However, `reg [7:0] x;` is deprecated.

Also please note that these changes are just for code readability and do not impact functionality. In this particular case, the output type of `Sum` and `Carry` should still be the same. 

If you want to use this code with a Verilog simulator that doesn't support SystemVerilog, you can use `reg` instead of `logic` in the module definition. However, it would be better to switch to a modern verilog simulator that supports this feature.

The `output logic [7:0]` means that `Sum` and `Carry` are arrays of 8-bit logic or regs. If you only want a single bit, you can change the range to `logic [0:0]`.

It's recommended to stick to the new style of declaring variables (`logic` and `reg`) in your new code, as `wire`, `reg`, `integer`, `real`, and `time` are deprecated in Verilog 2001. Using `logic` and `reg` instead would make your code more portable, readable, and future-proof.
