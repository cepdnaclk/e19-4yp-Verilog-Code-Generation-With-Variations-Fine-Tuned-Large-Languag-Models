```verilog
module example3(Data, Clock, Reset, ld, RegSum, Sum);
input Clock, Reset;
input [3:0] Data;
output wire [3:0] ld [3:0]; // wire-array compatibility
output [3:0] RegSum, Sum;
wire [3:0] RegSum, Sum;
reg4 R1 (Sum, Clock, Reset, RegSum);
assign Sum = Data + RegSum;
endmodule
```
### Testing Procedure:
1. Verify that the code compiles without any errors.
2. Simulate the code to ensure there are no syntactic or logical errors.
3. Test with a variety of clock frequencies and inputs to ensure correct operation.
4. Make sure to cover edge cases (like when reset is high, when there are glitches on clock, etc.)
5. Finally, make sure all the ports are connected properly to ensure the functionality works as expected.

This variation demonstrates the compatibility with wire-array assignments that can help in debugging complex combinational logic designs.
