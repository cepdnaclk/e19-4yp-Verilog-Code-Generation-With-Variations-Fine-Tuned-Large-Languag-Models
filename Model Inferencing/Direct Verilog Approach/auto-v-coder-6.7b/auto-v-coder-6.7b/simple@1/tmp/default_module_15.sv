In this code, we added an additional test case in the testbench module that deals specifically with signed integers. The input to the DUT (Device Under Test) is modified to be a signed 8-bit binary number. The output of the DUT is compared with the input for the two cases. The `$monitor` is used to display the input and output at the current time. `$finish` is used to end the simulation. In the `if` condition, `assert` is used to check if the output is equal to the input. If it's not equal, an error message is printed. This can help identify any discrepancies or errors in the output. Finally, a message is printed to indicate that the test is complete. `$finish` is used to end the simulation.

The `#10;` after each `sw` assignment is to wait for the values to propagate to the DUT. Without this wait, the `#10;` makes sure that both the input and output have been updated before we check them. 

This code does not require any changes to the Verilog code to make it work, as the `assign` statement in the original Verilog code does not affect the signed or unsigned behavior of the circuit.

Note: This is a basic example and may vary based on the actual implementation of the DUT in the design. For example, there may be specific ways to handle signed and unsigned numbers in the DUT's design depending on the specific behavior required. In this case, the `assign` statement simply replicates the input to the output, which is not technically the expected behavior of the Verilog model. It is more representative of the actual behavior of the given design.

This testbench adds extra functionality to evaluate the signed integer handling but it does not affect the verilog code in any significant way. The `assign` statement in the original verilog code still replicates the input onto the output. If the specific behavior for signed numbers is required, the solution would be to implement such rules in the actual Verilog code itself. 

Also, the testbench code here is quite basic and might not cover edge cases or the exact behavior of a Verilog design. For more sophisticated testing, such as checking for specific expected outputs for different input combinations, more complex test cases, or the ability to automatically generate input patterns, a fuller testbench structure would be more appropriate. However, this would require additional Verilog code and possibly separate testbench code. The original code is provided to demonstrate the functionality of the `assign` statement and how Verilog models behave.
