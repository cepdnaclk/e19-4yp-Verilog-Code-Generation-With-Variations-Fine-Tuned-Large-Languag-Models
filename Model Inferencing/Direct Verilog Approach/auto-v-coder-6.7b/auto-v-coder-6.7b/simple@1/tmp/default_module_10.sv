module tst_alu4();
  reg [3:0]a,b; reg[1:0] f; reg cci; logic[3:0]d; logic co;
  alu_4 aa(d,co,a,b,f,cci); // Instantiate ALU
  initial begin cci=1'b0; f=2'b00; a=4'h0; b=4'h0; #30 $stop; end // Initialize & stop
  always begin // Apply stimulus with #3 delay
  end
  initial $monitor($time, " cci = %b, a= %h,b = %h,f = %b,d =%h,co= %b ",cci,a,b,f,d,co); // Use %h
endmodule
```
In this code, the output variable d is changed from wire to logic. The reason for this change is to test logic vector compatibility.

The ALU-4 Verilog module is assumed to be defined elsewhere. The logic co and d are assigned to the outputs of the ALU-4 module. The f, cci, a, and b inputs are all 0 as they are declared as reg. #30 $stop; is a delay and stop command which will stop simulation after 30 time units. The $monitor command will print out the values of cci, a, b, f, d, and co every clock cycle to the simulation output. The $time is the simulation time.

If the ALU-4 design performs the operation as expected, and the output d corresponds to the expected result, the simulation will pass. If d is not as expected, then the ALU-4 design needs to be debugged. If the co flag does not correspond to the expected logical carry out from the ALU operation, then the logic in the ALU-4 module needs to be debugged. 

Please note that it's important to always run a full simulation to ensure the design functions correctly. This code is a basic test that validates the input and output of the ALU. If it passes, the ALU is likely correct. If it fails, the ALU needs to be debugged. This is just a simple test to demonstrate verification. The testbench should be extended with more thorough tests to ensure the ALU works as intended.
