```
module ALU (output logic [3:0] Result, input logic [3:0] ArgA, ArgB, input Clk);
specify
    specparam tRise = 5, tFall = 4;
    (Clk *> Result) = (tRise, tFall);
endspecify

The changes are made to change the variable type from `input[31:0]` to `input logic [3:0]`, this will allow us to test the behavior of the ALU with signed arithmetic operations. This change will help validate the functionality of the ALU in a more precise manner. Please note that the `input` part of the port declaration is changed from `input[31:0]` to `input logic [3:0]`. Also, the output port declaration is changed from `output[31:0]` to `output logic [3:0]`.

The `logic` type is similar to a `reg` with the difference that it can be initialized with any value and the simulation tool will infer the direction based on the value.

Please remember to use this change wisely considering the fact that there is no standard way to define signed numbers in Verilog. This instruction is meant to test the behavior of the ALU with signed numbers and is not meant to be used in hardware designs. For hardware, use `reg` or `wire` instead of `logic` for input and output ports. In a real hardware design, use a signed arithmetic on the logic of the hardware instead of the model.

Also, make sure that ArgA, ArgB, and Result are declared as signed. You may need to adjust the model to reflect the intended behavior of the ALU.```verilog
module ALU (output reg [3:0] Result, input reg [3:0] ArgA, ArgB, input Clk);
specify
    specparam tRise = 5, tFall = 4;
    (Clk *> Result) = (tRise, tFall);
endspecify
endmodule
```

Just note that the Result variable must be a `reg` type variable and ArgA and ArgB should be of `reg` type as well. The ALU operation is not modified in the code, the only change is in the type of the inputs and outputs. In a real hardware design, the ALU operation would be performed using a combination of the input data and the control signals. The Result will be updated at every clock edge. However, if you try to use this code in hardware simulation, the result may not be what you expect because of the asynchronous nature of the `Clk *> Result`. This instruction is meant to be used for testing purposes only in a simulation environment.<API_RUN_STOP>
