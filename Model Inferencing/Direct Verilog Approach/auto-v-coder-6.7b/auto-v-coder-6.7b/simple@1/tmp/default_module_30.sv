```verilog
module netdelay1(x,y);
input x;
output y;
wire #(2,1) nn; // Declare wire 'nn' with rise=2, fall=1 delay
not (nn,x); // Assign NOT(x) to 'nn' (takes effect after rise/fall delay)
assign y=nn; // Assign 'nn' to 'y' (direct assignment)
endmodule
```

This single-line Verilog code can be used to create a net delay of 2ns for input x and output y. The output y will be assigned the result of NOT(x) after 1ns of rise and 1ns of fall. The rise and fall times can be adjusted according to specific requirements.

However, let's create a single-wire, 32-bit structure for the output y. Here's a modification of the code for that:

```verilog
module netdelay1(x,y);
input x;
output [31:0] y; // Declare the output as a 32-bit wide packed array
wire [31:0] nn; // Declare a 32-bit wide wire
for(i=0; i<32; i++) begin // Create a for-loop to assign each field of the wire
  not (nn[i],x); // Assign NOT(x) to each of the 32 fields 
end
assign y=nn; // Assign 'nn' to 'y' (direct assignment)
endmodule
```

This code creates a 32-bit structure for the output y and then a NOT operation is applied to each bit of x, creating the effect of a rising and falling delay of 2ns and 1ns, respectively. 

Remember that the rise and fall times are specified in the not() function, not in the delay() function. Also, the rise and fall delay times in not() function represents the delay relative to 'x', not the output 'y'. It can be adjusted according to specific requirements.

The delay() function is used to set the initial delay of the module, which is not directly related to the output 'y'. However, in this case, as 'y' is not directly related to any delay, it is not needed. If needed, separate delay is needed and can be added after the not() operation as below:

```verilog
module netdelay1(x,y);
input x;
output [31:0] y;
wire [31:0] nn;
for(i=0; i<31; i++) begin
  not (nn[i],x); 
end
assign #(2,1) y=nn; // Assign 'nn' to 'y' with rise=2, fall=1 delay
endmodule
```
In this case, the assignment to 'y' will happen after 2ns of rising and 1ns of falling delay. This is independent of the NOT operation delays on the individual fields of 'nn'. As such, these delays can be adjusted separately from the delays applied to the individual fields on 'nn'.
