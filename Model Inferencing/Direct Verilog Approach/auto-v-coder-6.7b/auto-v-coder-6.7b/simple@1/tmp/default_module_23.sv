```verilog
module FourFlopsStructL #(parameter DClk = 2, DBuf = 1)
(output byte[3:0] Q, input byte[3:0] D, input Ena, Clk);
wire byte[3:0] QWire;
localparam DTot = DBuf + DClk;
DFF DReg[3:0] (.Q(QWire),.D(D),.Clk(Clk));
assign #DTot Q = (Ena==1'b1)? QWire : 'bz;
endmodule
```

In this modified code, the input vector from byte is defined to the module. This allows the module to take byte-type vectors as input. However, please note that this code does not cover the full range of Verilog or SystemVerilog vector-type compatibility. This is just a basic byte-type input vector demonstration. The actual compatibility of byte type with SystemVerilog and Verilog may be slightly different depending on the specific tool or synthesis tool used. This is just an example to showcase the flexibility of SystemVerilog and Verilog in handling vector type definitions.### Note:

Please ensure to have the byte vector compatibility supported by your specific tool or synthesis tool. This might vary depending on the standard being used, the version of the tool, and the specific features of your specific tool. Be sure to use a synthesis tool that supports this feature. 

If byte type is not supported, you will need to use logic type vectors or generate a separate module for each bit of the vector.

This is more of a feature that is supported by some tools or extensions and not universally available. Hence, it's recommended to check the specific tool documentation or support forum for specific details.

Also, it should be noted that this might not be a good approach to use byte in real-world applications due to limitations related to byte data representation. However, this question is somewhat out of scope for byte data representation and the given code is to illustrate the flexibility of using byte type as the input vector.

Also, using byte type is not a recommended practice in modern systems design due to the need of considering endianness, word size, and other considerations while inter-communicating with different systems. Verilog and SystemVerilog provide byte, shortint, int, longint, etc., which are more suitable for hardware design, especially when dealing with bit streams.```verilog
