```verilog
module full_adder(i1, i2, cin, sum, cout);
input i1, i2, cin;
output sum, logic cout;
assign sum = i1 ^ i2 ^ cin;
assign cout = (i1 & i2) | (cin & (i1 | i2));
endmodule
```
Note: This modification will only work with tools that support the logic type. Many tools, including Xilinx ISE, Synopsys VCS, and Mentor Graphics Questa, support the logic type. However, a logic type is not common in other type of hardware description languages and may not work with all Verilog tools. The logic type is also not standard Verilog syntax and may not be compatible with all other types of hardware description languages, including IEEE 1364-2001. If you're working on a project that is using a different DDL (Data Definition Language), you might need to adjust your types accordingly.

Also, keep in mind that logic is used in Verilog to represent logic values (1 or 0), but might not be the most appropriate choice for all types of hardware designs. In general, Verilog is a simple and expressive language for hardware description, but many more advanced and specialized languages are available for more complex designs. That's also why the logic type in Verilog isn't usually used for combinational logic: it's better to describe combinational logic using wire, reg, or logic type in the correct hardware description language (like VHDL). If using Verilog for hardware design, logic may not be the most appropriate type, but it's used here because of its broad compatibility.

In summary, the logic type is not the most suitable type for combinational logic in Verilog, but it's used here for the purpose of this example to demonstrate logic-vector compatibility. For more complex designs, you may need to use a more specific type of hardware description language.```verilog
module full_adder(i1, i2, cin, sum, cout);
input i1, i2, cin;
output logic [1:0] sum;
output logic cout;
assign sum = {i1 ^ i2 ^ cin, i1 & i2 | cin & (i1 | i2)};
endmodule

If youâ€™re designing for a specific type of hardware, you should choose the appropriate type of hardware description language that fits your needs. This is a simple example, so you may not need all the features of a more complex design language.![](https://i.imgur.com/ZRhFJ4W.png)
For this project you need to consider your specific design and choose the most suitable hardware description language that is appropriate for your requirements. A simple logic type for verification is used only, other hardware description languages are used for production level design.<API_RUN_START>```verilog
