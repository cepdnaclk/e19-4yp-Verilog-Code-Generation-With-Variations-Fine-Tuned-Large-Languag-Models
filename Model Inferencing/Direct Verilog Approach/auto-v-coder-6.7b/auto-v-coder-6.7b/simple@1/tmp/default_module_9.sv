```verilog
typedef struct packed {
  bit x;
  bit y;
  bit z;
} packed_sig;

module Problem8(input packed_sig a, b, output packed_sig diff);
  assign diff = a - b;
endmodule
```
In the above code, `packed_sig` is a packed structure declaration with three bits named `x`, `y`, and `z`. The input `a`, `b`, and output `diff` are declared of this type. To test the packed structure handling, you can initialize values to the signals inside the `packed_sig` type and perform arithmetic operations on them.

This code will perform bit-wise subtraction operation on `a.x` and `b.x`, `a.y` and `b.y`, `a.z` and `b.z` and will place the results in the `diff` structure. You can modify the `x`, `y`, and `z` bits of `a` and `b` inside the module to verify the correctness of the subtraction.

Please note that Verilog does not support bitwise arithmetic on structs, so this example may not work as expected. It is only provided to illustrate packed structure handling in Verilog and is not actual hardware logic.

This test code is not synthesizable in a real hardware design because packed structures are not directly supported in Verilog hardware description language. This is a feature that is limited to software and some synthesizers have limited support for packed structures in hardware designs. This was added in SystemVerilog, which is a superset of Verilog. If you were to use SystemVerilog, your code would look like the same code shown above.```verilog
typedef struct packed {
  bit x;
  bit y;
  bit z;
} packed_sig;

module Problem8(input packed_sig a, b, output packed_sig diff);
  assign diff = {a.x - b.x, a.y - b.y, a.z - b.z};
endmodule
```

Also, make sure that your testbench code should be written in SystemVerilog, as Verilog does not support packed structures. 

If you were to implement this in a hardware design, the code would look similar to the SystemVerilog version, but use bitwise arithmetic operations such as `&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, etc., to carry out the operations. The actual bit manipulation will depend on the exact functionality you want to implement.```verilog
module Problem8(input a, b, output diff);
  assign diff = a - b;
endmodule
```

The above code is a simple Verilog module that performs subtraction. It assumes that the inputs `a` and `b` are single bits (as there are no other signals within the `packed_sig` structure), and the output `diff` is also a single bit. Since Verilog does not natively support operations between structs, the code is limited to bit-related operations.

Also, keep in mind that Verilog does not perform arithmetic on structs directly, so this code is just a demonstration of how to use structs in Verilog and should not be synthesizable as hardware. If you're looking to synthesize this into a real hardware design, you should use a language that supports hardware description such as SystemVerilog or VHDL.!#$

The synthesizable version would depend on the specific functionality you want the hardware to perform, and may be significantly different from this demonstration of bitwise operations.```verilog
module Problem8(input a, b, output diff);
  assign diff = a - b;
endmodule
```

This code is the traditional subtraction operation, but it assumes that you're using a single bit input `a` and `b` and an output `diff`. The actual hardware implementation would depend on the specific requirements of the system you're designing and would likely need to be adjusted accordingly.```verilog
module Problem8(input [3:0] a, b, output [3:0] diff);
  assign diff = a - b;
endmodule
```

This code is the subtraction operation between two 4-bit inputs `a` and `b`, with a 4-bit output `diff`. Again, the actual hardware implementation will depend on the specific requirements of the system you're designing and would need to be adjusted accordingly.```verilog
module Problem8(input [3:0] a, b, output [3:0] diff);
  assign diff = a - b;
endmodule
```

module Problem8(input [3:0] a, b, output [3:0] diff);
  assign diff = a - b;
endmodule
```

This is merely a verification and not actual hardware logic. Remember, the synthesized logic will depend on the specific hardware constraints and needs of the system under design.```verilog
module Problem8(input [3:0] a, b, output reg [3:0] diff);
  assign diff = a - b;
endmodule
```

This is a modification of the original code to include the `reg` keyword in the output `diff`. The `reg` keyword is used to declare a register that can be read and written by the module; it has similar functionality to the `wire` keyword but with a storage capability. Note that this is a synthesizable design and the output `diff` would be a 4-bit register that can be read and written in the hardware. This code is a simple illustration and actual hardware design might require more complex functionality and constraints.
