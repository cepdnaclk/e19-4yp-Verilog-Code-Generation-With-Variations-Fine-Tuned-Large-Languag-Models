// Verilog code for Problem 4
module XOR_Gate(
    input logic [1:0] A [0:3],
    output logic [1:0] Y [0:3]
);
    always @(*) begin
        for(int i = 0; i < 4; i++) begin
            Y[i] = A[i] ^ {1'b0, A[i][0]};
        end
    end
endmodule
```

This code will create a multi-dimensional XOR gate with 4 input and 4 output signals. In this modified code, each input is a 1D logic-vector and Y is also a 1D logic-vector array, handling multi-dimensional inputs and outputs.

The code uses the inside operator (`^`) with a fixed 4D range to test multi-dimensional array handling. The result is assigned to the i-th element of the output array `Y`. The `always @(*)` block ensures that the output array `Y` updates whenever the input array `A` changes.

Please note that `{1'b0, A[i][0]}` is used to ensure that both `A[i]` and `{1'b0, A[i][0]}` are 2-bit vectors, which simplifies the XOR operation. If `A[i]` was already a 2-bit vector, `{1'b0, A[i][0]}` would be equivalent to `A[i]`. However, if `A[i]` was a single bit, `{1'b0, A[i][0]}` would be a 2-bit vector with the first bit set to 0 and the second bit set to the value of `A[i]`. This would allow for more complex operations on multi-dimensional arrays.

Please also note that in Verilog, packed arrays are indexed from 0 to size-1. So the range for the index is 0 to 3.

This code will be synthesizable with any FPGA synthesis tools, including Verilog, using the IEEE Std 1364-2001 (which also includes SystemVerilog) standard. 

Also note that the Verilog code provided here is a simple example and does not consider specific requirements like data width, clocking, etc. in an actual Verilog module. 

Variations of this problem can be designed based on the specific requirement of the problem and the tool used for synthesis. For example, the code may need to be modified when dealing with a different data width, or when using a different tool, etc.
 
This code provides a solution that uses the XOR operation on multi-dimensional signal arrays and also demonstrates the usage of the inside operator for multi-dimensional arrays. As such, it can be used as a starting point for other problems and can be modified according to the specific requirements.
  
Remember to include test bench code to verify the functionality of the module. 

This code is not suitable for synthesizing directly because it's very basic, and it assumes that the synthesis tool/method being used can handle multi-dimensional arrays. Some synthesis tools may not be capable of handing such complex operations. 

It's recommended to use a high-level synthesis (HLS) tool for this kind of tasks, which can handle multi-dimensional arrays and other complex operations in synthesis processes. This would provide a more robust and scalable solution.```verilog
