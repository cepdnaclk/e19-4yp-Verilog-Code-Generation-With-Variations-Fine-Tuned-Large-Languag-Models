module top;
  SchedDelayA inst[string];

  initial begin
    inst["inst1"] = new();

In the code above, a class `SchedDelayA` is used to define the module `SchedDelayA`. This class has two `rand` variables `a` and `b`, which are instantiated in the constructor method `new()`. The function `print_status()` is used to display the current status of `a` and `b` after each change in any of them.

In the `top` module, an associative array `inst` is used to store multiple instances of `SchedDelayA`. The `new()` method of `SchedDelayA` is called to create a new instance and then `print_status()` is called to display initial status. Then after 1ns, `print_status()` is called again to display status after update.

Please note that this code may not behave as expected if `a` and `b` are not random variables, since they are not changing automatically. This example is just to demonstrate how to create a class handle and how to use associative array to handle multiple instances of a class. In real-world application, you might need to use synchronous processes or other mechanisms to make `a` and `b` change over time.  

Also, the code does not include testbenches or clocking, which is essential to see the changes over time. This is just for illustration purposes. 

Remember to declare `a` and `b` as `rand` or `randc` in a class declaration if they can take on random values during simulation. If `a` and `b` are always the same, the class definition is not needed and the original base Verilog code can be used.<API_RUN_STOP>
