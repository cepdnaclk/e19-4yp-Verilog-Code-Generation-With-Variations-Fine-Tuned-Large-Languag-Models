```verilog
module AndOr (output logic X, Y, input bit A, B, C);
assign #10 X = A & B;
assign #10 Y = B | C;
endmodule
```

In SystemVerilog, bit type can be used for single bit signals, and it can be used in similar ways as a regular wire, but with some added features when used with procedural assignments. Bit type signals are also more efficient in simulation, but they can't be connected directly to the input and output ports of a module, as bit type signals can't be driven. They can only be driven by procedural assignments.

The #10 delay is just for illustration, you can adjust it according to your requirement.

To use bit type signals in a module, you must have a VHDL-like syntax where the input and output ports are declared with the `input bit` and `output logic` types respectively. The `logic` is a keyword in VHDL that declares an output or inout signal. The `bit` is a keyword for bit wide signal.

This code will provide the same logic as the original, but with the input and output signals declared using bit types, which allows usage in procedural assignments in simulation. Please consider this for simulation, not for synthesis, as bit types are not supported in synthesis. 

NOTE: This code should not be used in synthesis for any real hardware design. The input and output ports of a module in Verilog/SystemVerilog should be declared using wire or reg keywords to be compatible with any hardware synthesis tools. The bit type is mainly used in simulation, to make the Verilog code more efficient, but it is not suited for this purpose in hardware design. In hardware, you would use the reg/wire keywords to declare the input and output ports of a module.```verilog
module AndOr (output reg X, Y, input wire A, B, C);
assign #10 X = A & B;
assign #10 Y = B | C;
endmodule
