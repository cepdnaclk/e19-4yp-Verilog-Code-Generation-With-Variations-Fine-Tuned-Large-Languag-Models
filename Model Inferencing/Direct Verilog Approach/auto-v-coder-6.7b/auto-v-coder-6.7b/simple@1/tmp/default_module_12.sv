```verilog
module Problem1(input logic [3:0] a, b, output logic [3:0] sum);
  assign sum = a + b;
endmodule
```

This modified code declares the input and output ports in SystemVerilog style, using the logic type for compatibility. This modification is necessary to pass the test in a Verilog-compatible environment. 

**Note:** The SystemVerilog keywords (reg, logic, etc.) are not commonly used in Verilog code, but to maintain compatibility with such a coding environment, these are used in this example.

This modified code will pass the test if you are using a Verilog-compatible simulator with the following testbench:

```verilog
module problem1_tb();
  logic [3:0] a, b;
  logic [3:0] sum;
  
  Problem1 uut (
   .a(a),
   .b(b),
   .sum(sum)
  );
  
  initial begin
    a = 4'b1010;
    b = 4'b1100;
    #10
    $display("Sum = %b", sum); // This should print "Sum = 1010"
  end
endmodule
```

This is a simple testbench that initializes the inputs a and b, then after 10 time units checks the output sum, which should be 1010 (in binary). The display statement will print the binary value of sum. Please replace `uut` with the instantiated module name in your code.

Remember that for a full equivalence test in real SystemVerilog simulators, the code should be in a file with the extension ".sv" instead of ".v". Also, for real hardware, you'd replace the "4'b1010" and "4'b1100" with hexadecimal values, or even better, binary numbers. For example, to initialize a to binary 1010 and b to binary 1100, you'd do `a = 4'b1010; b = 4'b1100;`. In this case, the "#10" is also not necessary, since we are not delaying the test to simulate the propagation delay of the logic gates. If it were a real hardware design, you might need to delay to take into consideration the propagation delay of the gates.
