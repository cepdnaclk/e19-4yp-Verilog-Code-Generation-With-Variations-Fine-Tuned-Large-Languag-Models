```verilog
// Define structure
struct packed {
  logic x1;
  logic x2;
  logic x3;
  logic x4;
} x;

// Define parameters for unpacked struct
parameter bit [3:0] in = 'b0110;
parameter bit [3:0] in2 = 'b1111;

module par(x, parity, all_ones);
input struct packed {
  logic x1;
  logic x2;
  logic x3;
  logic x4;
} x;
output parity, all_ones;
assign parity = ^x;
assign all_ones = &x;
endmodule

//Instantiate module with unpacked struct parameters
par p1(x, parity1, all_ones1);
```

In this example, the packed `struct` type is defined with four logic fields (`x1`, `x2`, `x3`, `x4`). Then, we define two parameters with unpacked struct type. The first parameter is `'b0110`, and the second parameter is `'b1111`.

The module is instantiated with the unpacked struct parameters. 

The unpacked struct is used for parameters `in` and `in2` and unpacked struct fields `x1` through `x4` are assigned values from the respective parameter values. 

Then, the module `par` is instantiated with the unpacked struct `x` and the output `parity`, `all_ones` signals are connected to `parity1`, `all_ones1`. 

The `^x` and `&x` operations are applied to the unpacked struct `x` and the result is assigned to `parity1` and `all_ones1` respectively.

This variation code tests the operations on the structure-based logic operations and the unpacked struct parameter in a simpler and direct way. We can also apply these operations on more complex structures and parameters.```

This code is a simple example for understanding the structure-based logic operation and unpacked struct in Verilog. More complex operations and structures can be applied according to the specific requirements.```

NOTE: Be careful with unpacked structs as they can cause issues in some tools if not handled carefully. For example, some tools might not support unpacked structs as part of unpacked arrays. However, in Verilog, unpacked structs can be used within packed arrays or other types, making them a powerful feature for designing complex systems.```

This example also provides a basic understanding of the Verilog language and its capabilities. It's always advised to consider the limitations and tools support when designing complex Verilog designs.``````verilog
