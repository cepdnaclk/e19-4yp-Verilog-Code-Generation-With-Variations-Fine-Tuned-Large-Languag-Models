```verilog
module func1(x1, x2, x3, f);
input logic x1, x2, x3;
output logic signed [1:0] f;
assign f = {(~x1 & ~x2 & x3), (~x1 & x2 & ~x3), (x1 & ~x2 & x3), (x1 & x2 & ~x3)};
endmodule
```
We are using 2-bit signed vector to allow two possible outputs: 0 (if all inputs are false or all inputs are true) or 1 (if all inputs are true or all inputs are false). This is a simple way to use Verilog's logic to calculate truth tables of multiple inputs.

Please note, this code assumes that the inputs `x1`, `x2`, `x3` are 1-bit logic signals. If they are larger vectors, additional adjustment may be necessary.

Also, please replace your test bench as the original code will not work with signed logic types. You need to use $signed function to convert from 0 to 1 in Verilog to signed integer values. Please see the modified test bench below:

```verilog
module tb_func1;
logic x1, x2, x3;
logic signed [1:0] f;

func1 uut(x1, x2, x3, f);

initial begin
    x1 = 1'b0;
    x2 = 1'b0;
    x3 = 1'b0;
    #1;  // Wait for one time unit
    assert ($signed(f) == 2'b0) else $error("Test Failed: x1=%b, x2=%b, x3=%b", x1, x2, x3);
    
    x1 = 1'b0;
    x2 = 1'b0;
    x3 = 1'b1;
    #1;
    assert ($signed(f) == 2'b0) else $error("Test Failed: x1=%b, x2=%b, x3=%b", x1, x2, x3);
    
    // Add more test cases...

    $finish;
end
endmodule
```
Remember to compile and run with the Verilog compiler. If the test case passes, it verifies that the function and logic is working as it should, if not, it will show an error message.

You can also use these test cases to test other possible cases. Just replace the test cases as per your requirement. If your function has more inputs or more outputs, you might want to adjust the test bench accordingly.
