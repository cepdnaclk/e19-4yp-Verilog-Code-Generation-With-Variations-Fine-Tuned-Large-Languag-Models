This code modifies the given base code to generate four intermediate signals representing four possible combinations of 'a' and 'b' with 'c' and 'd'. It then utilizes these intermediate signals to generate the output signal 'g'. The use of intermediate signals is to avoid nested operation, increasing the readability and maintainability of the code. As per the initial request, we use an initial block inside the task to initialize the intermediate signals with an inside expression using a function call in the index.

Remember, this code will not generate the exact same gate behavior as before, due to the addition of an AND gate between 'a' and 'c' and another between 'b' and 'd'. This is to demonstrate the use of multiple intermediate signals. The correct behavior will depend on the actual problem at hand and the specific logic design requirements. The provided code is a simple example of logic design in verilog, and may not always be the most efficient solution for a specific problem. It is often better to use hardware synthesis tools and verify the design using formal verification to evaluate and optimize it.

Finally, keep in mind that Verilog is a hardware description language, it is used to describe the behavior of digital logic. Its use of continuous assignments may not necessarily correspond to the behavior of physical digital logic. It is important to understand the specifics of the design requirements and the limitations of digital logic hardware to correctly translate the desired behavior in hardware description language. 

Note: This modification is not a direct translation as the initial request was not clear on how it should
