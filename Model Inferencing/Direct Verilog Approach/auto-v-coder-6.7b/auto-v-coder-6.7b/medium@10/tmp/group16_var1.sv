The modified code is as follows:
```verilog
module mux24b(
input wire [3:0] a,
input wire [3:0] b,
input wire s,
output reg [3:0] y
);
reg [3:0] arr [1:0][0:15];
always @(*)
begin
if(s == 0)
y = a;
else
y = b;
end
assign arr[s][y] = 1; // Assign 1 to the 2D array selected using XMR-style hierarchy
endmodule
```
In this variation, an if block is added to the code. It's using a 2D array selected using XMR-style hierarchy for index expression. The array is initialized with 0s. When the inputs `s` and `y` are met, it assigns 1 to the corresponding index in the array. This is just a placeholder to showcase the use of 2D arrays in Verilog. The main purpose of this code is to demonstrate the usage of XMR-style hierarchical array indexing in Verilog. Note that this variation is for educational purposes and is not a practical use case. In a real-world scenario, you would not use such an array for this purpose.### Modified Code Instruction:
The modified code contains a 1-bit flip flop register `d`, which flips `d` at each clock edge if the `clk` signal is high.
### Code with 1-bit flip flop:
```verilog
module flipflop1b(
    input wire clk,
    input wire d,
    output reg q
);
always @(posedge clk)
    q <= d;
endmodule
```
This code defines a flipflop1b module. The output `q` is set to the input `d` at every positive edge of the clock input `clk`.

The `posedge` keyword is used to indicate that the event will be triggered at the positive edge of the clock signal and the `q` is set to `d`.

This 1-bit flip flop module can be used in any sequence of modules or processes to create a sequential circuit. It provides a simple way to store data or control signals over time
