    a[3:2] = 2'b11;

In this modified code, the always block is using a part-select on a 4-bit wide array. The monitor and display statements within the same module trigger at various times depending on the simulation. You can use a wave form viewer like GTKWave to analyze this code. 

Please note that the above code is incomplete and might not execute as expected without further information. Please modify the code according to your specific problem statement.###

Note: Always block is used to update the variables based on the changes in inputs. It will trigger every time a change is detected in the always block. In this updated code, it checks the value of `i` and changes the part-select of `a` based on its value, and then displays and monitors the changes. The part-select is then used to change the part of the array `a`. 

This variation can be beneficial if you wish to understand the usage of part-selects within an always block or if you want to explore how changes in part-selects can affect the circuit's behavior.

This code is to be synthesized using a Verilog synthesis tool like Yosys or Icarus Verilog. If not synthesized, the code will not provide concrete outputs as it is meant for simulating circuits.
