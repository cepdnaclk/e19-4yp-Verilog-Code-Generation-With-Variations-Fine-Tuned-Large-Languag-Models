```verilog
module dff(do,di,clk); // Behavioral D Flip-Flop
output reg do;
input di,clk;
initial
do=1'b0; // Initialize output
// Assign input 'di' to output 'do' on negative clock edge
always@(negedge clk)
begin
    case(do)
        'b0: do = di;
        'b1: do = di;
    endcase
end // Use non-blocking <= for sequential logic
endmodule
```

This code adds a case statement inside an always block. The case statement checks the value of 'do' and assigns 'di' to 'do' if 'do' is either 0 or 1. The case statement ensures that the value of 'do' is either the current value of 'di' or the same previous value of 'di'. This ensures that the flipping mechanism is not interrupted by external changes to 'do'. If 'do' is not 0 or 1, the case statement will cause a compile-time error.

If 'do' is a list of values, a range can be added. Please note that a case statement is a hardware description and there's no need for constant range list for array index in case statement according to Verilog 2001 standard. 

Note: The output 'do' is still defined as reg, not wire, because it is procedurally assigned in an always block. If it were defined as wire, it would be combinational and wouldn't be able to be assigned in a procedural assignment within an always block. 

This modification gives different behavior from the standard D Flip-Flop and is not recommended for practical use, but it was included for completeness. It is also important to mention that Verilog is case sensitive with respect to identifiers and case statement labels. 

If using a different synthesis tool to produce a netlist, it may or may not support case statements. However, this code is a well formed Verilog code according to the Verilog-2001 standard, and the code is designed to be synthesizable and correctly implement a D flip-flop. 

This is a modification meant to create a Verilog coding challenge/example and is not recommended for use in a
