```verilog
module gates4_top (
input wire [3:0] sw,
output reg [2:0] ld
);

gates4 U1 // Assuming 'gates4' provides and4_, or4_, xor4_ outputs from input 'x'
(
.x(sw),
.and4_(ld[2]),
.or4_(ld[1]),
.xor4_(ld[0])
);

integer i;
always @* begin
    case (sw)
        4'b0001 : ld = 3'b100;
        4'b0010 : ld = 3'b010;
        4'b0100 : ld = 3'b001;
        4'b1000 : ld = 3'b000;
        default : ld = 3'b000;
    endcase
end

endmodule
```
In this code, a priority case (using a priority logic) is added to the `always` block. This case has the same logic as the switch case in the previous code, but is implemented using priority logic. The output is set to 3'b100 for the case of 4'b0001, 3'b010 for 4'b0010, 3'b001 for 4'b0100, and 3'b000 for 4'b1000 and default case.

Remember to adjust the input and output ports as needed.
This code will generate a priority output based on the input. If the input is not exactly 4'b0001, 4'b0010, 4'b0100 or 4'b1000, the output will be 3'b000. Be sure to adjust the priority case accordingly if your inputs' priority is not linear.

Note: Always use reg for output signals in Verilog. In this example, it should be a reg[2:0] for the output. However, for simplicity, it's declared as wire[2:0] in the beginning. It must be changed according to your requirement.
