```verilog
module pulses; // Incorrect pulse generation attempt
  reg [8:0] I;
  reg a,b;
  initial
    while (I<100) begin // Loop based on integer I
      b = I[1]; // Assign bit 1 of I to b (Corrected indexing)
      case (I) // Assign bit 1 of I (bit 0 in this case) to b
        9'b1xxxxxxx: I='d101; // For every value of I between 1 and 100, I is incremented to 101
        9'b101xxxxx: I='d102; // For every value of I between 101 and 102, I is incremented to 102
        9'b10101xxx: I='d103; // For every value of I between 102 and 103, I is incremented to 103
        // Add more cases for other ranges as needed
        default: I = I + 1; // For any value of I not falling into these ranges, increment I
      endcase
    end
  initial I=0; // Initialize I
  initial #100 $stop; // Stop simulation
endmodule
```

This code will increment I from 1 to 100, and after reaching the number 100, it will stop the simulation. The I value is incremented by a unique number in each case statement, based on the range of I it represents. This way, the loop will skip over certain values of I, which can be useful for debugging.

Please replace 'd101, 'd102, 'd103 with the actual numbers you need to increment I with, based on your specific requirements. ### Note: The logic in the case(I) is just an example and the numbers should be adjusted to match your specific needs. The actual logic would have to be determined based on the specific conditions you want to skip over. 

Finally, this code is written in Verilog and doesn't directly solve the problem of generating pulses using a Verilog module. If you're looking for how to generate pulses using a Veril
