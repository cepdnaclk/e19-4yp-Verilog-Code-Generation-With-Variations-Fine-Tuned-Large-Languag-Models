This code creates a testbench for a CMOS switch module. It toggles the input signal "in" and the control signal "con" for 20 time units and stops the simulation after that. The simulation monitors the inputs and outputs of the CMOS switch.

```verilog
module tst_CMOSsw1();
  reg in,con; wire out;
  CMOSsw1 cmsw(out,in,con); // Instantiate CMOS switch
  initial begin 
    in=1'b0; 
    con=1'b1; 
    //$monitor($time, " in: %b, con: %b, out: %b", in, con, out);
    //$dumpvars(0, tst_CMOSsw1);
  end // Start enabled
  always #5 in =~in; // Toggle data
  always #3 con=~con; // Toggle control
  initial $monitor($time, " in: %b, con: %b, out: %b", in, con, out);
  initial begin 
    #20 $stop; // Stop simulation
  end
endmodule
```

This testbench uses an always block to toggle the input and control signals at different times. It uses the built-in $time system task to print the current simulation time, and the input and output values of the CMOS switch. The $stop directive is used to end the simulation at a specific time.

Please note that your actual implementation might differ, as the original code you provided does not specify what module or logic you are testing.

Also, it is important to note that the verilog code provided above should not be used in an actual system, as it may not run correctly due to the simulation specifics. It is for demo purposes or learning purposes only.

When using a real CMOS inverter, the result should be inverted by the 'out' port of the CMOS switch. If the CMOS switch is configured to function normally (i.e., when 'con' is high), the output 'out' should be the same as the control signal 'con'. If 'con' is low, the 'out' should also be low. This is due to the nature of CMOS switches, which can be both on and off at the same
