```verilog
module tst_wand1; //testbench
reg [5:0] i1,i2;
wire [5:0] o; // Added wire declaration
wand1 ww(i1,i2,o);
initial
begin
i1=6'b001001; // Drv1=001001, Drv2=000000 -> o = 000000 (wand rule)
i2=6'b000000;
end
initial $monitor($time,"i1=%b,i2=%b,o=%b",i1,i2,o);
initial #8 $stop; // Added stop
endmodule
```

This modified code will now monitor the outputs of your `wand1` module. The `wand1` gate will only output `1` when both inputs are `1`. The rest of the time, it will output `0`. This behavior can be tested in a testbench by setting inputs `i1` and `i2` to different values and observe the output `o`.

Remember to connect the `wand1` module inputs to the testbench signals `i1` and `i2`. The `wand1` module should also be defined in the same module or other module that you are using for the testbench. If it is not connected properly, you may get unexpected results. 

The `wand1` module is a custom module which takes two inputs and performs a 'wand' operation. It is assumed that the `wand1` module and its input/output signals are correctly defined elsewhere in the code. 

This is a simple testbench setup and does not handle any errors or incorrect input values. Please modify accordingly as per the requirements.
  
Please note that the above code assumes that the `wand1` module works as a 6-bit AND gate. If it's a different width, please adjust the `[5:0]` accordingly. The output `o` will also have a width of 6 bits.
  
In addition, the code assumes that the 6-bit inputs are being set to `6'b001001` and `6'b00
