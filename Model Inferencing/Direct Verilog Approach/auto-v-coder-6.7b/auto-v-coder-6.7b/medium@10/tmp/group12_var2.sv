```Verilog
module maj3 (a, b, c, y);
input a, b, c;
output y;
wire im1, im2, im3;
and #(2, 4)
    (im1, a, b),
    (im2, b, c),
    (im3, c, a);
or #(3, 5) (y, im1, im2, im3);

always @(posedge a, negedge b) begin
    int t;
    logic [1:0] x[4];
    t = `XMR_INDEX(x, 2'b01);
    $display("XMR_INDEX value of t is: %0d", t);
end
endmodule
```
In this example, a XMR-style index on a packed array and a constant range is being tested inside the always block. Inside the XMR_INDEX, constant values are used instead of variables, as variables may not be used in constant ranges. The `$display` function is used to print the XMR_INDEX value of t to the console.

Note: This is a simplified example and does not cover all potential use cases of XMR-style index. The actual use case might depend on the specific XMR-style index and the context in which it is used. Also, this example assumes that a, b and c are 1-bit signals as a, b and c should be the signals. Verilog syntax specifies a signal name as a name of a 1 bit object. Thus, we are assuming that a, b and c are 1-bit signals. Please modify the example according to the actual use case.###
For the XMR-style index, the following variables have been used:
- `int t`: This variable is a general purpose variable that can be used inside the XMR-style index.
- `logic [1:0] x[4]`: This is a packed array of 2-bit logic signals.

The `XMR_INDEX` macro has been used to get the value of t, and the macro takes two parameters: packed array named x and index 2'b01.

The `$display` function has been used to print the value of t to the console. This is just for demonstration purpose and is
