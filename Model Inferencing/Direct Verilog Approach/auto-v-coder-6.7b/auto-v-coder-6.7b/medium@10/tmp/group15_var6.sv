We are going to add an array "mem" of 256-elements to hold the results of the ALU operations. When the ALU performs a calculation, it will store the result in the location "left" in the array.

```Verilog
timescale 1ns/100ps
module ALU8 (input [7:0] left, right, input [1:0] mode, output [255:0] mem);
always_comb begin
    case (mode)
        0: mem[left] = left + right;
        1: mem[left] = left - right;
        2: mem[left] = left & right;
        3: mem[left] = left | right;
        default: ;
    endcase
end
endmodule
```
This way, you can use this module to perform ALU operations without changing Verilog code in the ALU module itself. This way, the user can use the mem array to store results of the ALU operations.

Do remember that the location of storing the result is determined by the left operand. If you want to store the results in different locations, you would need to change the "left" input to a different operand.### Note:
This modified code only works if the left operand is an 8-bit number in the range from 0 to 255. If you are using a larger operand, you would need to modify the ALU8 module to accommodate that. 

Also, the results of the operations are not "overwriting" the location of the previous result. The new results are stored in the location determined by the left operand. 

Always remember to check the operation limits with the type of operation and data size in your case.###
Always remember to use the "always_comb" keyword to ensure the block of statements is not sensitive to flip-flop-triggered changes, or else it will lead to a race condition. This will ensure that the result of the operation is not undefined when the operands change.###
The "case" statement inside the always_comb block is an efficient way to handle many different cases within a single statement. It's a good practice to use this keyword when you're handling a wide variety of inputs.###
The code is written to be synthesizable
