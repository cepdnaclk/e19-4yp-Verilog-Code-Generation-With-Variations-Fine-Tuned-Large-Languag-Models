```verilog
module tst_CMOSsw1();
  reg in,con; wire out;
  wire [1:0] out_slice; // Adjusted output type to wire array
  CMOSsw1 cmsw(out_slice[0],in,con); // Instantiate CMOS switch
  initial begin in=1'b0; con=1'b1; end // Start enabled
  always #5 in =~in; // Toggle data
  always #3 con=~con; // Toggle control
  initial $monitor($time, "in = %b, con = %b, output = %b ",in,con,out_slice[0]);
  initial #20 $stop; // Stop simulation
endmodule
```
This code is identical in functionality to the original code, but it uses an array of wires to represent the output of the CMOS switch. This is useful when Verilog simulation tools can't directly handle multiple drivers on a net, which is the case in this case.

Please change 'out' to 'out_slice[0]' to match the output. This is due to the fact that the CMOSsw1 module may be outputting two values, so we must specify a single value to match the output. The code would not compile or perform as expected if 'out' was used directly. Also note that the instantiation of CMOSsw1 module is changed to accommodate the array of wire output which has size 2. Also, array can be indexed as per the requirement.

The code snippet is modified to fit the needs of the system. If the system does not support the direct access of an array of wires, then the code should be modified to accommodate direct access/handle the array of wires. This is not related to the base Verilog code but is a common problem in simulation. In some situations, it is better to use an array instead of a wire. Please adjust the code based on the situation.joy#
