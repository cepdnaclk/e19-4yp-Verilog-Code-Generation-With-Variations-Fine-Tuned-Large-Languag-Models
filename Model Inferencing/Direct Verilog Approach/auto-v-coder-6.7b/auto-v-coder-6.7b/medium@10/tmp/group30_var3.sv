```verilog
module dff_with_reset(data, clock, r, out);
input clock, r, data;
output out;
reg out;
always @(posedge clock or posedge r)
begin
if (r)
out = 0;
else
out = data;
end

// Variation
integer arr[0:5] = '{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}; // Array of numbers from 1 to 6
assign out = (out inside {arr[0:4]})? 1'b1 : 1'b0;
endmodule
```
In this code, the inside operator is used inside the procedural block to check if the output from the DFF is within the range of array 'arr'. If 'out' is within the range of 'arr' then a 1'b1 is assigned to 'out', otherwise a 1'b0 is assigned. This will toggle the output when 'out' is within the specified range of 'arr'. Note that the upper bound of the range is 'arr[4]'.### Note: The Verilog system verilog doesn't support the 'inside' operator. The Verilog language doesn't support the 'inside' operator. The 'inside' operator is specific to SystemVerilog, a superset of Verilog. If you are writing in Verilog, you would typically use the 'in' operator in the procedural block to accomplish the same task.

Here's an example of how to use 'in' instead of 'inside':

```verilog
wire [2:0] out;
always @(*) begin
    if (out in '{1, 2, 3, 4, 5})
        out = 3'b1;
    else
        out = 3'b0;
end
```
This code would set 'out' to '3'b1' if 'out' is in the range of '{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}', and 'out' to '3'b0' otherwise. 
The 'in' operator is generally used for Verilog and not supported in SystemVerilog. For SystemVerilog, you would use the '
