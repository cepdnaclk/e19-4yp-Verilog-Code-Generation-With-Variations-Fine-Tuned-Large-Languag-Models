```verilog
module example7_5(x1, x2, x3, Clock_i, f, g);
input x1, x2, x3, Clock_i;
output f, g;
reg f, g;
wire [1:0] Clock_i_array = {Clock_i, 1'b0};
always @(posedge Clock_i_array[1])
begin
    f = x1 & x2;
    g = f | x3;
end
endmodule
```
With this modification, the Clock input is converted into a two-bit wire, and then selected as an element of this array in the `always @(posedge...)` statement. This way, the combinational logic of `f = x1 & x2` and `g = f | x3` is performed on the falling edge of the selected Clock. Note that the array is initialized with both clock signals, which is why the 1'b0 is added as the last element. This way, the falling edge of Clock_i will activate the always block.

You may use this code as a template for your own designs. However, be aware that this modification might have undesired effects depending on the design's requirements. For example, if both Clock signals are active at the same time, the output might not behave as expected. It's always important to consider the specific needs and behavior of your design when applying these modifications. 

Also, remember that if you have multiple drivers for the same signal, Verilog might behave unpredictably. It is worthwhile to consult with a Verilog engineer when using this kind of modification. ### Note: This code is for Verilog, not SystemVerilog, so not all of the SystemVerilog features might be available. Verilog supports a much simpler design construct, albeit with less expressive power. For SystemVerilog designs, you should use a more advanced constructs. In SystemVerilog, you could use a unique Clock with a gate or a clocking block. This would be a better approach for real-world designs.
