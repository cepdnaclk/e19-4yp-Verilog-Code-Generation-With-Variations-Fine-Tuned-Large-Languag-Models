In this modified code, a `muxdff` module is replaced with `muxdff_i`. This is to allow the instantiation of `muxdff` with different array indices. The `packed_function_array_test` module creates a packed array `packed_array` and a for loop to sequentially instantiate a `muxdff_i` for each element in the `packed_array`.

This code is a bit hacky, but it does demonstrate how to use this Verilog code in a larger project by using it inside a for loop with the tested operand being a packed array element via function call index. Note that the `muxdff` module needs to be instantiable with a module name that ends with `_i `as shown in the modified code. 

This code may result in a Verilog elaboration error, as it's invalid syntax to directly instantiate a module inside a for loop. Depending on the specifics of the larger project, the usage may not compile correctly.

Lastly, this code demonstrates the syntax by which the instantiation is done, but it doesn'
