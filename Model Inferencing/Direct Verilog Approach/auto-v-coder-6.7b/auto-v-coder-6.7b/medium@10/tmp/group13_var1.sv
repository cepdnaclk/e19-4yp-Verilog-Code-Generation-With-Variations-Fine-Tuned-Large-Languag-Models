```verilog

begin
i1=0; i2=0; // Drv1=pull0, Drv2=pull0 -> o = pull0 (wand rule)
end
initial $monitor($time,"i1=%b,i2=%b,o_array[2]=%b,o_array_slice=%b",i1,i2,o_array[2],o_array_slice);

```
In this modified code, `o_array[2:0]` is an array of wire elements with dimensions from 2 to 0 and `o_array_slice` is a part-select range that selects the elements from `o_array` array from index 2 to 0. The `o_array[2]` is connected to the output wire `o` and then `o_array_slice` is being assigned to a wire.

This code tests the output of the `o_array[2]` and also checks the entire range of `o_array` elements using the `o_array_slice`. The `$monitor` is used to display the values of `i1`, `i2`, `o_array[2]`, and `o_array_slice` at each time step. This can be used to monitor the simulation process and verify the correctness of the design.

Keep in mind that the part-select notation is used to specify the range of the array slice, and the elements are selected starting from the highest index. So, `o_array_slice`'s value will be `o_array[2:0]`.

Also, the `$stop` directive is added at time 8 to stop the simulation after that time. This is to prevent the simulation from running infinitely.

Remember to change the `wand1` module in
