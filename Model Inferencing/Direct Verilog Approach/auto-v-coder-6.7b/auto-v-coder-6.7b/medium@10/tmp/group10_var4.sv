```verilog
module reg4(D, Clock, Resetn, Q, sel);
input [3:0] D;
input Clock, Resetn;
input [1:0] sel;
output [3:0] Q;
reg [3:0] Q;
always @(posedge Clock or negedge Resetn)
    if (Resetn == 0) begin
        Q <= 4'b0000;
    end else begin
        Q[sel] <= D[sel];  // dynamic array selection
    end
endmodule
```
In this modified code, D now has bits associated with 2 additional signals (sel[0] and sel[1]). The value of `sel` will determine which bit of 4-bit register `Q` is updated. The procedural continuous assignment is outside the always block. This code should work well and maintain the functionality of the original, but itâ€™s worth noting that if sel is not intended to be used this way, this modification might make it unclear.

For instance, when sel is used to select a register bit, and there's another purpose for sel, this can make the intent of the code clearer. For example, the original code might be using sel to index into a register array in a different module. In such a situation, the dynamic array selection of `Q` might not be a clear or obvious operation.

Therefore, the design decision to add dynamic array selection based on variable index `sel` would be depend on the specific use case and design of the module or system. It's always better to have a clear understanding of your design and why you are doing this particular modification. ### This is very basic usage of procedural continuous assignments and the syntax might not be strictly correct as per the verilog standard yet it should work for some basic simulations.  

Remember that procedural continuous assignments are not necessarily synthesizable. If you want to check the synthesize-ability, try to use them within a `generate statement` to generate your modules. The reason is that procedural continuous assignments can be synthesized to flip-flops or latches depending on the tool being used. By using `generate`, the procedural continuous assignments can be synthesized as combinational logic. However, note that it's not a good practice to use procedural continuous assignments
