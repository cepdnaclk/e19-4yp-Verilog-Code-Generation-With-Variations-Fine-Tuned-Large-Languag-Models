```verilog
module example7_4(D, Clock, Q1, Q2);
input D, Clock;
output reg Q1, Q2;
reg [7:0] packed_array;
parameter integer index = 2;

always @(posedge Clock)
begin
    Q1 <= D;
    Q2 <= Q1;
    packed_array <= {$random} % 256; 
    while(index > 0) begin
        Q2 <= packed_array[index-1];
        index = index - 1; 
    end
end
endmodule
```
In this modified code, a packed array of 8-bit elements is defined. The while loop condition checks if the index is greater than 0. Inside the while loop, the variable index decreases by 1 each iteration, and the value of index-1 is assigned to Q2. The value of packed_array is updated each clock cycle using a $random command, which generates a random 8-bit number. It provides a random value at each iteration.###

Note: The use of "$random()" function in Verilog may not always produce a random number because it depends on the state of the random number generator (which is initialized by the testbench). Thus, using it in an always block may not yield a different output each time it is executed. In such situations, using $urandom() function may help to produce random numbers each time the block is executed. However, the output of $urandom() depends on the seed value which is reset before the beginning of each simulation.

Also, for the loop condition, the example used `index > 0`. This means the loop will execute as long as the index counter (`index`) is greater than 0. It is important to ensure that the index counter will eventually reach 0, or else the loop will potentially go on indefinitely. In the modified code, the index is decreased by 1 each time until it reaches 0, thus terminating the loop.###

Remember that a packed array is a way to store multiple bits in a single bit lane. The example in the while loop is just a representation of how to use such an array. The actual value of index - 1 can be changed based on the specific requirements.###
