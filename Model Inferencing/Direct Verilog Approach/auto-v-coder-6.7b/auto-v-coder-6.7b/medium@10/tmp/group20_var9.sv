```verilog
module Chap1Counter (Clk, Reset, Count);
input Clk, Reset;
output [3:0] Count;
reg [3:0] Count;
always @(posedge Clk) begin
    if(Reset) Count = 0;
    else begin
        Count = Count + 1;
        // Procedural assignment
        Count[2:0] = 3'b111; // Assign 3'b111 to the least significant 3 bits of the 4-bit vector Count
    end
end
endmodule
```
In this modified code, an assignment to a specific index of a packed vector array slice occurs inside the procedural block of the always statement. This is done by using the square bracket assignment `Count[2:0] = 3'b111`. This assignment will overwrite the least significant 3 bits of the 4-bit vector Count. The remaining 1 bit of Count is unaffected.

Note: The indexing of the packed vector array slice (Count[2:0]) is zero-based, which means the most significant bit is counted as the first bit and the least significant bit as the last bit. So, in this case, the least significant 3 bits will be overwritten with the value of 3'b111.

Furthermore, the "else-statement" in the "always" block is optional. If you want to keep the current behavior of incrementing the Count variable every positive edge of the clock input, you can remove the "begin-end" block. 

The original task is to design a counter with a maximum value of 3. Thus, the assignment to `Count[2:0] = 3'b111;` is done to ensure that the least significant 3 bits of the Count variable remain unchanged, but the most significant bit is set to a fixed value of 1. This ensures that the counter never exceeds the value of 3.

Thus, this variation of the original code adds a procedural assignment within a final block using inside on a packed vector array slice. The assignment is done to a specific index of a packed vector array slice, effectively setting the least significant 3 bits of the 4-bit vector Count to a specific value. The remaining 1 bit of Count remains unaffected. This
