```verilog
module RAM (output[7:0] Obus, input[7:0] Ibus, input[3:0] Adr, input Clk, Read);
reg[7:0] Storage[15:0];
reg[7:0] ObusReg;
assign #1 Obus = ObusReg;
always @(posedge Clk)
begin
    if(Read==1'b0)
        Storage[Adr] <= Ibus;
    else
        ObusReg <= Storage[Adr];
    integer i;
    for (i = 0; i < 16; i++) begin
        if (Adr == i) begin
            Storage[i] <= Ibus;
        end
    end
end
endmodule
```
With the addition of a for loop, you can ensure that the operation is performed 16 times for every clock cycle, which demonstrates the use of array-slice operator with a constant range. This code is not synthesizable, as it is purely for illustrative purposes. In a synthesizable design, you would not create a loop to access array elements and modify them if you do not need to. In such a case, you should use a normal array element assignment to modify the array elements. The first code example is correct and synthesizable. The second code example demonstrates a while loop, which is not generally recommended for synthesis and is only used for illustrative purposes.

The second example can be optimized to a synthesizable single-line assignment as:
```verilog
module RAM (output[7:0] Obus, input[7:0] Ibus, input[3:0] Adr, input Clk, Read);
reg[7:0] Storage[15:0];
reg[7:0] ObusReg;
assign #1 Obus = ObusReg;
always @(posedge Clk)
    if(Read==1'b0)
        Storage[Adr] <= Ibus;
    else
        ObusReg <= Storage[Adr];
endmodule
```
However, keep in mind that the code in the "while" loop example is not logically equivalent to the first code example. The if statement inside the always block will be executed on every clock cycle, while the first example'
