This code creates a simple JK flip-flop toggling based on the last state of output q_out. It also uses a case statement to toggle q based on the state of the output q_out. Note that the inside function is used to determine if the output q_out is inside a particular state. This function is used to determine the state of q based on the output state of the flip-flop. This allows for more complex behavior based on the state of the output. The case statement is then used to transition q based on the output state. (The "inside" function is a simple function that checks if a value is inside a range, but it is not used in the context of this example. That's why the function has not been included as an example.) 

This code does not have a parallel NMOS transistors for simulation because it does not use such a transistor as a part of the logic. However, in a real system, the use of NMOS transistors would be necessary to implement the logic function. This modification provides a basic understanding of a case statement usage in a Verilog code snippet.
