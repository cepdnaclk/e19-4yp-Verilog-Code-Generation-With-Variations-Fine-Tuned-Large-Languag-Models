```verilog
timescale 1ns/100ps
module ShiftRegister8 (input sl, sr, clk, input [7:0] ParIn, input [1:0] m, output reg [7:0] ParOut);
always @(negedge clk) begin
    case (m)
        0: ParOut <= ParOut;
        1: ParOut <= {sl, ParOut[7:1]};
        2: ParOut <= {ParOut[6:0], sr};
        3: ParOut <= ParIn;
        default: ParOut <= 8'bX;
    endcase
    
    case (m) inside {[0:2]}:
        // Your code here
        // For example:
        // ParOut <= {ParOut[6:0], sr};
    endcase
end
endmodule
```
With this implementation, the code inside the case statement with the range [0:2] (inclusive) will be executed each time the value of `m` falls within this range. This allows for a dynamic range of values that the output value will be dependent on. This makes the code more dynamic and flexible. It also gives additional control to the verilog code.
This modification increases the flexibility and control over the output value based on the range of the input. It's good to note that the inside operator may not be supported in all verilog simulators, in which case you can use a traditional case statement with a condition instead.### Note: The above code assumes you want to add an element to a vector after the first element and a bit to the last element. You can adjust this to your need. You can also replace the default case with any other behavior you desire. This is a basic example, please adjust the syntax and logic based on your specific requirement.### For example, if you want to add a bit to the first half and another bit to the second half, you can do something like this:
```verilog
timescale 1ns/100ps
module ShiftRegister8 (input sl, sr, clk, input [7:0] ParIn, input [1:0] m, output reg [7:0] ParOut);
always @(negedge clk) begin
    case (m)
