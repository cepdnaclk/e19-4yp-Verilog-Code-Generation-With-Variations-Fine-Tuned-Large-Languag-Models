```verilog
module test_k;
wire [0:1][0:1] q, clock, j, k, preset, clear;
reg [0:1][0:1] j, k;
jkEdgeFF jk(q, clock, j, k, preset, clear);
initial
begin
reset_ff;
j = 1;
k = 0;
end
m555 timer(clock);
endmodule
```
In this code, `q`, `clock`, `j`, `k`, `preset`, and `clear` are constant arrays with dimensions 2x2 made up of logic. The `initial` block defines a procedural assignment with a constant index into the array. This modification should test MDA behavior for Verilog design. If the design does not behave as expected, it may indicate a problem with your design or the simulation or synthesis tool being used.### Note: This code should be used for educational purposes and should not be used for real-world circuit design. It's a simple and basic example and does not demonstrate all of the features of the Verilog hardware description language. It's just a starting point for you to learn and experiment. If you are new to Verilog, it would be a good idea to follow along a programming language course or tutorial before embarking on a project this complex. It's also important to understand the principles of digital logic and how these designs work before starting work on real-world projects.!
