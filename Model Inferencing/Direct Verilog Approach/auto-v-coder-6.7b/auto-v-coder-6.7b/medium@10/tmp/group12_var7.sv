In this modified code, `logic [7:0] packed_array` is declared as a packed array. Inside the always block, a nested loop is used to index the array with different indexes i and j. The XMR style indexing is achieved by assigning values into the array at every iteration. The `$display` function is used to print the indexed array value. Thus, you can see the variations on the array values at every clock cycle. This function can be useful for debugging and verifying the results of the design.

Remember to replace the `$display` function with `$monitor` for continuous monitoring of the signal values. Also, make sure that your synthesis tool does not optimize away the `$display` function, or adjust the synthesis constraints to allow it. 

Also, please be aware that this might not be synthesizable since it requires continuous simulation. The synthesis tools will not synthesize the code inside the always block. 

Also, this code assumes that the delay of the `always` block is less than the delay of the `$display` function call. Otherwise, the signals may not be updated before being displayed. To account for this, you may need to use non-blocking assignments (`<=`) instead of blocking assignments (`=`) for the `pack
