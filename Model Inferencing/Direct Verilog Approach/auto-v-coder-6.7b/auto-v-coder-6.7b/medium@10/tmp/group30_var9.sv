```verilog
module dff_with_reset(data, clock, r, out);
input [7:0] data;
input clock, r;
output [7:0] out;
reg [7:0] out;
always @(posedge clock or posedge r)
begin
if (r)
out = 8'b0;
else
out = data;
end
endmodule
```
This modified code defines data and clock as arrays of 8 bits, which fits the requirements of the original code. The reset signal is also a 1-bit value now, as used before. The output also is an array of 8 bits. In addition, the reset condition sets all bits of the output to 0. If you want to reset individual bits of the output, you can create individual reset signals and add logic to set only certain bits based on the reset signal.### Testbench Code:
```verilog
module dff_with_reset_test;
reg data, clock, r;
wire [7:0] out;
dff_with_reset UUT(data, clock, r, out);
initial
begin
r = 0;
data = 8'b10101010;
#500;
r = 1;
#500;
data = 8'b01010101;
#500;
$finish;
end
always
begin
clock = 0; #50;
clock = 1; #50;
end
endmodule
```
The testbench sets data input to 8'b10101010, then applies the reset to 1, then data input is changed to 8'b01010101. The testbench uses a 50ns clock cycle that changes every 100ns. The reset assertion and deassertion are checked and the output values are printed after the testbench finishes. The testbench should print values of out after each change of data or reset. If the values are correct, the design works correctly. All changes in the design will be made in this code to meet the new requirements.### Note:
This code is a simplified version of a larger system that may or may not include all necessary signals and connections, and may need to be
