```verilog
module RAM (output[7:0] Obus, input[7:0] Ibus, input[3:0] Adr, input Clk, Read);
reg[7:0] Storage[15:0];
reg[7:0] ObusReg;
assign #1 Obus = ObusReg;
always @(posedge Clk)
if (Read==1'b0) begin
    int i;
    while (i < 16) begin  // added while loop instead of if condition
        Storage[i] <= Ibus;
        i = i + 1;
    end
end
else
    ObusReg <= Storage[Adr];
endmodule
```
This code ensures that all elements of the `Storage` array are written with `Ibus` value if `Read` is 0, and the `ObusReg` is written with the corresponding element of `Storage` array if `Read` is 1. The `while` loop has been added to handle array elements properly. It increments the `i` value from 0 to 15 each time after the element of `Storage` has been written. This ensures that all elements of the `Storage` array are written. If you want to write only specific elements, you can adjust the while loop condition according to your needs. Note that the purpose of the `Read` signal is unclear in the original code. It should be set to 1 if you want to read from the RAM instead of writing to it.

This code does not perform memory operations in parallel, as it does not support multi-dimensional arrays in Verilog. If parallelism is a requirement, you can use `$readmemb` system task or similar methods to read the external file. However, this will be more complex and may not be supported by your synthesis tool. Also, it is not a good practice to make your SystemVerilog code look like C code. Instead, structure your logic in a way that is clear and easy to understand. If the `Read` signal is meant to be used as a control signal, then it should not be part of the `@(posedge Clk)` process sensitivity list. It should be part of the sensitivity list of a separate process, maybe a `control_process`. This makes your code more modular and easier to debug.
