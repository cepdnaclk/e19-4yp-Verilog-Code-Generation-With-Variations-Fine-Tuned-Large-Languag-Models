In this variation, the case statement has been modified to use the s signal as an index to select an element in the selected_c wire array. This enables more flexibility and dynamic handling of the mux selection process. ### Note:

Remember that Verilog uses a one-hot encoding for muxing. If you want to use binary encoding instead of one-hot, you need to change the condition in the case statement to match the binary encoding of the s signal. ### The first example uses a simple combinational logic to perform the mux operation, while the second example uses a more dynamic and flexible approach using a case statement with dynamic index selection. ### Both versions will produce the same output, it's just a matter of preference and how you prefer to structure your code. The mux41b module with case statement would provide more flexibility and scalability in case you need to add or remove mux inputs in the future.
