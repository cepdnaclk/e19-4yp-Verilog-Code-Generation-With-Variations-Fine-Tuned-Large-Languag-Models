This modification will output the count values on a LED array.

```verilog
module Chap1Counter(Clk, Reset, LED);
input Clk, Reset;
output [7:0] LED;
wire [3:0] Count;

Chap1Counter uut (.Clk(Clk),.Reset(Reset),.Count(Count));

always @(posedge Clk) begin
   case (Count)
      4'b0000: LED = 8'b00000001;
      4'b0001: LED = 8'b00000010;
      4'b0010: LED = 8'b00000100;
      4'b0011: LED = 8'b00001000;
      4'b0100: LED = 8'b00010000;
      4'b0101: LED = 8'b00100000;
      4'b0110: LED = 8'b01000000;
      4'b0111: LED = 8'b10000000;
      4'b1000: LED = 8'b00000000;
      default: LED = 8'b00000000;
   endcase
end

endmodule
```
This Verilog code represents a binary counter with 3-bit output and it is then displayed on the 7-segment display. The 7-segment LED pattern is displayed according to the counter value.

Please replace the signal assigning part with your own code. This module contains a count value and a procedural assignment within a final block using inside on a packed vector array slice. This code will drive the LEDs based on the count value. The LED output has been modified to comply with the 7-segment display pattern.

Please remember that this code does not include the actual 7-segment LED driver details. You need to replace `8'b` with the actual 7-segment LED driver code to make it work. The 7-segment
