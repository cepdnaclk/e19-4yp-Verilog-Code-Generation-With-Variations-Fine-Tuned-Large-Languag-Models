```verilog
module RAM (output[7:0] Obus, input[7:0] Ibus, input[3:0] Adr, input Clk, Read);
reg[7:0] Storage[15:0];
reg[7:0] ObusReg;
assign #1 Obus = ObusReg;
always @(posedge Clk)
begin
    if (Read==1'b0)
        Storage[Adr] <= Ibus;
    else
        ObusReg <= Storage[Adr];
end
endmodule
```

### Explanation:

The original code was fine when it comes to synthesizing a Verilog design. However, for synthesizing purposes, one might encounter problems like incorrect timing and power consumption. Here is a variation of the code that uses a while loop, which can potentially lead to a more complex and potentially larger Verilog design, possibly making it harder to synthesize.

```verilog
module RAM (output[7:0] Obus, input[7:0] Ibus, input[3:0] Adr, input Clk, Read);
reg[7:0] Storage[15:0];
reg[7:0] ObusReg;
assign #1 Obus = ObusReg;

always @(posedge Clk)
begin
    while(1)
    begin
        if (Read==1'b0)
            Storage[Adr] <= Ibus;
        else
            ObusReg <= Storage[Adr];
    end
end
endmodule
```

This variation will not synthesize, but gives an idea of how one might approach this problem. It's important to understand that using while loops in a synthesizable design is generally not recommended, because the synthesis tools do not have a means to determine the exit condition of the loop. Also, the timing analysis in synthesis tools will be more complex, as they don't know that the loop will execute forever. 

So, it's generally better to avoid the while loop in favor of a different construct or more logic, which can be optimized for synthesis and timing analysis. This might involve a different structure or using a different language for synthesis that can handle such high-level constructs. A different approach, like
