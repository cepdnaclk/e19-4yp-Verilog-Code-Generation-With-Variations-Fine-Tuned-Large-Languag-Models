```verilog
module clock_gen_for;
  reg clk, en;
  reg [31:0] i;
  wire [7:0] tick;
  assign tick = 8'h01 << (i % 8);

  always @(posedge en)
    for (i = 0; i < 256; i = i + 1) begin
      #2 clk = ~clk;
      if (tick[i % 8]) break; // Break out of the loop when tick[i % 8] is asserted
    end

  initial begin
    clk = 1'b0;
    en = 1'b0;
  end
  initial $monitor("clk=%b, t=%0d, en=%b ", clk, $time, en);
endmodule
```
In this code, we are using a for-loop to generate a clock with period of 128 time units. The tick signal is generated via a function call `tick = 8'h01 << (i % 8)`. This is a binary counter that rotates every 8 clock cycles (8'h01 << i). The loop will continue until the tick signal is asserted (i.e., the clock will be toggled at a frequency of 1 every 8 clock cycles). When the tick signal reaches a count of 256 (i.e., after 128 clock cycles), the loop will break to prevent overflow.

The initial section is the same as the base Verilog code. A continuous monitor is used to display the status of the clk, current time, and the state of the enable signal over time.

Please note that this is a simple example and may not be suitable for a real-world application due to the fact that it will consume all the available resources within a single cycle. In a real-world application, you should consider using a more suitable method for generating the clock, such as an external clock source or a clock divider or counter.
