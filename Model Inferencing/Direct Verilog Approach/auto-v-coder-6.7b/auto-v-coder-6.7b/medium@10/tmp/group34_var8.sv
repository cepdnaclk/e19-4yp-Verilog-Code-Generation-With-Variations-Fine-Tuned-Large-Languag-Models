```verilog
module gates4_top (
input wire [3:0] sw,
output wire [6:0] ld, // Change output wire to match 7-bit output
reg [1:0] sel
);

gates4 U1 // Assuming 'gates4' provides and4_, or4_, xor4_ outputs from input 'x'
(
.x(sw),
.and4_(ld[2]),
.or4_(ld[1]),
.xor4_(ld[0])
);

always_comb begin // Generate selection based on sw[1:0]
  case(sel)
    2'b00: ld[6:3] = '0;
    2'b01: ld[6:3] = sw[0];
    2'b10: ld[6:3] = sw[1];
    default: ld[6:3] = '0;
  endcase
end
endmodule
```
In the above code, the case statement generates a 4-bit signal from the input sw[1:0] without disturbing the existing 3-bit logic. The case statement sets ld[6:3] based on the sel signal, which is driven by sw[1:0]. This will result in sw[0] and sw[1] signaling ld[6:3] while sw[1:0] other than 00 or 01 or 10 will signal ld[6:3] as '0'. 

The `sel` signal is driven by the `sw[1:0]`; this allows to select a single input bit from `sw[0:1]`, `sw[2:3]`, or the two bits of `sw`. The `always_comb` block ensures that the selection signal `sel` is assigned to the correct value each time the `sw` signal changes.

The case statement here is designed to show how to use a multiplexer. It's not a typical way to select from multiple inputs, but it's useful if you want to make a design that uses an MDA to select between multiple inputs.

Note: Replace `sel` with `sw[1:0]` if
