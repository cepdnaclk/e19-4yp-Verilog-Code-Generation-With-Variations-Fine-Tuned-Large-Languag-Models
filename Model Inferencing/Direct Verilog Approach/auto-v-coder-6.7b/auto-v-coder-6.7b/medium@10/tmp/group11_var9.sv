   initial_value = $random;
   for (int i=0; i<8; i++) begin
      some_reg[i] = initial_value + i + random_function();

In this version, we have added an "initial" block with a variable "initial_value" initialized before the loop. Also, a "for" loop is used to assign values to some_reg array from this initial_value with an index offset. The random_function function generates a random number from 3 to 7 inclusive and returns it. This function is called as a part of the initial assignment. Note that this code is not synthesizable and purely for demonstration of the concept of initial block and function in Verilog. Verilog has `$urandom` for random number generation. 

The above code is just for demonstration and should not be used in synthesis. Generally used for simulations or testbenches where you need to assign some initial values at reset or initialization. ### Usage:

When you write a Verilog code for synthesis, you can use the initial block to assign initial values to registers or wires. However, it should not be used in the synthesizable code for the design. The above example is purely illustrative and should not be used. In synthesis environment, a different method should be used for the initial values assignment. In case you want to check the code, use a simulator like Icarus Verilog or ModelSim. ### Note:

The usage of initial block in Verilog is not widely accepted in synthesis environment, and should be used only for simulation or test purposes. Synthesizable code should not use initial block for setting initial values. Also note that, as
