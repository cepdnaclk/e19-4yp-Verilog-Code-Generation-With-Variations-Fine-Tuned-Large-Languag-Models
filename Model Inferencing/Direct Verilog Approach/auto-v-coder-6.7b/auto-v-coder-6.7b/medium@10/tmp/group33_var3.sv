```verilog
module tst_CMOSsw1();
  reg [3:0] in,con; wire [3:0] out;
  CMOSsw1 cmsw(out,in,con); // Instantiate CMOS switch
  initial begin in=4'b0000; con=4'b1111; end // Start enabled
  always #5 in =~in; // Toggle data
  always #3 con=~con; // Toggle control
  initial $monitor($time, "in = %b, con = %b, output = %b ",in,con,out);
  initial #20 $stop; // Stop simulation
endmodule
```
This code has been modified to use 4-bit registers `in` and `con` and 4-bit wire `out`. This allows for more detailed testing of the CMOS switch. 

The `con` register will be inverted every 3 clock cycles and the `in` register will be inverted every 5 clock cycles, similar to the original example. This should help in verifying the functionality of the CMOS switch and its response to the control and data inputs. 

Note: The `$monitor` statement should be changed to print all 4 bits of in, con and out. 

Furthermore, the `$monitor` statement was used to display the state of in, con, and out variables on the console. This was useful for debugging and visualizing the behavior of the design. Changed to print all 4-bits of the variables. 

As per the code, the design will continue to run for 20 clock cycles after which it will halt using `$stop`. 

The simulation will now give a detailed view of the operation of the CMOS switch. This is useful for testing and debugging the CMOS switch design. 

You can add more instances of this testbench module to verify the behavior of more CMOS switches.

Note: Please replace `CMOSsw1` with the actual module name in your design.### Note: 
Make sure to appropriately instantiate the CMOS switch with the correct number of bits. This example assumes that the CMOS switch is 4-bit (8 combinations of outputs and inputs). Please ensure to match the number of bits in your
