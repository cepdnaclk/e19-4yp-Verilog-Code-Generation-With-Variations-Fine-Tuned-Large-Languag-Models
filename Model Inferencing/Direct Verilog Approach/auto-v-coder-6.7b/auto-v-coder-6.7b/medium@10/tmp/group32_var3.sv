```verilog
module dff(do,di,clk); // Behavioral D Flip-Flop
output do;
input di,clk;
reg do; // Output must be reg for procedural assignment
initial
do=1'b0; // Initialize output
// Assign input 'di' to output 'do' on negative clock edge
always@(negedge clk) do = di; // Use non-blocking <= for sequential logic

// Adding a case
wire [1:0] arr [4:0] = '{1'b0, 1'b1, 1'b1, 1'b1, 1'b0};
always @(posedge clk) begin
    case(di)
        1'b0 : arr[2] <= 1'bx;
        1'b1 : arr[1:3] <= 1'b0;
        default : arr[4] <= 1'b0;
    endcase
end
endmodule
```
In this modified code, a case statement is added inside a clocked always block. The case block uses the same input 'di' as an index to manipulate the array 'arr'.

The case statement assigns the value '1'b0' to position 2 of the array when the input 'di' is '1'b0'. It also assigns '1'b0' to the range from the first position to the third position of the array when the input 'di' is '1'b1'. Lastly, it assigns '1'b0' to the last position of the array if input 'di' does not match '1'b0' or '1'b1'. This creates a bit of a hierarchy inside the array, while still keeping the array as a flat array for simplicity. 

Please be aware that Verilog does not support assigning specific index of an array to be a don't care ('x') value. In this case, I have used 'bx' to avoid the actual error during simulation.

Also, this code will not compile in some simulation environments due to the complex nature of the case statement used. This code is purely for educational purposes or verification of a concept. 

Lastly, for actual designs, it is recommended to use simpler or more
