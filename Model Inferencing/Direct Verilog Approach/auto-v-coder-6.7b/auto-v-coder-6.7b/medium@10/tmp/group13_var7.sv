```verilog
wire [3:0] o; // Added wire declaration for a four-bit output
wand1 ww[1:0](i1,i2,o[1:0]); // This will apply the wand on the first two bits

initial
begin
i1=0; i2=0; // Drv1=pull0, Drv2=pull0 -> o = pull0 (wand rule)
end
initial $monitor($time,"i1=%b,i2=%b,o=%b",i1,i2,o);
initial #8 $stop; // Added stop
endmodule
```
In this modified code, we have declared `o` as a four-bit wire, and applied the `wand1` gate on the first two bits of `o`. The indexing for `o[1:0]` is added to ensure that the result of the gate operation gets into the first two bits of `o`. The same simulation process remains.

Please note that this testbench won't work correctly for an array of 4 bits. If you are working with an array of 4 bits, you may need to adjust the looping and printing out of the signals to match the number of bits in your case.

Remember that Verilog is a hardware description language (HDL), so not all features of a procedural language are supported by its syntax and semantics. This includes loops, arrays, and function calls. For such cases, you would need to use a hardware description language like Python or C++ that supports such features.

Please also note that the wand1 gate is not a standard gate in Verilog. It's a custom gate defined in a different module, wand1, that is being used here for the purpose of the example. If this module doesn't exist, you will need to define it yourself or use a standard logic gate that meets the wand condition.

The Verilog language is designed to be simple and flexible, but there are some limitations when working with hardware description languages, particularly when dealing with hardware with a complex logic structure. Hence, some features may not be available or may require an extra line of code to define a custom logic gate in Verilog. 

The Verilog code could vary based on the logic gate used or the specific implementation of the gate
