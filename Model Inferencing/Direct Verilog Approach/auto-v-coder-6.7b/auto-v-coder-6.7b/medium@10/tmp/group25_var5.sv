```verilog

input x1, x2, x3, Clock;
output f, g;
reg f, g;
always @(posedge Clock)
begin
    f = x1 & x2;
    case({x1,x2,x3})
    3'b000: g = 1;
    3'b001: g = 1;
    3'b010: g = 0;
    3'b011: g = 1;
    3'b100: g = 0;
    3'b101: g = 1;

In this code, the inputs x1, x2, and x3 are concatenated to form a 3-bit vector and this is used to index a 2^3 case statement that assigns 0 or 1 to the output `g` based on the 3-bit condition. The code is a simple way of encoding a 2-input AND gate with a 1-input OR gate.

Note: The `case` syntax in Verilog is not straightforward to use for simple combinatorial logic. It may not be the most efficient solution for this example, but it's just for demonstration and illustration. In particular, you can represent this logic more concisely with fewer lines of code.

Make sure to understand that the above code is just for demonstration. Do not use this for any serious design, as it does not handle all possible input combinations well. This code is illustrating how a `case` statement can be used in a Verilog module. In a real-world design, you should use a more efficient solution, such as a 2-input AND gate followed by an 1-input OR gate.
