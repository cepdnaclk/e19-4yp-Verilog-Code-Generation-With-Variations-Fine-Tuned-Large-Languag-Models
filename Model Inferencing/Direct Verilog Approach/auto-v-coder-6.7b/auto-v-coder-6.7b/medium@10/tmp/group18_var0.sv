```verilog
module maj3_p (input a, b, c, output y);
wire im1, im2, im3;
parameter
    tplh1=2, tphl1=4,
    tplh2=3, tphl2=5;
and #(tplh1, tphl1)
    (im1, a, b),
    (im2, b, c),
    (im3, c, a);
or #(tplh2, tphl2) (y, im1, im2, im3);

always @* begin
  // modified code here
  y = $countones({im1, im2, im3}); // count one of wire values
end
endmodule
```

Please note that this code counts the number (or number of '1's) in a vector of wire values (`im1`, `im2`, `im3`), and assigns it to the output `y`. This can be further optimized using a counter, but this is a simple demonstration of how you could use a function-call return array with one of the Verilog operators. 

Also, the value of `y` will be equal to 2 only if the input is a, b and c are both 1. It will be equal to 1 if at least two inputs are 1. Otherwise, it will be 0. 

So, this modified code checks the number of '1's in the input and assigns that number to `y`. This can be used for checking majority of the inputs in the AND gate. If the number of '1's is more than or equal to 2, it returns 1, otherwise it returns 0.

You should modify this code accordingly to your exact requirement. The `$countones` function was used as a simple demonstration. Be aware that the Verilog `$countones` function returns the number of '1's in an array or array slice. This is a simplified example, and you may need to adjust the function call and use case according to your particular requirements.

For example, if you want to check that at least two of the inputs are 1, you should compare the result to 2. If you want to use this for a majority gate
