```verilog
module dff_with_reset(data, clock, r, out);
input [3:0] data;
input [1:0] clock;
input r;
output [3:0] out;
reg [3:0] out;
always @(posedge clock[1] or posedge r)
begin
if (r)
out = 0;
else
out = data;
end
endmodule
```
In this code, the `data` input is now an array of 4 bits (`[3:0]`). The `clock` input is now an array of 2 bits (`[1:0]`). The `out` output is now an array of 4 bits (`[3:0]`). The procedural block checks the `r` input and `clock[1]` (the second bit of the clock array) for negedge and resets the out array to 0. If `r` is 0, it assigns the `data` input to the `out` array.

Remember to check the design after modification to ensure correct function. The Verilog code is synthesizable and should run correctly for most FPGAs or simulators. However, this is a simple example and may not cover complex scenarios or constraints. Always test your code thoroughly to ensure that it operates as expected.###

You can add the code to your system verilog file and then compile it via command-line for the actual behavior.

```verilog
`include "dff_with_reset.v" 
module top();
reg [3:0] data;
reg [1:0] clock;
reg r;
wire [3:0] out;

// Instantiate the dff_with_reset module
dff_with_reset uut(
   .data(data),
   .clock(clock),
   .r(r),
   .out(out)
);

initial begin
    // Initialize data
    data = 4'b1010;
    // Initialize clock
    clock = 2'b00;
    // Initialize r
    r = 0;
    #5;
    // Toggle r
    r = ~r;
    #5;
