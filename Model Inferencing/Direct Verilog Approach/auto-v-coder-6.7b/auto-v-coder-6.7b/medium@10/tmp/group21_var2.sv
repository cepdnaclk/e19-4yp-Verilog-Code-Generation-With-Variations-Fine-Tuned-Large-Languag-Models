In this code, we have replaced the single output NMOS inverter with a 4D array of inversions. The input and output are now 4D arrays. This enables us to index into the arrays using case statement, which makes it easy to switch between different combinations of inputs/ outputs. The 'x' state is also considered for inputs. This code also includes an always block that responds to inputs changes by updating the output based on the input. If the input is 'x' in the case statement, the output is also set to 'x'.

Note: This code assumes that the NMOS inv function is a 4D array of inverses. If it's not, it needs to be updated to the actual function. Also, the 'nmv' module is used to make a function of 'in' inputs and 'out'
