```verilog
module contres(o,i1,i2);
input i1,i2;
output o;
// Drive wire 'o' from two buffers with specified output strengths
buf(pull1, weak0) g1(o,i1); // Drives pull '1', weak '0'
buf(pull1, weak0) g2(o,i2); // Drives pull '1', weak '0'
// Resolution: 1,1->1; 1,0->1; 0,1->1; 0,0->0; 1,Z->1; 0,Z->X; Z,Z->Z
// Effective behavior is OR due to pull1 dominance over weak0
initial begin
   integer i;
   for (i=0; i<4; i++) begin
     #1; // Delay for 1 time unit to ensure the state changes
     $display("Inputs: i1=%b, i2=%b, Output: o=%b", i[1], i[0], o);
   end
end
endmodule
```

The initial block is inserted to test the design at different inputs. The for loop is used to test the design at all possible four combinations of inputs i1 and i2.

Please note that in the original code, the delay of 1 time unit after assigning values to 'o' and before displaying the output was not included. This was added in the modified code to ensure the simulation reflects the timing aspect of the module. As a result, the test results printed in the Waveform window will be more accurate.

Remember to add `$dumpfile("contres_dump.vcd");` at the beginning of your Verilog design to write the contents to a dump file.

`$dumpvars(0,module_name);` is used to write all variables of the module.

`$dumpoff;` and `$dumpon;` can be used to turn off and turn on the dumping of the signals in the simulation. 

These statements must be included at the beginning and end of your Verilog test bench to create a properly dumped file.

For example:
```verilog
`
