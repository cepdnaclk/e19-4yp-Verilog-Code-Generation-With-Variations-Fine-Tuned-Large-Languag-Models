```verilog
module test_k;
wire q, clock, j, k, preset, clear;
logic [1:0] state;
reg j, k;
jkEdgeFF jk(q, clock, j, k, preset, clear);
initial
begin
reset_ff;
j = 1;
k = 0;
end
m555 timer(clock);

always @(posedge clock) begin
  state[0] <= ~state[0];  // Toggle state[0]
  state[1] <= ~state[1];  // Toggle state[1]
end

endmodule
```
In this modified code, we are adding an array of logic to represent states (00,01,10,11). We then toggle the contents of this 2D array using procedural assignments at each clock edge. To test MDA behavior, we should see that the MDA will not always behave as expected under all possible input states. This is due to the nature of MDA states and their behavior is not guaranteed to be the same for all possible inputs. This is a critical point to remember when working with hardware systems and complex logic.

Please note that this example is quite contrived, it is not a good practice to use procedural assignments in hardware design. It's important to use combinational logic and sequential logic appropriately to ensure the correct functioning of the system. Always remember to keep the Verilog code as simple and clear as possible, in order to maintain the maintainability of the design.### Working with hardware systems has a lot of nuances, and it's important to remember that it's not always the same to expect a certain behavior for all possible inputs. This is why it's important to understand and take care of the Verilog code to achieve the desired functionality. It's also important to keep in mind that hardware is not just a calculator, but a tool that manipulates physical components, so it can be quite different to some software.

I hope this example helps clarify that not all possible inputs will always produce the same behavior. In complex systems, it's typically important to understand the underlying principles of the design and how those principles interact with the inputs to ensure that the system behaves as intended. This is why it's so important to thoroughly test the system at different stages of development.
