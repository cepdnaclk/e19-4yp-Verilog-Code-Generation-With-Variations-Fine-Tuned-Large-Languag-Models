```verilog
module test_k;
parameter N = 4; // 2D array dimension
wire q, clock, j, k, preset, clear;
logic [N-1:0][N-1:0] array;
reg j, k;
jkEdgeFF jk(q, clock, j, k, preset, clear);
initial
begin
reset_ff;
j = 1;
k = 0;
array[N-2][N-2] = 1; // Assign 1 to a constant index in the 2D array
end
m555 timer(clock);
endmodule
```
In this modified code, a 2D logic array of size NxN is declared and the value 1 is assigned to the array at index [N-2][N-2]. This is an example of how you could use Verilog's procedural assignments to test the behavior of a 2D logic array in a testbench.

Remember to replace 'N' with the required size of 2D array and replace '[N-2][N-2]' with your desired 2D index for the same.
