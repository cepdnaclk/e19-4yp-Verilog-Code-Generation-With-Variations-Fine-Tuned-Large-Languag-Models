```Verilog
`timescale 1ns/100ps
module ALU8 (input [31:0] left, right, input [1:0] mode, output reg [31:0] ALUout);
always_comb begin
    case (mode)
        0: ALUout = left + right;
        1: ALUout = left - right;
        2: ALUout = left & right;
        3: ALUout = left | right;
        default: ALUout = 32'bX;
    endcase
end
endmodule
```
In modified code, we have extended the width of inputs and ALUout from 8 bits to 32 bits, as per your requirement. Note that this code is synthesizable and its behavior depends only on the inputs, meaning it doesn't change the operation of ALU8 module while simulating. The only difference is the variable width of operand and output. 

Also, the `always_comb` statement is used to specify the combinational logic of the module. This statement is commonly used when there is no clock or reset signal in your design.

The other code remains the same for the same functionality. The only change here is the width of the inputs and ALUout. This means the same operation is performed on 32-bit inputs instead of 8-bit inputs.

In your original code, the 8-bit width inputs were not used, and the width of the ALUout output was not changed with the input width. But, in the modified code, the ALUout output width is changed to 32 bits which was specified in the problem.

This modified version is synthesizable, and it remains the same for the same functionality. Therefore it is the recommended update.

Note: Be sure to include `input` and `output` ports in your Verilog module definitions. This ensures that the module is known by the Verilog simulator or synthesis tool. Also make sure to declare the output variable `ALUout` as a register `reg` to properly handle the assignment in case of asynchronous signals.

```Verilog
module ALU8_tb ();
