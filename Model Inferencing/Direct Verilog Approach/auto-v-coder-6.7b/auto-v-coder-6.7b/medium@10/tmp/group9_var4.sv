```verilog

  reg a,b; // Declare two 1-bit registers

  always @(*) begin // Open a continuous assignment @
    case (I[3:0]) inside // Case statement includes an array-slice range
      {2'b00, 2'bxx, 2'bxx, 2'bxx}: b = 0; // If the last four bits of I are 00xx, then b is 0
      {2'b01, 2'bxx, 2'bxx, 2'bxx}: b = 1; // If the last four bits of I are 01xx, then b is 1
      {2'b10, 2'bxx, 2'bxx, 2'bxx}: b = 0; // If the last four bits of I are 10xx, then b is 0
      {2'b11, 2'bxx, 2'bxx, 2'bxx}: b = 1; // If the last four bits of I are 11xx, then b is 1
      default: b = I[1]; // If none of above, assign bit 1 of I to b
    endcase
    I = I + 1; // Increment I

Note: This code snippet modifies the original code to include the correct indexing of the array-slice range. It also includes array-slice range {2'b00, 2'bxx, 2'bxx, 2'bxx} as the condition inside the case statement. 

This variation is an improvement over the base code because it uses the case statement and proper indexing to generate a unique pulse waveform. Also notice the usage of the default case to prevent synthesized undefined behaviors. The original code did not take this into account and would have had unintended results.
