```verilog
module tst_dff_p_b();
  reg di,clk; wire do;
  dff_p d1(do,di,clk); // Instantiate the DFF
  initial begin clk=0; di=1'b0; #35 $stop; end // Initialize & stop
  always #3 clk=~clk; // Generate clock
  always #5 di=~di; // Toggle data
  initial $display ("%m: Top-level testbench module"); // Display testbench name

  // Procedural assignment in initial block
  initial begin
    logic [1:0] array[10];
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) begin
      array[i] = i;
    end
    $display("Array values: %p", array);
  end
  initial $monitor($time," clk=%b, di=%b, do=%b",clk,di,do);
endmodule
```
This code creates an array of 10 logic elements. It then cycles through each element of the array and assigns it the value of its index. Finally, it displays the values of the array as well as the simulation of the clock.

Note: In this example, the array size is 10, and the values of the array are not used in the Verilog code, so the `$display` statement can be removed if not needed. The purpose of this code is to demonstrate the ability to create an array and populate it with procedural assignment within a Verilog module. The array size can be modified according to the needs of the simulation.

Please, remember to replace `dff_p` with the correct name of your DFF module. Also, the DFF must have 2 inputs and 1 output. The code provided assumes that this is the case. If your DFF has more or lower inputs/outputs, you will need to adjust the code accordingly.

If you want to observe the functionality of this code just run the simulation in your simulator tool. This Verilog code is not synthesizable and is only for educational purposes. It has to be used with a Verilog simulator like ModelSim or GTKWave.
