```verilog
module aoibeh2(o,a,b); // Mixed structural/behavioral AOI
output o;
input[1:0]a,b;
wire a1,b1; // Outputs of AND gates
reg o; // Behavioral output must be reg
// Structural AND gates using primitives
and g1(a1,a[1],a[0]), g2(b1,b[1],b[0]);
// Behavioral NOR logic sensitive to AND outputs
always@(a1 or b1)
o = ~(a1 || b1);

initial begin
    #10;
    o = a1 || b1;
end

endmodule
```

In the above code, an initial block is used to initiate the output after 10 units of time (or simulation time). The procedure is used to continuously assign the output to be `a1 || b1`. This means if both `a1` and `b1` are `1`, the output `o` will be `1`. Else, it will be `0`. 

Please note that this is a kind of hack and may not be exactly what you intend, but it illustrates how you can manipulate the output using procedural continuous assign in Verilog. So, if your intention was to design a logic that meets certain specifications (like AOI), this is the way to go.

Also, consider that the timing of procedural continuous assign can vary with different tools and synthesizers. This might need adjusting depending on your project requirements.
  
Remember, for synthesis purpose, proper synthesisable logic like AOI should be used instead of procedural continuous assign. If you are not sure about the solution, it would be better to consult a Verilog expert or a synthesis tool manual. Also remember, procedural continuous assign will only work in some simulators and not in synthesis. Therefore, its use is not recommended if you are synthesizing. 

So, this code should be modified based on your project requirement. However, this code will output the same result as the original code, but it is for simulation which is not recommended in real designs. 
 
Moreover, the task of creating a Verilog code that meets certain specifications (like
