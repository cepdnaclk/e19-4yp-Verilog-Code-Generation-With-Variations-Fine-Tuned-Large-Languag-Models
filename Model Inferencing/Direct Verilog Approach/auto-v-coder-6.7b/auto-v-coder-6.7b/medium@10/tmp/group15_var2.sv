### Explanation:
The "always_comb" keyword creates a block of combinational logic that is optimized for use with always blocks. It is similar to the "always @*" construct except that it synthesizes to a combinational logic block for synthesis and to a latch-based model for simulation. The "always_comb" statement synthesizes combinational logic to an equivalent netlist using combinatorial logic cells rather than latches. 

When used with an array part-select as an operand, the array part-select performs the equivalent function to that of a netlist assignment with an array part-select. In this case, the array part-select performs the desired operation (addition, subtraction, bitwise AND, or bitwise OR) when the mode input changes. 

In this variation, every time the mode input changes, the corresponding operation is done on the left and right inputs and the result is assigned to the ALUout output. This ensures that the ALUout output always reflects the result of the selected operation, regardless of the mode value. 

This variation helps to achieve the intended functionality of the ALU, with minimum simulation overhead.### `timescale 1ns/100ps
