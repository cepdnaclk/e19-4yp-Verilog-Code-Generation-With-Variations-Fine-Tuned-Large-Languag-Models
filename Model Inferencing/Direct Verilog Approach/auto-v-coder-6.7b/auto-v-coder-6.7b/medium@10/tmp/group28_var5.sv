```verilog
module aoibeh2(o,a,b);
output o;
input[1:0]a,b;
wire a1,b1; 
reg o; 

// Structural AND gates using primitives
and g1(a1,a[1],a[0]), g2(b1,b[1],b[0]);

// Behavioral NOR logic sensitive to AND outputs
always@(a1 or b1)
o = ~(a1 || b1);

initial 
begin
    #1; // Wait 1 timeunit before checking output to prevent race condition
    assert (o === (~(a1 || b1))) 
    $display("Output is correct: o = %b", o);
    else 
    $display("Output is incorrect: o = %b", o);
end
endmodule
```

The added initial block will help checking the behavior of the logic at the end of the simulation. This helps to verify its operation. It's important to note that this is just a simple example and it does not cover all possible corner cases. This is just to give example and you might not need to add assertions like this in real projects. Instead, you should consider using formal verification tools to check the correctness of your design.

Also, please ensure that you have included the appropriate Verilog libraries and macros in your design as per your specific design. ### This code is assuming that you are using Verilog with a behavioral description. If you are using structural design, the Verilog code would be different and require different tools. 

The code snippets provided here are also simplified and not fully functional. In a real-world scenario, you would need to include the necessary modules, interfaces, and connections to create a fully functional Verilog design. 

Also, the Verilog code here is written for synthesis. For simulation, you might need to add some more code. You can use tools like ModelSim to simulate and verify the code. ### Always remember to always test your design thoroughly to ensure it is working as expected. You can also use formal verification tools to check the correctness of your design, but these are more complex and time-consuming processes. 

Remember, Verilog is a hardware description language created
