```verilog

always @(posedge Clk) begin
    if(Reset) begin 
        Count <= 0; 
    end

        {Count, Count[0]} <= {Count[3:1], Count[0]};

This modified code creates a "2-bit shift register" using the left shift operation (<< 1) and the right shift operation (>> 1) in verilog. It essentially rotates the Count vector to the right by one bit position. Therefore, the least significant bit is shifted to the most significant bit and the bit furthest to the left (bit 0) is carried over.

In simpler terms, using the left shift operation, it performs the equivalent of the shift operation that would be done in hardware where a bit is shifted out the MSB and a bit is shifted in from the LSB.

The right shift operation is the same as the left shift but the bits are shifted in the other direction. The assignment to Count uses the packed array assignment, so the entire vector is assigned in one statement. 

Remember, Verilog is a hardware description language, which means the result of the procedural assignment will not be synthesizable or testable in a hardware environment. As a simulation language, it supports procedural statements to be used for simulation and debugging. 

Also, keep in mind that with the advent of SystemVerilog, the Verilog language has been updated to include procedural assignments inside the always block. This is a procedural assignment at the top level in Verilog. This can be useful for debugging, and as a simulation tool, but it's best practice to avoid using procedural assignments in hardware designs.

If you need to shift bits in a way that's synthesizable, consider using Verilog's `for` loop or other SystemVerilog features. 

If you want to do a simple left shift, you can use the bitwise shift operator <<. For example, `Count[3:1]` shifts to the left by one position and `Count[0]` remains the
