```verilog
// Single-bit D Flip-Flop with case statement
module dff(do,di,clk);
output reg do;
input di,clk;
initial do = 1'b0;
always@(negedge clk) begin // On negative clock edge
   case({di}) inside  // Using {di} to match 1-bit input
      [1]: do = 1'b1; // If 'di' is 1, make 'do' is 1
      default: do = 1'b0; // If 'di' is 0, make 'do' is 0
   endcase
end
endmodule
```
In the above code, `do` is a register type output. The input `di` is connected to array `{di}` to match a single-bit input. The case statement matches the values of `di` and assigns the output accordingly. It can be further extended to more complex situations. Please note that Verilog does not support `case` with an array operand on the left-hand side of the `inside` keyword. It only supports the right-hand side.### Variation of the Code:

This code is based on an input array, here `di` with n bits, and a case statement is applied to the array to generate the output. The case statement is used to map each possible n-bit state of the input array to the corresponding output array.

```verilog
module dff(do,di,clk);
output reg [n-1:0] do;
input [n-1:0] di;
input clk;
initial do = 1;
always @(negedge clk) begin
   case (di) inside
      default: do = di; 
   endcase
end
endmodule
```
In this code, the input `di` is an array with `n` bits and the output `do` is also an array with `n` bits. The case statement `inside` is used to map each possible `n-bit` state of the input `di` to the corresponding output `do`. If the input array `di` does not match any case in the case statement, the default case is used, which simply assigns `do` as the same as `di`
