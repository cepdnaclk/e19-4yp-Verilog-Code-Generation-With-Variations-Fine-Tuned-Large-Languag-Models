```verilog
module aoibeh2(
    output reg o,
    input [1:0] a,
    input [1:0] b
); // Mixed structural/behavioral AOI

reg a1, b1; // Behavioral output
reg [1:0] i; // Inputs

always@(*) begin
    i = {a, b};
    a1 = i[1] && i[0];
    b1 = i[3] && i[2];
    o = ~(a1 || b1);
end

endmodule
```

The Verilog code above declares two behavioral logic gates (`a1` and `b1`) and a behavioral output (`o`). The `i` register is used to create the "inputs" to our logic. The `a1` and `b1` are assigned the AND result of their respective inputs. The `o` output is then assigned to be the NOR of `a1` and `b1`.

The `always@(*)` block will execute whenever any input changes. 

We are using packed vectors which would be easier to handle when we need to make this more generic. The `a` and `b` inputs are packed into a single 2-bit vector, where the most significant bit of `a` is linked with the least significant bit of `b`. This is a simple way to connect the outputs of two logic blocks to the inputs of another logic block.

This version is more "Verilog-like" than the first version. It uses a procedural continuous assign (`always@(*)`) to handle the logic and input assignments. It uses packed vectors to represent the inputs and logic gates. This version is a bit more generic and it can be modified to handle different sized inputs as well. However, please note that this version might require an additional clock signal to be handled. This is because the procedural continuous assign will not work without one. It's also worth noting that it might be worth considering using a library function or macro to simplify the code or keep it more "Verilog-like". In general, it's a good idea to use library functions whenever they are available and they will often make your code easier to read and understand. This specific example doesn
