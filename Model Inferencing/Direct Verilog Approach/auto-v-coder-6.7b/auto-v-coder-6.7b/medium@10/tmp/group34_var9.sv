In this modified code, we have also added select line to select the operation to be performed. It will select the corresponding output from the gate after the priority is applied.

The priority case statement inside the always block will determine which gate's output will be assigned to ld based on the condition in the select line. If select is [0:0], ld will be assigned the value from or4. If select is [0:1], it will be assigned the value from and4, and if select is [0:2], it will be assigned the value from xor4. 

This is a relatively simple variation, but it does introduce a
