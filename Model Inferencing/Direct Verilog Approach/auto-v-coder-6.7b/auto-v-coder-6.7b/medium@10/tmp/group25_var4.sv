          2'b10: f | x3;

This code modifies the original code by adding a case statement into the always block. The case statement selects an element from the array based on the dynamic input x3, and uses this selected element to assign to the output g. The x3 is used to select the control flow and hence the output 'g' is either the result of 'f' (in case x3 is 0 or 1) or the bitwise not of 'f' (in case x3 is 2 or 3). This code can handle all possible combinations of the inputs, and hence is a more general solution to the original problem.

It's important to note that this code uses a case statement with a dynamic index, which is not a standard verilog feature. It's using a case statement inside an always block to drive the output g. The case expression selects among four possible values: x3 = 00 (f), x3 = 01 (~f), x3 = 10 (f | x3), and x3 = 11 (~(f | x3)). This can be seen as a switch-case statement in other programming languages with a dynamic selector value.

Please note that Verilog does not support dynamic indexing inside case statements. The expression inside case can be a constant or a range of constants, and cannot be an expression that can be evaluated at compile time, like in the example above. But, it should be noted that the output of the case expression 'g' is indeed driven by dynamic inputs x1, x2, and x3. It can be rewritten as follows:
```
always @(posedge Clock)
begin
    f = x1 & x2;
    g = (x3 == 2
