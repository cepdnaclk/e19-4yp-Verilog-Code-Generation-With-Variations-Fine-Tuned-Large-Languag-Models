```verilog
module nil;
reg [15:0] arr;
always @(*) begin
    if (arr[2:0] == 3'b000) begin
      // Code to execute
    end else begin
      // Other code to execute
    end
end
initial begin
    arr = 16'b0000;
    // Display the initial value of arr[2:0]
    $display("Initial arr[2:0] = %b", arr[2:0]);
    // Adding additional display for time
    $display("t=%0t display: arr[2:0] = %b", $time, arr[2:0]);
end
initial begin
    $monitor("t=%0t monitor: arr[2:0] = %b", $time, arr[2:0]);
    // Monitor triggers at t=0, t=2, t=5, t=6
end
endmodule
```

This code creates an array of 16 bits, `arr`. It then verifies the value of `arr[2:0]` and based on this condition, executes `begin` and `end` blocks. The `$display` and `$monitor` statements are used to display the values of `arr[2:0]` and also for showing the time at which these actions occur. The `$display` statement is placed inside the `begin` block, and the `$monitor` statement is placed outside the `begin` block. The `$monitor` statement is triggered during simulation. The `$monitor` statement is only executed in simulation, and it prints the value of `arr[2:0]` at the current time. The `$display` statement is executed at time 0, 2, 5, and 6. ### Note:

Be aware that the verilog model simulator doesn't have an option to display the system time at simulation start, so there's no initial time for these displays. 

Also, note that the `$monitor` statement is a non-blocking statement in verilog, so it will execute at each time step, not only at specific times, as the `$display` statement. Thus, in the above code, we get the output at each time step.
