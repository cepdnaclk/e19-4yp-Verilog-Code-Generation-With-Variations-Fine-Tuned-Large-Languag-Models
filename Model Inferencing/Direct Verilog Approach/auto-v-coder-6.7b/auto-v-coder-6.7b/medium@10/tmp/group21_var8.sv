This modified code uses a function to compute the index into the array. This is done in a way that aligns with the highest priority case from the input. The index thus selects the corresponding output from the instance of the NMOS inverter. The original function checks for each bit of the input until it finds the highest priority bit. If no bit is found, it returns `2'bzz`, which is U in binary, representing an undefined state.

Note: The array size is 4 as the input size is 4 bits. You can adjust the array size if the input size is different.

Please change the `NMOSinv` to your actual NMOS inverter module. This is just a placeholder. Also, the simulation will stop after 15ns. You can change this as per your requirements. For instance, the simulation time is 20ns in the above code. #20 can be changed to #100, #1000 etc to extend the
