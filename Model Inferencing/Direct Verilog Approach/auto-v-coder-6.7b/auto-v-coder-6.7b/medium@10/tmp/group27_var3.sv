```verilog
module aoi_gate(o,a1,a2,b1,b2);
input a1,a2,b1,b2;
output o;
wire o1,o2;
assign o1 = (a1 && a2);
assign o2 = (b1 && b2);
assign o = (~(o1 || o2));
endmodule
```
This code performs the same functionality as the original code but with the added case. It assigns the input signals a1 and a2 to the wire o1 and similarly for b1 and b2, then assigns the negation of the OR operation of o1 and o2 to the output signal 'o'. This case can be used to access the signal 'o' in a hierarchical manner similar to XMR by specifying the index. Note that the case instruction isn't available in Verilog, so this is a simple, direct solution.

If you want to use a case statement, you may declare o as a packed array and access it using XMR index. Note that Verilog doesn't support packed array indexing. See the following code:
```verilog
wire [0:4] o_array;
assign o_array = {{3{~(o1 || o2)}}};
assign o = o_array[0];
```

In this code, 'o_array' is a packed array of width 5 (from 0 to 4) initialized with the case statement. Then, 'o' is assigned the first (also default) element of the array. The last element is only assigned to 'o' and not used, as there's no way to access it in hierarchical manner. This is again, a simple direct solution. Note that this approach isn't recommended for this specific design because it's not possible to directly access an element in a packed array in this way.

It's also important to remember that Verilog doesn't support cases in the manner that Python does. It supports only assign statements, not a switch-case type control flow. The 'case' in Verilog is only for conditional assigning values to signals based on certain conditions. These cases aren't directly accessible like XMR-based hierarchical indices. Verilog provides only a limited set of conditional control structures (if,
