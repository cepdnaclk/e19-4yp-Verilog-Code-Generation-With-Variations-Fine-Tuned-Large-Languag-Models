```
module contres(o,i1,i2);
input i1,i2;
output o;
// Drive wire 'o' from two buffers with specified output strengths
buf(pull1, weak0) g1(o,i1); // Drives pull '1', weak '0'
buf(pull1, weak0) g2(o,i2); // Drives pull '1', weak '0'
// Resolution: 1,1->1; 1,0->1; 0,1->1; 0,0->0; 1,Z->1; 0,Z->X; Z,Z->Z
// Effective behavior is OR due to pull1 dominance over weak0

initial begin
   // Test if o is correctly resolved
   $display("Testing 'o' with i1=%d, i2=%d => o=%d", i1, i2, o);
end
endmodule
```
In this modified code, an `initial` block is added to the end of the `contres` module. This block is used to perform a test of the `o` output with a range of inputs. The `$display` function is used to print the test case to the console. This test case includes i1 and i2 as inputs, and o as the expected output. This block can be repeated for different inputs to thoroughly test the contres module.

Please note that the simulation will continue until the program is manually stopped, so running the simulation with multiple inputs might be a good way to ensure the module is behaving as intended. 

This modification is a simple way to verify the module's behavior, but it might not fully address the issue in a system design or test procedure. System designers would typically use formal verification tools and/or simulation to confirm that the module behaves as expected.ronyms and abbreviations:

    - buf: The Verilog `buf` primitive is equivalent to a buffer or inverter in digital logic.
    - buf(pull1, weak0): This specifies that the output strength of the buffer is '1' for the pull, and '0' for the weak.
