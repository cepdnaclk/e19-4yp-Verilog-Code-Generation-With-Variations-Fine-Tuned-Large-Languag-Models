```verilog
module aoi_gate(o,a,b);
input [3:0] a;
input [3:0] b;
output [3:0] o;
wire [3:0] o1,o2;

genvar i;
generate
    for(i=0; i<4; i=i+1) begin : GEN_BLOCK
        and gate1(o1[i],a[i],a[i+1]);
        and gate2(o2[i],b[i],b[i+1]);
    end
endgenerate

nor gate3(o,o1,o2);

endmodule
```
In this modified code, the original gate level connections are replaced with array-based instantiations. The resulting behavior will be an array of 4 output wires for each gate (`o1` and `o2`), each corresponding to the output of its respective gate instance.

Note: The generate statement and the for loop are Verilog-2001 features. Please replace the above code with equivalent Verilog-1995 code if you are using Verilog-1995.

Also, the modified code assumes that the inputs `a` and `b` are 4-bit wide. You may need to change the size of the inputs and outputs according to your requirements.

The XMR-based hierarchical indexing on the packed array has been removed for simplicity and clarity. Depending on your specific requirements, you may need to use XMR-based hierarchical indexing again.

This is a simple modification to the original code to accommodate Verilog-2001 features and add an array-based instantiation in place of the original gate level connections. This code is still a basic example and may not be the most efficient for large designs due to the use of loops and generate statements. Use this code as a starting point for your own Verilog design. If you want a more efficient design, you might consider using higher-level Verilog constructs like `always` blocks or use the `always_comb` and `always_ff` constructs to ensure your code is clean and efficient.
