```verilog
module tst_dff_p_b();
  reg di,clk; wire do;
  dff_p d1(do,di,clk); // Instantiate the DFF
  initial begin 
    clk=0; 
    di=1'b0; 
    #35 $stop; 
  end // Initialize & stop
  always #3 clk=~clk; // Generate clock
  always #5 di=~di; // Toggle data
  initial $display ("%m: Top-level testbench module"); // Display testbench name
  initial $monitor($time," clk=%b, di=%b, do=%b",clk,di,do);
  
  // Adding a procedural assignment for array indexing
  initial begin
    integer arr[3]; 
    arr[0] = 0;
    arr[1] = 1;
    arr[2] = 2;
    integer i;
    for (i = 0; i < 3; i++) begin
      di = arr[i];
      #10;
    end
  end
endmodule
```

In this code, a procedural assignment is added inside the initial block to initiate a procedural assign within initial block. This creates an array of integers, then loops through the array, assigning each number in the array to the di input of the DFF for one clock cycle at a time. This can be modified to fit your needs. This is just an example, and may not be what you need. Please remember to change the index of the array in the for loop according to your requirement. 

This code will not only display the value of the 'di' input at a certain time but also, in this case, the array 'arr' and it's assignments to 'di' input during the simulation. 

Remember, for larger designs, it's best to put logic in modules for better readability and maintainability. This is a simple example to show how to use procedural assignments within initial blocks. ### The purpose of this task is to show how to manipulate the testbench stimulus using procedural assignments in Verilog.
