```verilog

input wire [3:0] c,
input wire [1:0] s,

);

wire [3:0] sel;
wire [3:0] d = {~s[1] & ~s[0], ~s[1] & s[0], s[1] & ~s[0], s[1] & s[0]};

always @(*) begin
    case(d)
        4'b1111: sel = c[3];
        4'b1110: sel = c[2];
        4'b1101: sel = c[1];
        4'b1100: sel = c[0];

In the above code, a 4-bit signal `d` is created to store the value of `s`. This allows for the use of case statement without needing to create additional logic elements. 

A wire `sel` is declared to hold the selected value based on the select signals. 

The 'always @(*)' block is used to create a combinatorial circuit. In this block, a case statement is used to select the correct element from `c` based on `d`. 

The `assign` statement is used to assign the selected value to `z`. 

The selected value is stored in `sel`. Assigning this value to z will produce the same result as the original code, but the new code is more readable and easier to understand.
