```verilog
module pulses; // Corrected pulse generation
  reg [8:0] I;
  reg a,b;
  initial
    while (I<100) begin // Loop based on integer I
      b = I[1]; // Assign bit 1 of I to b (Corrected indexing)
      I = I + 1; // Increment I
    end
  initial I=0; // Initialize I
  initial begin
    #100 $stop; // Stop simulation after 100 time units
    $display("pulses module finished execution");
  end
endmodule
```
In the above, we've introduced a new block within the initial block for the simulation to stop and display the message when the simulation has completed. This modification is important to ensure that the simulation can be stopped without causing an error.### Correction Instructions:
The revised code correctly indexes the bits of each integer. The 1st bit of integer I is given to the b, and I is incremented in each simulation cycle. The simulation will stop after 100 time units.

Do note that the original code had the loop's condition I<100, but it was not used in the conditional block for incrementing the value of I. This has been corrected in the given code.

Also, as per the request, the code now has an initial block for the simulation stop and display message. This is important to ensure that the simulation can be stopped and an appropriate result is displayed even if the simulation was not properly terminated by the user.

Note: The purpose of creating this module is to illustrate how a simple simulation can be performed, such as a loop for a counter or the generation of a pulse. This example does not represent a typical application in Verilog, as Verilog is typically used for hardware design and synthesis. For real-world applications, you would likely want to use more robust simulation techniques.􏰄􏰑􏰁􏰅􏰄􏰌􏰆􏰒􏰑􏰀􏰋􏰉􏰈􏰄􏰆􏰅􏰄􏰌􏰆�
