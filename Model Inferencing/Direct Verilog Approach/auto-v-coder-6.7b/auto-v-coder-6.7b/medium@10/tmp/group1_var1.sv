```verilog
timescale 1ns/100ps
module ShiftRegister8 (input sl, sr, clk, input [7:0] ParIn, input [1:0] m, output reg [7:0] ParOut);
always @(negedge clk) begin
    case (m)
        0: ParOut <= ParOut;
        1: ParOut <= {sl, ParOut[7:1]};
        2: ParOut <= {ParOut[6:0], sr};
        3: ParOut <= ParIn;
        default: ParOut <= {ParOut[7:1],sl, sr};
    endcase
end
endmodule
```
### Explanation:
The variation code extends the case statement by adding a default case that shifts the bits in the register towards the middle of the bit-range, with the leftmost and rightmost bits of the input signal `ParOut` selected. This variation can effectively implement a shift-left, shift-right, and load operation on the 8-bit shift register.

You may replace the `default` case with any other shift pattern you prefer based on your specific task requirements.

Remember that you should check the timing of the flip-flops in your design. It's common to see some clock-to-data delay, and sometimes we want to ensure that the shifting occurs on the rising edge of the clock.

Also please note that the simulation results can be different from actual hardware implementation as the behaviour can change based on the synthesis tool used. ### Implementation:
This code can be implemented in any hardware design, but for a simulation, you can use the Verilog simulator (like ModelSim or Synopsys VCS) to create a testbench to test the shift register. ### Testbench Code:
```verilog
`timescale 1ns / 1ps

module tb_ShiftRegister8;

reg clk, sl, sr;
reg [1:0] m;
reg [7:0] ParIn;
wire [7:0] ParOut;
