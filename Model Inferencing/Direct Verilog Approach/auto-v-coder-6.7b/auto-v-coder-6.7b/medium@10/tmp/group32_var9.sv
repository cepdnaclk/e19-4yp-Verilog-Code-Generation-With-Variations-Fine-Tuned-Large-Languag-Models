This code introduces the case statement with a hierarchical index and uses the constant range list `{do[3:1], do[0]}` to select the bits of the `do` signal as the index. The case statement then assigns the input `di` to the output `do` based on the selected bits. Inside each case statement, `do` is assigned the value of `di`, so the output will always be equal to the input.

Note: This code is a simple example of a D Flip-Flop with case statement. It's also worth noting that the hierarchical index inside the `case` statement doesn't need to be the same as the output `do`. It's just used here for illustration purposes. The hierarchical index can be any way you want to slice and select the bits from a signal. In this case, `do[3:1], do[0]` is used to select 4 bits from the `do` signal. In a real design, you might want to use a different way to select bits based on your specific requirement. 
This is just a simple demonstration code and the actual implementation can be changed based on specific requirements. For instance, you might want to use different bits or different constants for selecting the bits or use different conditions inside the case statement.
Also, the number of cases can be adjusted based on your specific requirements. In this code
