```verilog
function int random_number;
  input int delay;
  begin
    if (delay < 0)
      random_number = 0;
    else
      random_number = $urandom_range(delay, 0);
  end
endfunction

module clock_gen_forever; // Renamed module for clarity
  reg clk, en;
  int delay = 20; // Example delay
  // Generate clock using forever loop, controlled by 'en'
  always @(posedge en) // Start clock generation on posedge en
    forever #(random_number(delay)) clk = ~clk; // Toggle clock within a random range of delay
  initial
  begin
    clk = 1'b0; // Initialize clock
    en = 1'b0; // Start disabled
  end
  initial $monitor("clk=%b, t=%0d, en=%b ", clk,$time,en);
endmodule
```
In this modified code, we introduce a function `random_number(delay)` which returns a random number within the range of delay. The `#(random_number(delay))` syntax is used to delay the clk assignment by a random number of units. This can be adjusted according to the desired delay range.###

Note: Verilog does not have a direct way to generate random delays with `#delay`, which is why the `$urandom_range` function is used. The `$urandom_range` function returns a non-negative integer value within the specified range. The value used in `$urandom_range` will have a uniform distribution in the range. The delay is then set to this value. The delay is not guaranteed to be exactly `delay`, it will be within the range `[delay,0]`.

Also note that the `forever` keyword is used to infinite loop, so the simulation will not terminate unless some other condition (like `$finish`) is met. This is to ensure that the clock generation logic will run indefinitely until the simulation is manually stopped, as there is no other control over the clock generation logic or the external logic that might require the clock to terminate.

The `initial $monitor` is used to print the values of `clk`
