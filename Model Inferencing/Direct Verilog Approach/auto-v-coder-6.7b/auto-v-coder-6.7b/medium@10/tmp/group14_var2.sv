```verilog
module mux21b (
input wire [1:0] a,
input wire [1:0] b,
input wire s,
output reg [1:0] y 
);
always @(*) begin
case(s)
0: y = a;
1: y = b;
default: y = 2'bxx; // x can be anything
endcase
end
endmodule
```
This modified code will select a from the first operand array and select b from the second operand array based on the value of "s". If the s value is anything other than 0 or 1, the output will be 'x' (or any other undefined logic value) in this case. Remember to change "2'bxx" to "2'bZ" for synthesis if your synthesis tool doesn't support 'x' as an undefined logic value.

Note: Priority case structures only work for one-hot encoded signals. If you want to make it work on a 2-input signal (i.e., with two bits), you must use a case statement.

Remember to adjust your synthesis tool's settings if you choose to use 'x' as an undefined state. For example, if you are using Xilinx ISE and want to use 'x' as an undefined state, you would need to define the value of 'x' to be 'Z' in the Xilinx ISE project properties.

Also, the number of inputs can vary depending on how many different inputs you have to handle at once. This simple mux design is good for a binary (0 or 1) input, but if you need to handle 4 inputs at once, you would need a more complex design with different case statements, and so on.

Lastly, the Verilog language and the specific tool used to synthesize the code should be specified for a more accurate answer.```verilog
module mux21b(
input wire [1:0] a,
input wire [1:0] b,
input wire s,
output reg [1:0] y
);

always @(*) begin
case(s)
0: y = a;
1: y = b;
default: y = 2'bx;
endcase
end
endmodule
