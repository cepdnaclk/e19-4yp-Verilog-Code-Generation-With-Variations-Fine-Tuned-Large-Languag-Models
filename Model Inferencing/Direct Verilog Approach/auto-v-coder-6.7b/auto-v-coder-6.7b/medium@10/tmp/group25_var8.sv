In the above modified code, the dynamic variable "i" is used to select a case in the case statement. Depending on the value of "i", the outputs f and g will be assigned new values. The value of "i" is set to 2, so the code will execute the third case when the "i" value is 2.### Note:

The code is a demonstration to illustrate dynamic variable indexing usage in case statements.

In actual application, using a dynamic variable might be a bad practice as it can lead to unpredictable behaviors especially in asynchronous systems. It's always recommended to use constant indexes in case statements for clarity and robustness. In the given code, the case statement is not used in actual implementation but just to demonstrate the idea of using dynamic variable indexing in case statements.### This design is an example of a clocked flip-flop in a Verilog design, where an input signal (`Clock`) determines the output value (`f`). The output signal (`g`) is the result of an OR operation between `f` and `x3`. The input signal `x1` is AND-ed with `x2` and the result is assigned to `f`. If any of the inputs change, the outputs will be updated at the next clock edge. In this case, `x1`
