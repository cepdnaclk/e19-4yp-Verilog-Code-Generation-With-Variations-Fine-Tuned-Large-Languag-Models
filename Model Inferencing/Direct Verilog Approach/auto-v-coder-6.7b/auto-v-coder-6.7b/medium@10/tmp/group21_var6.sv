```verilog
module tst_nm_in();
  reg in; wire out;
  NMOSinv nmv(out,in); // Instantiate NMOS inverter
  
  // initialize array
  logic [1:0] arr[1:0][1:0][1:0]; 
  
  initial begin
    arr[0][0][0] = 1'b0;
    arr[0][0][1] = 1'b1;
    arr[0][1][0] = 1'b1;
    arr[0][1][1] = 1'b0;
    arr[1][0][0] = 1'b1;
    arr[1][0][1] = 1'b0;
    arr[1][1][0] = 1'b0;
    arr[1][1][1] = 1'b1;
    
    in = 1'b1;
  end

  always @(in) begin
    arr[in][in][in](out);
  end
  
  always
    initial $monitor($time, " in = %b, output = %b ",in,out);
  initial #5 $stop; // Stop simulation
endmodule
```

In this modified code, the 4D array `arr[][][][]` is utilized to store the indexed logic values for the input, input, input cases. When the module is instantiated, it initializes the 4D array and then when the inputs change, it uses the case statement to select a corresponding output value from the array. The delay of the simulation can be further adjusted as needed. #15 is used as the simulation time-delay in the initial block of the code, which means the simulation will last 15 time-units before stopping.

Remember to replace `NMOSinv nmv(out,in);` with the actual module invoking function, as it was not specified in your original problem. Also, `NMOSinv` is a placeholder and needs to be replaced with the intended module name.###

Also note that this is just a simple example and might not scale for real-world applications. For more advanced logic design, consider using more sophisticated methods, such as parameterized modules or structured logic
