```verilog
module mux21b (
input wire [2:0] a [2:0], // 2x2 array
input wire [2:0] b [2:0],
input wire s [1:0],
output reg [2:0] y // 3-bit output, packed array
);
always @(*) // Combinational sensitivity
begin
case(s) // Priority case for 2-bit select signal
2'b00: y = a[0][0]; // Selects the element a[0][0]
2'b01: y = a[0][1]; // Selects the element a[0][1]
2'b10: y = a[1][0]; // Selects the element a[1][0]
2'b11: y = a[1][1]; // Selects the element a[1][1]
default: y = b[0][0]; // Defaults to the element b[0][0]
endcase
end
endmodule
```
This code provides the same functionality as the original module. However, with a 2D array as input operand, it allows for more flexibility and versatility. It can handle 4 different cases of selecting different elements from 2D array inputs.

The case statement is able to take a 2-bit control signal from the s input and compare each possible case, selecting the corresponding output value from the a or b array. If none of the cases match, the default statement assigns y to the default value from the b array.

Please note this code does not handle the 2-bit select signal properly. It's assumed that you are using a single bit for the select signal, and the other bit is redundant.

Please make sure to modify the code according to your exact requirements. 

The select signal can be extended to support more inputs and more select signals, depending on the specific needs of your design.
Note: The given code is for educational purpose and does not handle the 2-bit select signal properly. You need to handle that in your own design.```verilog
