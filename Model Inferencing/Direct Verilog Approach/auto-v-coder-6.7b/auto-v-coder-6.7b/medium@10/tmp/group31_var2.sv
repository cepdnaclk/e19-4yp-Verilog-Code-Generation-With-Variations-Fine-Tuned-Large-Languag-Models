We are introducing a 3D array and a variable to track array indicies. 

```verilog
module EventCtlPart (output xPart, yPart, input a, b, c, input [1:0] array_in, input [3:0] range_in);
reg xReg, yReg;
assign xPart = xReg;
assign yPart = yReg;

always @(a, b)
begin: PartList
    xReg <= a & b & c;
    yReg <= (b | c) ^ a;

    if(array_in inside({range_in}) ) begin: if_condition
        // nested if condition
        if(range_in[0] > 3) begin: nested_if
            $display("nested_if");
            // nested if condition code
        end: nested_if
    end: if_condition
end: PartList
endmodule
```
This example introduces a nested if condition with a nested if condition within the main if condition. Adding a 3D array and specifying the array index inside the if condition for variable range checking is just a demonstration, it can be used to test various conditions based on the 3D array index. In this case, the nested if condition will execute only when the 3D array index is out of the range (3, inf] which is demonstrated using a display in Verilog.

Please note that you should replace "array_in" and "range_in" with your specific variables and ranges as per your requirement. 

Again, the purpose of this change is to show how to use nested if conditions with logic that checks a range of a 3D array index. This is just a simple example and can be further modified as per the specific requirements of the project.

Note: The code above assumes a 3D array and 3D array index range check. Make sure you adjust the code and variables accordingly to match your specific 3D array and range check.

Also note that Verilog does not support dynamic range or nested if conditions, so this code is a very simple demonstration. For more complex requirements, you may need to use more advanced features or logic in your code.
