```verilog
module mux21b (
input wire [1:0][1:0] a,
input wire [1:0][1:0] b,
input wire [1:0] s,
output reg y // Output must be reg for procedural assignment
);
always @(*) // Combinational sensitivity
begin
case(s)
2'b00: y = a[0];
2'b01: y = a[1];
2'b10: y = b[0];
2'b11: y = b[1];
default: y = 0; // Default case
endcase
end
endmodule
```
In this variation, `a` and `b` are input as a 2D packed array, with each row representing an operand, and `s` is now also a 2D packed array. The case statement now takes a pair of bits as input. This will select a row from `a` or `b` based on the corresponding bits in `s`, and then select a column (bit) from the selected row. If `s` is not in the range of 4 possible states (00, 01, 10, 11), any arbitrary value can be assigned to `y`.

Notice that the output `y` is of a double-dimensional packed array, so the selected value from `a` or `b` will be of 2 bits each. If the input is of 1 bit, it should be declared as `output wire [1:0] y`. If the input is of 1 bit each, it should be declared as `output reg [1:0] y`. The syntax for packed array is `output wire [width-1:0] y`.

This code is a direct translation of Python code to Verilog. It may not be the most efficient way to do 2-input 2-bit mux in Verilog, but it is simple and self-contained. It also provides a way to represent a multi-dimensional structure in Verilog.
Keep in mind that the use of arrays in Verilog does not always mean the same as we do in Python. The number of dimensions is fixed at compile time and the size of each dimension is fixed at run time.
