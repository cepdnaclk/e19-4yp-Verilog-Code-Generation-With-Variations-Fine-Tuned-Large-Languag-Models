The new code adds a 3D array and checks for range inclusion using the `inside` keyword. This verilog code should not change the basic event control part behavior as it is not a suitable variation for this code. This example is just for demonstration and should be tested to see if it meets the requirements of your project.

Ensure to modify the 3D array and corresponding range checks according to your specific needs. If you need more complex behavior, consider exploring other Verilog features or programming approach to solve the problem in another way. 
This module should be synthesizable and should be tested thoroughly to ensure its behavior and functionality.

Remember this is just a simple demonstration and for more complex logic, additional modules and structural design should be considered. This code is intended to be illustrative and should be adapted to your specific project needs. 

Please note that the array ranges, the `inside` keyword, and the behavior might need revision based on your specific project requirements.

In general, programming solutions for Verilog can vary greatly depending on the specific problem at hand and the constraints of the design being implemented. This code should be taken as a simple illustration and the design
