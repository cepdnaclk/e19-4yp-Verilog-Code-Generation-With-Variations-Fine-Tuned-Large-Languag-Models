```verilog
module aoibeh2(o,a,b); // Mixed structural/behavioral AOI
output o;
input[1:0]a,b;
wire a1,b1; // Outputs of AND gates
reg o; // Behavioral output must be reg
wire [1:0] an;
// Structural AND gates using primitives
and g1(a1,a[1],a[0]), g2(b1,b[1],b[0]);
// Behavioral NOR logic sensitive to AND outputs
always@(a1 or b1)
o = ~(a1 || b1);

initial begin
an = {a1, b1};
$display("a1:%b b1:%b an:%b", a1, b1, an);
end
endmodule
```
With this code, you can see that the output of the aoibeh2 module is assigned as the result of the a1 or b1 expression. A procedural continuous assign block is used to print the intermediate values of the AND outputs for each input vector a and b. This block will allow you to observe the intermediate results of each condition that is being monitored.

Remember to observe the output waveform using a simulator tool such as Icarus Verilog or GTKWave for such a mixed structure-behavioral design.

Note: Be sure to understand the implications of this modified code, as behavioral continuous assign blocks can lead to unpredictable behavior in synthesis and timing simulation. If the code is synthesizable, this modification should not affect the output for any valid input; however, it can have a drastic impact on the timing of the design. This is an advanced topic and is not typically used in regular Verilog programming.```
