```verilog
module aoibeh2(o,a,b); // Mixed structural/behavioral AOI
output o;
input[1:0]a,b;
wire a1,b1; // Outputs of AND gates
reg o; // Behavioral output must be reg
// Structural AND gates using primitives
and g1(a1,a[1],a[0]), g2(b1,b[1],b[0]);
// Behavioral NOR logic sensitive to AND outputs
always@(a1 or b1)
o = ~(a1 || b1);

initial begin
  #5; // time delay for simulation
  o = (~a1 & ~b1); // procedural continuous assign
end
endmodule
```
In this variation, we added an initial block and a procedural continuous assign to the module. The procedural continuous assign will be evaluated after the initial block. It is important to note that due to the asynchronous nature of Verilog, the simulation may display unexpected results if the initial block with the procedural continuous assign is placed before the always block with the behavioral NOR logic. Therefore, the initial block should always be placed before other non-posedge-triggered blocks. Additionally, the procedural continuous assign will not influence the simulation at the point when it is placed because the simulation begins after the initial block. This way, we can see if the procedural continuous assign affects the simulation and the simulation results at the point of procedural continuous assign should be considered as a simulation result of the procedural continuous assign. As a result, you can use this technique to check the simulation results when the procedural continuous assign is used.### Wrapping Up:

This modified code demonstrates the use of an initial block with procedural continuous assign and the behavioral NOR logic within a mixed structural/behavioral AOI module. It provides a way to check behavioral logic and procedural continuous assign simultaneously in a Verilog design. It is important to remember that procedural continuous assigns should be used sparingly and judiciously to avoid unnecessary simulation results. This coding variation can be used in the simulation environment to verify if the procedural continuous assigns behaves as intended.

Also, keep in mind that the initial block with procedural continuous assign should come before
