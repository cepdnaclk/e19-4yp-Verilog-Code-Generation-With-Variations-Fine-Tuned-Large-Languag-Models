```
In the modified code, we have a function named function_return_array which returns an array of values. The always block is executed after every change to the input and it captures the first element of the returned array.

Please note that the function_return_array has an input parameter idx, but the code inside the always block doesn't use it because the design doesn't have any port for it. Also note that the design has an array named array1 and an array named array_out. The array1 is used inside the always block with one operand from the array_out array. The array_out is returned by the function function_return_array. The design also uses the default value array_out when the function is called.

The array can be modified with different array sizes and values, and the code will always reflect these changes.

Please ensure that the input to the function is correctly handled and the assignment of the function output to a wire y is correct based on whether array1 is an array or a single value.
