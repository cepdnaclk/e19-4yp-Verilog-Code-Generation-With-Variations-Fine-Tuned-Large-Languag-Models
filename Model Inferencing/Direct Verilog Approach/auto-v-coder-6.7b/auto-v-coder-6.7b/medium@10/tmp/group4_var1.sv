```verilog
module jkNMOS(d,j,k,qa); // JK Flip-flop NMOS
  output reg qa;
  input d,j,k;
  supply0 a; // Ground
  // Parallel NMOS transistors connect output to ground
  always @ (posedge a) begin
    case ({j,k})
      2'b10: qa <= ~qa;
      2'b11: qa <= 1'b0;
      2'b01: qa <= 1'b1;
      2'b00: qa <= d;
    endcase
  end
endmodule
```
In this version of the code, the "case" statement checks the value of the two input signals. If "j" is high and "k" is low, the output signal is inverted. If both "j" and "k" are high, the output is set to 0. If "j" is low and "k" is high, the output is set to 1. If "j" and "k" are both low, the output is set to the input signal "d". This modified code allows for the simulation of an edge triggered JK flip-flop using NMOS transistors. Note that the "always @ (posedge a)" block ensures that the case statement is evaluated on every positive edge of the "a" signal. ### Note: The modified code assumes that all inputs are active high. This means that the case statement handles high-true and low-false logic. If the inputs are active low, changes in the case statement should be accordingly made. ### Note: The above code assumes that inputs are changed only on positive edge of clk. If you need another type of triggering, you may need a different behavior in timing diagram. A simple way to do this could be using a flip-flop with synchronous reset and preset.
