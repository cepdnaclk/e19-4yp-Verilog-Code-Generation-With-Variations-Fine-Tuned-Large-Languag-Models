```verilog
module example5(x1, x2, x3, f);
input x1, x2, x3;
input [7:0] x;
output f;
reg f;
always @(x1 or x2 or x3 or x)
    if (x2 == 1)
        f = x1;
    else if (x[2:0] inside {8'h12, 8'h23, 8'h34})
        f = x[2:0];
    else
        f = x3;
endmodule
```
In the above code, if `x2` equals 1, the output `f` will be equal to `x1`; if the part-select of `x` is inside the fixed constant range `{8'h12, 8'h23, 8'h34}`, `f` will be equal to the part-select of `x`. Else, `f` is equal to `x3`.

This example demonstrates how to add more conditional logic to your Verilog code. This can be useful in cases where you want to select output based on the value of some inputs or the value of a specific part-select of a packed array.

Remember not to mix "if" with "inside", as it will generate a syntax error. The inside keyword is used with the "==" operator for comparison check with a range of values. In this case, `x[2:0]` is a part-select of `x`, and the condition is checking whether `x[2:0]` is inside the range of values `{8'h12, 8'h23, 8'h34}`. If it is, then `f` will be assigned the value of `x[2:0]`. If not, `f` will be assigned the value of `x3`.
