```verilog
module example6(x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, f);
input x1, x2, x3, x4, x5;
output f;
reg f;
wire [3:0] x_pack = {x5, x4, x3, x2, x1};
integer i;
always @(x_pack)
    for (i = 0; i <= 4; i++)
        if (x_pack[i:i] inside {[1:5]}) // check if any part-select in x_pack is within the range [1:5]
            f = 1;
        else
            f = 0;
endmodule
```
In this code, a packed array `x_pack` is created from the five inputs `x1, x2, x3, x4, x5`. Then, `f` will be set to 1 if any part-select of `x_pack` resides within the range [1:5] and it will be set to 0 otherwise. The test is done for every part-select in `x_pack`. The `inside` keyword checks if each part-select is within the range [1:5]. If any of them falls within the range, `f` is set to 1, otherwise it is 0.

Please note, the `inside` keyword is Verilog-2001 syntax. If Verilog-2001 compatibility is a concern, you should consider using a block that iterates over the range and checks each part-select manually.

Also note that this variation uses continuous assignments in the sensitivity list, which is not standard Verilog but common in some toolkits. Verilog-2001 suggests using a `case` statement or a `generate` block for better readability and consistency. However, continuous assignments in the sensitivity list are common in certain toolkits for compatibility.```verilog
