```verilog
module aoi2(g,a,b,c,d);
output g;
input a,b,c,d;
wire e,f,g1; // Intermediate signals
// Dataflow assignments for AND, OR, and NOT operations
assign e = a && b;
assign f = c && d;
assign g1 = e || f;
assign g = ~g1; // Final AOI output

initial begin
    $display("Initially, g = %b", g);
end

endmodule
```
In this example, the 'initial' block is used to set up initial conditions, like variables, constants, or any other code that should be executed before the main simulation process starts. It's followed by a '$display' command that logs the starting value of 'g' to the console.

When verifying the results, the '$display' command will output the resultant value of 'g' at the start of the simulation. This should provide a good indication of the value 'g' would be after the module is instantiated.

Make sure to run the simulation with this code to get the final value of 'g' at the start of the simulation.

Remember to replace 'g', 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd' with your actual signals or variables.

This is the base Verilog code and it doesn't require any change with the initial code variant. The only difference is the 'initial' block and the display statement, which is added for the purpose of displaying the initial value of 'g'.

The $display instruction should be used in Verilog to output the value of a variable. This is useful for debugging and checking the behavior of the design. 

While running the simulation, make sure to observe the output of 'g' at the start of the simulation as it will give you a good idea of what is the initial value of 'g'. If 'g' is the output of the AOI module, it indicates the initial state of the outputs based on the inputs. 

Also, note that the "initial" block is executed once at the start of the simulation, it's not executed multiple times for each clock cycle. This is why the outputs are only printed once at the start, not at each clock cycle.
