This code introduces a 4D array, which is simulated as a 4 sensors reading from a sensor_array module. The NMOSinv module processes the sensor data and outputs an array of 4 binary values. The code uses a 4-bit input to the NMOSinv module, representing the 4 binary values from the sensor_array module. The simulation time is extended to 10 clock cycles and then stopped.

Please note that the sensor_array is a mock-up and has no defined behavior. It should be replaced by the actual sensor data acquisition module in your design. The NMOSinv module is also a mock-up and should be replaced by the actual gate driver or inverter module in your design.

Also, the output of the NMOSinv module and the sensor data array are monitored in the $monitor statement in the always block. The # symbol is used to separate simulation time scales. In this case, the simulation runs for 10 clock cycles before stopping.

In the initial block, the reset signal is asserted for 2 clock cycles before
