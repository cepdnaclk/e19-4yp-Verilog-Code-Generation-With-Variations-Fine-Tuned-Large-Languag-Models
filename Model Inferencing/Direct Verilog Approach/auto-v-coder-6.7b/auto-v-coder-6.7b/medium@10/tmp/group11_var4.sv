```verilog
module aoi2(g,a,b,c,d);
output g;
input a,b,c,d;
wire e,f,g1; // Intermediate signals
reg [2:0] var;
// Dataflow assignments for AND, OR, and NOT operations
assign e = a && b;
assign f = c && d;
assign g1 = e || f;
assign g = ~g1; // Final AOI output
always @(*) begin
    var = {aoi2(1),aoi2(1),aoi2(1)};
end
function aoi2;
    input a;
    begin
        if (a == 1) return 1;
        else return 0;
    end
endfunction
endmodule
```
In this modified code, a function `aoi2` is used to initialize the `var` array with 3 copies of the function call. This function returns 1 if its input is 1, else it returns 0. The index in the initial block variable initialization `var` is determined by a function call `aoi2(1)`, which triggers the function to return 1. 

Please note that if you want to use `var[0]`, `var[1]`, or `var[2]` outside the module, you'll need to use the appropriate scope. This example assumes that the scope for the `var` variable is within the same module.

**Note:** This code is an example and may not work in other simulators or synthesis tools. You may need to adjust it as per your specific requirements. Also, it's important to note that the use of a function inside an initial block is a Verilog-2001 feature and may not work with all simulators or synthesis tools. Some tools may not support this usage.
  
If you want to apply the logic inside a function and then use it as an assignment to a variable, then you have to define a module-level task or function. However, keep in mind that using a function or task inside a module means that you're defining a function or task that you'll be able to call with a syntax similar to a Verilog module instance. That means that you can't use a function or task
