```verilog
module mux21b (
input wire [1:0] s,
input wire [15:0] operand,
output reg y );
always @(*) begin
case (s)
2'b00: y = operand[2];
2'b01: y = operand[3];
2'b10: y = operand[4];
2'b11: y = operand[5];
default: y = 0;  // Default value for the cases not covered
endcase
end
endmodule
```
In this code, the 2D array operand is represented as:

operand[2] = operand[0][1]

operand[3] = operand[0][2]

operand[4] = operand[1][0]

operand[5] = operand[1][1]

The mux21b module takes two inputs, s [1:0] and operand [15:0]. The case statement inside the always block matches the value of s and assigns the corresponding operand value to the output y. If the value of s is not covered by any case, the default statement is executed which assigns 0 to the output y. 

In this variation, we are not using any combinational logic involving inputs a, b or s. Instead we use a priority case construct with a packed 2D array as the operand, thus saving logic cells needed for the combinational logic. This will help in reducing the circuit area and speeding up the implementation. However, be aware that if the condition for s is changed or different behavior for default is desired, you can modify the case statement as per the need. ### Note: This variation modifies the input and output of the module to accommodate a packed 2D array operation. This needs the operand to be represented in the 2D array format specified. The exact structure of the 2D array will depend on the specifics of the problem to be solved. For instance, if the actual operation to be performed is matrix multiplication or array manipulation, then a proper representation of the operand array in terms of rows and columns will be necessary. This code is simplified for the sake of explaining the concept and should be adjusted according to the actual requirement. Happy
