The MDA can be any array that contains logic values representing each gate operation. 
```
module gates4_top (
input wire [3:0] sw,
output wire [2:0] ld,
input wire [4:0] mda
);
wire [3:0] and4, or4, xor4;
gates4 U1 // Assuming 'gates4' provides and4_, or4_, xor4_ outputs from input 'x'
(
.x(sw),
.and4_(and4),
.or4_(or4),
.xor4_(xor4)
);
wire [1:0] priority_index = mda[4:3];
always @(*) begin
    case (priority_index)
        2'b00: ld <= and4;  // Selecting AND operation
        2'b01: ld <= or4;   // Selecting OR operation
        2'b10: ld <= xor4;  // Selecting XOR operation
        2'b11: ld <= {and4[1],or4[1],xor4[1]}; // Combining AND, OR, and XOR outputs
        default: ld <= 3'b000;
    endcase
end
endmodule
```
In this code, the priority case assigns the ld wires depending on the value of the priority index `mda[4:3]`. If the priority index is `00`, it's representing the 'and4' operation; `01` for 'or4' operation, `10` for 'xor4' operation, and `11` for combining 'and4', 'or4', and 'xor4' outputs. Default case is for any other value of the index.

This way, we provide a way to select an arbitrary logic operation based on an MDA. The MDA can control which operation is performed. This can be made more complex as per the requirements.

Remember, you should connect the MDA input of your design with a constant value or an external control source. The constant value will determine which operation is performed.

The MDA should be connected to the gate module for the logic operations to be performed accordingly.
