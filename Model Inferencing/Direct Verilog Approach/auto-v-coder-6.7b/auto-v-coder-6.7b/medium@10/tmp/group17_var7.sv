```Verilog
module mux41b (
input wire [3:0] c,
input wire [1:0] s,
output wire z
);

assign z = c[s];  // select the element of c array at index s

endmodule
```
In the new variation, we're using the array indexing feature of Verilog to directly select elements from the 'c' array based on the values of's'. This is a cleaner and more simplistic way of selecting an element from the array based on a variable that varies based on some condition. This is a simpler method compared to using multiple OR conditions as in the original code. This variation also performs the same function, but is more straightforward and efficient.

Note: Make sure the array index selector (s) is within the range of the array. In the original code, the s[1] & s[0] is out of range for 4-bit array c. To fix this, we can use c[s[1]][s[0]] to get the value at the correct array index. However, this would make it a 2D mux rather than a 1D mux. Also, the new code assumes that the range of's' is from 0 to 3. If we need a different range, we need to adjust the range of the array index's' to fit our needs.

In this example, we created a 1D mux, hence's' is not used as 2D index for the array 'c'. If your array is 2D array and's' is 2D, use 'c[s[1]][s[0]]' instead.  This code also assumes that the ranges of's' and the indices of the array 'c' are the same and that's' is a 2D array of the same size as 'c'. The 1D version is simpler and more efficient. However, it's important to adapt the code based on your specific needs.#######.

Please be aware of the case-sensitivity in Verilog, since 'z' and 'Z' are not the same. Verilog is case-insensitive for variable and module names, but not for module parameters. 

To avoid confusion, always use the same case for your module parameters
