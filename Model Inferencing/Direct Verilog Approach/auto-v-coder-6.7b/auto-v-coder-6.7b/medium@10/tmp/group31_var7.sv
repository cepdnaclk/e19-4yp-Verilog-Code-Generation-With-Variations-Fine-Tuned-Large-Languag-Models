```verilog
module EventCtlPart (output xPart, yPart, input a, b, c);
reg xReg, yReg;
assign xPart = xReg;
assign yPart = yReg;
always @(a, b)
begin: PartList
    xReg <= a & b & c;
    yReg <= (b | c) ^ a;
end

reg [7:0] arr[2:0][2:0][2:0]; // Define 3D array

initial begin : initial_code
    arr[1][1][1] = 1; // Fill the middle of the array with 1
    arr[1][1][2] = 2;
    arr[2][1][1] = 3;
    arr[2][1][2] = 4;
end

always @(arr) begin // Test the array every time it changes
    if (a & b & c) begin // If all inputs are true
        if (arr[a][b][c]!= 0) begin // If the slice selected by the inputs is not zero
            $display("Array slice %h is not zero.", arr[a][b][c]); // Print a message
        end
    end
end
endmodule
```
In the modified code, a 3D array `arr` is created. The array is filled with a specific value on each index. Then, an `always` block is used to continuously check if the array slice selected by the input values is not zero. If it is zero, a message is printed.

Please note that Verilog does not have built-in support for arrays with more than 3 dimensions. This is a simplified example to demonstrate the concept. You should replace the 3D array with a 3D array you're using in your project. 

Also, be aware that the code uses a blocking assignment `arr[1][1][1] = 1;`. In Verilog, blocking assignments are evaluated immediately. This means the assignment `arr[1][1][1] = 1;` will be evaluated when the `initial begin : initial_code` block is executed. This could potentially be a problem if you're expecting the array to be populated asynchronously. If that behavior is undesired, consider using
