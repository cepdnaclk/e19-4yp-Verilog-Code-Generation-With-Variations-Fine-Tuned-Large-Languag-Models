In this code, the input values (left, right) are directly used for assignment to the output array without any array part-selects. The 'timescale' statement specifies the minimum unit and precision for time data.
The 'always_comb' block is used to create a combinational logic process where inputs will be evaluated (i.e., the block will trigger whenever an input to the logic changes).
Note: The input values (left, right) directly used for assignment to the output array without any array part-selects doesn't mean that these are combinational logic inputs. It means that these signals are not used as part of any logic in this design. If they were used as part of any logic, then the design would be non-combinational.
In modern Verilog, the use of 'always_comb' or 'always_ff' is recommended over the 'always' block for combinational or sequential logic, respectively. However, 'always' could be used in some specific cases. 
We should be careful with the 'always' block as it could create a timing path through the block, that could potentially delay the output signal.
The 'default' case in a 'case' statement in Verilog is required and needs to be completed. The 'default' case should be a valid operation, otherwise, it may lead to unpredictable output. 

Please remember that the above code does not account for all possible combinations of inputs, it is just an example. If your ALU includes more operations, you'll need to modify the `case` statement to include them.

Please note that these changes are only a suggested course of action, and the result might depend on the specific requirements of your design. Always test your design thoroughly before implementing it into a
