```Verilog
module mux21b_priority #(
parameter WIDTH = 2,
parameter DEPTH = 2
)(
input wire [WIDTH*DEPTH-1:0] a, // Input array of size 2D
input wire [DEPTH-1:0] s, // Select array of size 1D
output reg y // Output must be reg for procedural assignment
);
always @(*) // Combinational sensitivity
case (s)
default: y = a[1];
1: y = a[0];
endcase
endmodule
```
This modified code takes a 2D array `a` and a 1D array `s` as inputs. It uses a priority case structure to select the corresponding element from the 2D array, assigning it to the output `y`. 

The `WIDTH` and `DEPTH` parameters specify the size of the 2D array and 1D array respectively. They can be customized as per the need.

Note: Be cautious with changing the order of the array elements, as the order in the 2D array `a` may influence the selection process. The selection process is as follows:
 
- If `s` are set to 0, it will select the first element of the first row. 
- If `s` are set to 1, it will select the second element of the first row. 

This means, if the first element of the first row (`a[1]`) is desired to be selected, set `s` to 0 and vice versa. The selection can be modified according to the requirement. It is a demonstration of how you can use a priority case structure in a Verilog module for selecting the most appropriate input from an array of inputs.

Remember that Verilog is a hardware description language, it does not have a way of doing priority within an array.

Also, Verilog supports packed dimensions, where you can define dimensions using the same syntax as array dimensions, but these can be used in the expressions of the array range. 

For instance:
```Verilog
reg [3:0][7:0] a;
```
Here, each element in the array a is a 4-bit wide and 8-bit deep. So,
