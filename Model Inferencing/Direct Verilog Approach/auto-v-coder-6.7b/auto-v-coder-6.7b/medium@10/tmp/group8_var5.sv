Here, a `for` loop is used to check the outputs of the decoder for each possible input. If the `o` value at the index of the input is 1 (true) then the test is considered a pass, otherwise the test is considered a failure. This modification allows for additional checks beyond just the initial $monitor command. 
Please note that for each input, the test checks if the corresponding output is enabled (1). In other words, it checks if the `o` value at the index of the input is 1.

Also please note, if you wish to test the `en` signal, you need to update your module with `dec2_4beh dec(o,i,en)`, and set `en` high as the condition inside the `if`. 

Remember to compile the code and run it to validate the functionality. The `$time` keyword gives the time at which the simulation is currently running.### Note: 
This code checks each possible input and output combination of the decoder. It might take a while to run. Also, this code assumes that the decoder is only behaving as expected when `en` is high. If you have any more complicated behavior without enabling the decoder or for other cases where the output should be '0', you need to expand on this logic accordingly.

If the decoder has multiple outputs and you want to check for each output separately, you should also update the
