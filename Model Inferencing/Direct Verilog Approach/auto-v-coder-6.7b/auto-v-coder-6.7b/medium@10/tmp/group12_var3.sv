```
module maj3 (a, b, c, y);
input a, b, c;
output y;
reg [2:0] im;
assign im = 'b011;
or #(3, 5) (y, im[a], im[b], im[c]);
endmodule
```

This version does the same thing as the previous one, but it's more explicit about the `im` array being initialised to 011. The `assign` block is equivalent to the always block in the previous version. Note that the order of the inputs is altered here because the original always block was using the `and` and `or` blocks directly, which doesn't align with the original problem's operation. The inputs are all tied to the corresponding bits in the `im` array, and the result is then or'ed with the same array. This keeps the logic of the original code, but it'
