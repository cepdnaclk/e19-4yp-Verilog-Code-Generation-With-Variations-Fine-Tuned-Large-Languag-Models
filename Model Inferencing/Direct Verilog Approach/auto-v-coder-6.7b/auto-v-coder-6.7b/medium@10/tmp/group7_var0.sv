This code generates a test bench for the module `contres` that tests all possible inputs to see if the output of the module is as expected. It does this by sequentially testing all possible combinations of inputs to the module, checking the correctness of the output after each test. The test bench also ensures that the output is correctly driven by the module `contres` after each test. The test bench also checks for all possible combinations of the inputs to ensure that the module behaves as expected under all possible conditions. 

You can modify the test bench as per your requirements. For instance, you could add further test cases to test specific conditions or the output of the module against a known value. This code is a basic example and may need to
