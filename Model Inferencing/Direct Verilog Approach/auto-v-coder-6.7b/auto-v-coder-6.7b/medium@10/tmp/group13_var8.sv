```verilog
module tst_wand1; //testbench
reg i1, i2;
wire o; // Added wire declaration
wand1 ww(i1, i2, o);
integer i;
initial begin
i1 = 0; i2 = 0; // i1=0, i2=0 -> o=0
i = 1;
if(o == i2[i:i]) begin
    $display("Test passed!");
end else begin
    $display("Test failed.");
end
end
initial $monitor($time,"i1=%b,i2=%b,o=%b",i1,i2,o);
initial #8 $stop; // Added stop
endmodule
```
In the above code, if the output o is equal to the slice of the input i2 that starts at index i and ends at index i (which is always 0), then the test would pass. Otherwise, it would fail. This is an example of using Verilog's array slicing feature with an if statement.### Note:
This won't always pass due to the fact that the logic in the `wand1` module is not defined. However, the test passes or fails based on the expected output of the module under the given input conditions. In case of using multiple variables in the comparison, the loop is required. 

Also, you should add the following line in the beginning of the Verilog code to specify the range of the input i:
```verilog
parameter i = 0; // Specifying the range of the input
```
This is the minimum code to verify the functionality of the circuit under the given test conditions.
