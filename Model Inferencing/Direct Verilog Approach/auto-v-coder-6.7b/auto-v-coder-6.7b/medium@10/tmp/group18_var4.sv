```verilog
`timescale 1ns/100ps

module maj3_p (input a, b, c, output y);
  wire im1, im2, im3;
  parameter
      tplh1=2, tphl1=4,
      tplh2=3, tphl2=5;
  and #(tplh1, tphl1)
      (im1, a, b),
      (im2, b, c),
      (im3, c, a);
  or #(tplh2, tphl2) (y, im1, im2, im3);
endmodule
```
The base code is the same as the original one. This variation is only possible due to the way Verilog works. The `#()` operator is used to assign timing parameters to the primitive gates and can only be given numerical parameters. Therefore, changing the timing parameters inside an `always` block or inside function calls won't change the timing.

It would make more sense to assign these timing parameters outside of the module and use them as parameters inside the module. This would allow for more flexibility in setting timing, rather than hardcoding them inside the module.

```verilog
`timescale 1ns/100ps
module maj3_p (input a, b, c, output y);
  parameter
      tplh1=2, tphl1=4,
      tplh2=3, tphl2=5;
  and #(tplh1, tphl1)
      (im1, a, b),
      (im2, b, c),
      (im3, c, a);
  or #(tplh2, tphl2) (y, im1, im2, im3);
endmodule
```

This version of the code does not allow for the modification of timing parameters within the module. However, it's critical to understand that the delay parameters assigned to the gates are not allowed to change during the simulation. Please ensure you understand this and any changes you make to hardware-level timing constraints should be thoroughly verified.

Remember that Verilog does not support changing timing parameters based on the input/output values. It'
