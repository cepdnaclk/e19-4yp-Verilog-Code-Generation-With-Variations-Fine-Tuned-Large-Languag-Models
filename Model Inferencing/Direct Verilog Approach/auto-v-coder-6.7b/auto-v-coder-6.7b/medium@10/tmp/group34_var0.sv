In this case, the priority case will be applied to `ld[0]`, `ld[1]`, `ld[2]` based on the selection of `sw[3]`. 

```Verilog
module gates4_top (
input wire [3:0] sw,
output wire [2:0] ld
);

gates4 U1 // Assuming 'gates4' provides and4_, or4_, xor4_ outputs from input 'x'
(
.x(sw[3:0]),
.and4_(ld[2]),
.or4_(ld[1]),
.xor4_(ld[0])
);

always @(*) begin
  casez (sw[3])
    1'b0 : ld[0] = ~ld[0];
    1'b1 : ld[1] = ~ld[1];
    default : ld[2] = ~ld[2];
  endcase
end

endmodule
```
Please note that the `gates4` module is unprovided here, and so, the truth table can't be generated. Also, the casez statement is used to use the 'Z' value of the case items; it matches with the case when all the 'Z' input conditions are true. It's not necessary to use the `default` keyword in this case because the last two items are non-default.

This means, if `sw[3]` is true, `ld[2]` will be inverted, if `sw[3]` is false, `ld[0]` will be inverted. If neither `sw[3]` nor `sw[2]` are high, `ld[1]` will be inverted. If `sw[2]` is high, but `sw[3]` is low, it won't be inverted. Similarly, if `sw[2]` and `sw[3]` are both high, `ld[2]` will be inverted. 

This example illustrates how to create a priority case on multiple outputs of a module with two input conditions. This is a flexible way to implement a priority encoder in Verilog.

In general, this example applies the logic of the `
