```verilog
module maj3 (a, b, c, y);
input a, b, c;
output y;
reg im1, im2, im3;
always @(a or b or c) begin
    im1 = (a & b)[0];
    im2 = (b & c)[0];
    im3 = (c & a)[0];
end
assign y = (im1 | im2 | im3);
endmodule
```
The always block has a sensitivity list that changes the values of 'im1', 'im2', and 'im3' whenever 'a', 'b', or 'c' changes. The assignment statements in the always block set 'im1', 'im2', and 'im3' to the corresponding bit in the result of bitwise and operations between 'a', 'b', 'c', respectively.

The result is then assigned to 'y' using a simple bitwise or operation. This variation of the code should help to better demonstrate how to handle the task at hand. 

Remember to replace the sensitivity list with a more appropriate one according to your needs. In this example, a simple bitwise and operation is assumed because the bitwise operations are the same for every bit in the 'a', 'b', and 'c' inputs. Also, make sure to assign the values of 'a', 'b', and 'c' to the inputs of your design.

NOTE: This code might not be synthesizable because the or and and operations do not have specified delay. Please adjust the delays as per your requirement. These operators may not synthesize to the exact delay specified in the original code. Also, the use of always @(a or b or c) should be replaced with an appropriate sensitivity list according to the specifics of the design. For optimal synthesis results, consider using always @(posedge a or posedge b or posedge c).```verilog
module maj3 (a, b, c, y);
input a, b, c;
output y;
reg im1, im2, im3;
always @(posedge a or posedge b or posedge c) begin
    im1 = (a & b)[0];
    im2 = (b & c)[0];
    im3 = (c & a)[0];
