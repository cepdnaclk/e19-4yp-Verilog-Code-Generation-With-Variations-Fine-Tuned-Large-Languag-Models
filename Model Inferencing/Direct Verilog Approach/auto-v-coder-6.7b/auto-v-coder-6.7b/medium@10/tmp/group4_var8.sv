    case ({j,k})
      2'b00: q <= q;
      2'b01: q <= 0;

`default_nettype wire
```
In this modified code, a `case` statement is added inside the always block that checks the value of `{j, k}`. In the case when `{j, k}` equals 2'b00 (both are 0), `q` is not changed. In the case when `{j, k}` equals 2'b01 (first bit is 0, second bit is 1), `q` is set to 0. In the case when `{j, k}` equals 2'b10 (first bit is 1, second bit is 0), `q` is set to 1. In the case when `{j, k}` equals 2'b11 (both are 1), `q` is set to its complement. This modification is to demonstrate how to use a `case` statement inside a `always` block to change the output based on the input values.

Note: The `default_nettype wire` statement ensures that all the modules are using the default logic nettype (wire). This statement should be written at the top of the Verilog file, and it should be before any module declarations. It tells all module instantiations to use the default logic type (wire). 

This code uses a JK flip-flop as an example. J and K inputs are used to determine the next state of the flip-flop. The posedge of the clock is used to trigger the change of state. The state of the flip-flop is stored in the Q output. The case statement handles different combinations of J and K to determine the next state. 

The `reg` is used to declare a register which will hold the state of the flip-flop.
