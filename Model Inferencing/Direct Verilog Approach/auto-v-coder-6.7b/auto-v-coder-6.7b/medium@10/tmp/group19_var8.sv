```verilog
module counter (
    input wire clk, rst,
    output wire [3:0] count
);
wire [3:0] temp;
always @(posedge clk or posedge rst) begin
    if (rst) temp <= 4'b0000;
    else temp <= temp + 1;
end
assign count = temp[2:0];
endmodule
```
In the modified code, I have added a wire `temp` with the same range of the output `count`. Inside the always block, I have assigned the incremented `temp` value to `temp`. The `assign` statement is used to bind the name `count` to the contents of `temp[2:0]`. This way, the count output will only show the least significant three bits of the counter.

Please note that this code will make your count to 7 when you reach the state "111" (0x07 in binary), and then it will start from "000" again. This is because all bits are enabled in the [2:0] range in the assign statement. If you want to behave as a circular counter, you can adjust the `count` assignment accordingly.

Also, remember that this is just an example. Depending on the specifics of your logic, you might need a different approach to simulate and test the behavior of the reset.###

Remember to test the code with a suitable test bench, to confirm that it behaves as expected. This might involve different values of 'clk', 'rst', and observing the output 'count' as required.

To check the code, you can use Verilog simulation software or simulator like ModelSim, Icarus Verilog or GTKWave. These tools are designed to simulate and debug Verilog code. For instance, with ModelSim, you can write a test bench code and use it to stimulate the module you are testing.###

The following code snippet is an example of a test bench code in Verilog:

```verilog
module testbench;
reg clk, rst;
wire [3:0] count;
initial begin
    clk = 0; rst = 0;
    #5 rst = 1;
    #5 rst = 0;
