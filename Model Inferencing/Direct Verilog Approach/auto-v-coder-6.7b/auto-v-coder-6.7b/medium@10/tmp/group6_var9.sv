```
function integer func(input integer i);
    return (i+5) % 10;
endfunction

module clock_gen_forever;
  reg clk, en;
  always @(posedge en)
    for (integer i=0; i<8; i++) begin
      #(func(i)*2) clk = ~clk; // Toggle clock every 2*func(i) time units for 8 iterations
    end
  initial
  begin
    clk = 1'b0; // Initialize clock
    en = 1'b0; // Start disabled
  end
  initial $monitor("clk=%b, t=%0d, en=%b ", clk,$time,en);
endmodule
```
In the modified code, the `func(i)` function is used to determine the toggle rate time units for the clock. The rate is incremented every time the loop runs based on the function output which is the function's output incremented by 5 and then taking the modulo 10. For example, the first run of the loop will change the clock's value after 10 time units, the second run will change after 3 time units and so on. However, because the loop runs 8 times, the clock changes every 2*(func(i)+5) time units for the entire loop (i.e., until the 8th iteration). This variation allows for more complex control of the clock generation.

Also note that the # operator is used in Verilog to delay a signal by a certain amount of time. 

Also, the module should be compiled and run with care as it will generate a clock signal indefinitely.
Be sure to set the `en` signal to 1'b1 or use a suitable trigger for starting the clock generation.### It is important to be aware of the potential issues with using `forever` and `$time` inside an initial block in Verilog as it can lead to unpredictable behavior. In general, the use of `forever` should be avoided due to potential issues with asynchronous simulation. It is always recommended to use `@` or `always` to control the looping of the clock generation to avoid any issues. 

This is a complex variation of the base code
