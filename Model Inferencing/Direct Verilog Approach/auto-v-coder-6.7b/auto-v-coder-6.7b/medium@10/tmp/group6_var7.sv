```verilog
module clock_gen_forever;
  reg clk, en;
  // Generate clock using forever loop, controlled by 'en'
  always @(posedge en)
    forever #2 clk = ~clk;
  initial
  begin
    clk = 1'b0; // Initialize clock
    en = 1'b0; // Start disabled
  end
  
  initial
  begin
    #500ns; // Delay for 500ns before enabling
    en = 1'b1; // Enable clock generation
  end
  
  initial $monitor("clk=%b, t=%0d, en=%b ", clk,$time,en);
endmodule
```

In this variation, the clock generation is delayed for 500ns before it is enabled, which makes it easier to see when the clock toggles. 

Additionally, the clock generation is now enabled via the `en` signal, rather than being enabled at the same time as the module is instantiated. This makes it easier to control when the clock generation is started and stopped.
