```verilog
module mux24b(
input wire [3:0] a[2][3],
input wire [3:0] b[2][3],
input wire select[2],
output reg [3:0] y[2]
);
always @(*)
begin
if(select[1] == 0)
  y[1] = a[1][3];
else
  y[1] = b[1][3];

if(select[0] == 0)
  y[0] = a[0][3];
else
  y[0] = b[0][3];
end
endmodule
```

This code takes two 2D arrays of 4 bit wide vectors and a 2 bit wide selector. Based on the value of the selector, it selects the corresponding array element and assigns it to the 'y' output. The 2D array indexing is done using the XMR-style hierarchy for index expression. This means that select[1] will select the first 2D array and select[0] will select the second 2D array. Also, note that the element [1][3] is selected from both a and b arrays.

Remember, in Verilog, the indices of array starts from 0. The above code means a[1][3], which means a[0][3] and b[0][3] are selected based on the values of select[1] and select[0]. 

This means, if select[1] is 0, y[1] will get the value of a[1][3], and if select[1] is 1, y[1] will get the value of b[1][3]. This is done for the same condition applied to select[0] for y[0]. 

This variation will work with any kind of 2D array. However, it's important to consider the size of the array as it may lead to index out of bounds exceptions if the array size is not correctly defined. It's also important to consider that, for larger 2D arrays or dynamic data, you will need to iterate over the array elements and apply the conditions accordingly.
