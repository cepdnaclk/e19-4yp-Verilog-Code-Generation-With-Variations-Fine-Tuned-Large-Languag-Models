With this modified code, the monitor statement will print the value of 'a' at every positive edge of the clock for all scenarios. The always block inside the if-else statement is triggered on every change of the part-select of 'a'. The print statements are dependent on the value of the part-select of 'a'. The monitor statement is also dependent on the value of 'a' for all scenarios.

The initial block is triggered once at the beginning of the simulation, and the display statement is executed to print the initial value of 'a' at time 0.

The if-else statement is dependent on the value of the part-select of 'a'. If 'a[2:1]' is 2'b11, the first display statement is executed. If 'a[2:1]' is 2'b10, the second display statement is executed. Otherwise, the third display statement is executed.

The $monitor statement is triggered on every change of 'a'. The display statement is executed to print the current value of 'a' at the time of the change.

Please note that the '$monitor' statement is disabled in synthesis. It is used for debugging.

The value of 'a' is updated in the always block to trigger the if-else statement and monitor statement. Hence, the statements are executed with respect to the value of 'a'
