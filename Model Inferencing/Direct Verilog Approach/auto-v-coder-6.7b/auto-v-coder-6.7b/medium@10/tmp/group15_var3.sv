Just replace the output reg [7:0] ALUout; with output reg [7:0] [0:7] ALUout; and use array part-select ALUout[0:7] inside the always_comb block as shown above. This modification will allow you to use the ALUout as an array of 8 8-bit values. Note that the left and right operands still are arrays of 8 bits. If you want to use them as single 8-bit values, you must use ALUout[7:0] or ALUout[0]. No changes are necessary to the inputs. This is because the ALU operates on the least significant byte regardless of the size of the operands. The remaining bytes remain unmodified. If you want to use the entire array with a different size of operands, you could define an array of smaller size. Please adjust the index accordingly.

This solution is assuming the need for an ALU to output an array of 8 8-bit values instead of a single 8-bit value. If there was a single 8-bit value needed, you could use the same modified code but replace ALUout[0:7] with ALUout[7:0] or ALUout[0].

Remember to assign this to a block of D flip-flops (like in the case of a 8-bit D register) to store the output of your ALU. Be aware that the 1-bit output of a ALU is 8-bit wide. If you want to use the 1-bit output as a bit signal, your
