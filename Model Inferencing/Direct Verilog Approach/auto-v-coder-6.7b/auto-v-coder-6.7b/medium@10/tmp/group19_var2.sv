```verilog
module counter_array_slice (
    input wire clk, rst,
    output wire [3:0] count_array [0:7]
);
wire [3:0] count;
always @(posedge clk or posedge rst) begin
    if (rst) count <= 4'b0000;
    else count <= count + 1;
end
// Assigning a single bit of the array to output
assign count_array[0] = count;
endmodule
```

In this instance, the counter output is sliced and assigned to multiple elements of the array. The array element `count_array[0]` would have the exact same value as the counter output. This is a basic example of a design using array slicing within Verilog.
It is important to note that this example assumes that the counter increment is only significant in the least significant bit of the output, which would be the case in a binary counter. However, the same pattern can be extended to other cases depending on the operation to be performed. 

Also, this is a very basic example of using Verilog's array data type. To fully exploit its features, you should use Verilog arrays in a more advanced way. For example, to implement a multi-bit counter that increments across multiple bits at once, or to use multi-dimensional arrays for complex designs. 

For more advanced designs, consider using SystemVerilog's struct, union, or enum data types. These types are more flexible and powerful than Verilog's array data type. However, please note that SystemVerilog is not supported on all FPGA platforms. The above code should be understood as a demonstration of the concept at a basic level. 

SystemVerilog is typically used for complex designs where Verilog features can't be effectively used. For simpler designs, Verilog is often used as it is more readable and flexible. 

Finally, note that using Verilog array slices for such tasks is not recommended. It might cause unexpected results, as the array is a concatenation of slices, and changes to the slices will affect the array contents. Hence, it would be better to use separate wires for each bit of the counter output. 

If you want to keep using array slices, it is strongly recommended to
