```verilog
module Chap1Counter (Clk, Reset, Count);
input Clk, Reset;
output [3:0] Count;
reg [3:0] Count;
always @(posedge Clk or posedge Reset) begin
    if(Reset) Count = 0;
    else begin
        Count[0] = ~Count[0]; // Toggle the 0th bit of Count
    end
end
endmodule
```

In this code, a toggle operation is applied to the 0th bit of the Count register whenever a positive edge is detected on the Clk input (clock). This is because we are using a packed vector array slice in the procedural assignment, which is used to reference an individual bit or group of bits within the register. The other bits of the Count register will remain unchanged.

Please note that this code will toggle the 0th bit of the Count register on each clock cycle if a reset is not asserted. The counter will start at 0 and will cycle through all possible values in an infinite loop because the 0th bit toggles back and forth. This is a simple demonstration of how to use packed vector array slice to perform operation on a specific bit within a register.

You may also notice that, we have used `or posedge Reset` instead of `else` in the sensitivity list. This is because we want the reset to be able to reset the counter whenever a reset is asserted, otherwise the counter will keep toggling even if the reset signal is not asserted.

Remember that Verilog is sensitive to changes in all the signals in the sensitivity list and is triggered whenever the value of any one of these signals changes. Here, since the reset signal is also changing its state, we are including it in the sensitivity list as `posedge Reset`. 

This code might not be suitable for all practical use cases as it will be toggling and causing a high frequency of toggling in the counter. However, it is a good demonstration of a simple use case of packed vector array slice assignment.

For more complex use cases, you may want to use a different approach or a different approach with packed vector array slice assignment. This might include changing the state of the counter based on specific conditions or more complex logic operations. 

Also, Verilog uses blocking assignments (`=`) instead of non
