```verilog
module tst_dff_p_b();
  reg [1:0] di,clk; wire [1:0] do;
  dff_p d1(do,di,clk); // Instantiate the DFF
  initial begin clk=2'b0; di=2'b0; #35 $stop; end // Initialize & stop
  always #3 clk=~clk; // Generate clock
  always #5 di=~di; // Toggle data
  initial $display ("%m: Top-level testbench module"); // Display testbench name
  initial $monitor($time," clk=%b, di=%b, do=%b",clk,di,do);
endmodule
```
In this version of the code, the `di` and `clk` signals are arrays of 2 bits each, and the `do` signal is an array of 2 bits. The procedural assignment in the `initial` block is changed to index into the arrays by their respective indices. This modifies the assignment of the signals, so that we're testing an array of DFFs instead of a single DFF. It's also changing the delay of the signal toggling and so on to reflect the change in width of the signal. ### Note:
This kind of testbench for array of DFFs can't be tested by regular logic simulation tools, they only simulate single-bit FFs. It's intended to be used with simulator that can simulate array of flip-flops.

Also note that this code does not instantiate a single DFF module, rather it calls the `dff_p` module twice to instantiate two DFFs. This can be adjusted depending on how you want to test your logic.

Please note, the code provided does not contain a definition for the `dff_p` module as it is not provided in the question. It is assumed to be a flip-flop module which takes a Data In, Clock, and Data Out. If not, the code will not be synthesizeable.

Remember to replace `dff_p` with the actual module name for flip-flops in your design.### Alternative Code:
We can also modify the original code by using the `
