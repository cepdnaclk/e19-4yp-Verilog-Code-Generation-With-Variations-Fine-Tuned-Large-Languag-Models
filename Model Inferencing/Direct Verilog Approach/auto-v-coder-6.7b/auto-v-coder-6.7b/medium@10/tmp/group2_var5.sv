```
module example7_4(D, Clock, Q1, Q2);
input D, Clock;
output Q1, Q2;
reg Q1, Q2;

integer i;
reg [7:0] arr [0:1];

always @(posedge Clock)
begin
    Q1 <= D;
    Q2 <= Q1;
    i <= 0;
    while (i < 2) begin
        arr[i] = i;
        i = i + 1;
    end
end
endmodule
```

In this modified code, a while loop has been added where the index i iterates over the array from 0 to 1, and every time it increments, the array element is set to be the value of i. This loop is executed every time the clock edge is detected.

Remember to always consider edge conditions and potential race conditions when adding such logic to your design. These can lead to unpredictable behavior if not handled correctly. The above code should be thoroughly tested to ensure correct functionality. For example, if the condition for the while loop is i < 1, the assignment to arr[1] will lead to an out of bound error. Similarly, if the clock edge condition is not correctly formed, the always block can potentially lead to a latch inference or a combinational loop. (This code is for educational purposes only. The loop may cause the synthesis tool to infer a latch and a combinatorial loop, and the loop condition might lead to an out of bound error. These issues need to be considered and addressed.)

Also consider using an array of more than 2 elements and iterate over the array with a for loop. This adds more control and can help to avoid unintentional behavior. 

Here's a more robust version:

```
module example7_4(D, Clock, Q1, Q2);
input D, Clock;
output Q1, Q2;
reg [7:0] arr [0:3];

integer i;

always @(posedge Clock)
begin
    Q1 <= D;
    Q2 <= Q1;
    for(i=0; i<4; i=i+1) begin
        arr[i] = i;
    end
