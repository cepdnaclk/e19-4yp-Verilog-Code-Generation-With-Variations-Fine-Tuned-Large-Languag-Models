This code will compile without errors, but please note that it's not a typical use-case as the part-select on a vector in Verilog is usually done at the last signal of the vector so this might not fit into the context of the original problem statement. This is just to show how part-select expressions can be used. 

Also, you'd probably want to test the functionality of this part-select in a testbench module. In a real design, the assign statement might be inside a combinational always block.

For more detail and usage of part-select and vector indexing, refer to the IEEE 1800-2017 standard or any Verilog textbook or tutorial.### This is just an example and may not work with your exact circuit design. In most cases, you might need a part-of-whole signal assignment, or a parallel or serial assignment (like a shift register or mux), not a part-select. Use the code as a reference, adjust it to work with your specific project.### Remember to always verify your logic and simulation to ensure proper functionality and correctness.![\[FA2\]](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)
