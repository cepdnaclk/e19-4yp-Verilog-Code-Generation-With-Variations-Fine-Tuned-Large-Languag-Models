```verilog
module tst_CMOSsw1();
  reg in,con; wire [3:0] result;
  CMOSsw1 cmsw(result,in,con); // Instantiate CMOS switch

  initial begin 
    in=1'b0; 
    con=1'b1; 
  end // Start enabled

  always #5 in =~in; // Toggle data
  always #3 con=~con; // Toggle control

  initial $monitor($time, "in = %b, con = %b, output = %b ",in,con,result);

  initial begin
    #20 $stop; // Stop simulation
  end
endmodule
```
In this revision, instead of assigning a single wire to the output, the module is now designed to take an array. This allows for more general application where the output may be an array of signals. The slice range has been used to specify the output of the module, which must be an array.

Please update `initial $monitor($time, "in = %b, con = %b, output = %b ",in,con,out);` to `initial $monitor($time, "in = %b, con = %b, output = %b ",in,con,result);` in the modified code.

Also, the change here is to use `$stop` directly after the desired delay, as opposed to putting `$stop` inside an initial block. This is because `$stop` should be used for simulation control, not in an initial block or always block.

The result will be an array of signals, as the switch generates an array of signals. The slicing syntax `[3:0]` is used to specify a range of indices for the output array, which is used in the monitor statement. Please note that these are the start and end indices of the array, not the actual array elements themselves.

Remember to replace the names in the code and comment lines to match your actual setup.### Original and Modified Code Comparison:
The original code instantiates a CMOS switch to a single wire and checks the output with an initial block.

module tst_CMOSsw1();
