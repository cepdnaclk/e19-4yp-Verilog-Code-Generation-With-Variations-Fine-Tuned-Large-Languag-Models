```verilog
module contres(o,i1,i2);
input i1,i2;
output o;
reg [1:0] arr; // Add an array
initial begin
$display("%d", arr);
end
// Drive wire 'o' from two buffers with specified output strengths
buf(pull1, weak0) g1(o,i1); // Drives pull '1', weak '0'
buf(pull1, weak0) g2(o,i2); // Drives pull '1', weak '0'
// Resolution: 1,1->1; 1,0->1; 0,1->1; 0,0->0; 1,Z->1; 0,Z->X; Z,Z->Z
// Effective behavior is OR due to pull1 dominance over weak0
endmodule
```
The initial block in the modified code is inserted to check the array. This block should print the value of arr on the default stdout. Due to the nature of the "contres" module, the expected result is that the value of arr would not be displayed, as it is not assigned a value and has not been declared as an output. However, if you connect the "arr" array to an output pin, it would be possible to observe the changes over time.

In the final code, you can connect the "arr" wire to an output pin to observe the changes over time. Make sure to connect the "arr" wire to another module to be able to observe the changes. Alternatively, observe the changes in a simulation tool like VCS. Verilog doesn't provide a built-in way to output the array values over time as it's not an output of the module.

Please note: This change only works by modifying the initial block to observe the array. It will not change the expected behavior of the module, as the module's logic does not depend on this modification. The logic used in the module will be as it is. The array 'arr' would be assigned a value in a simulation but isn't an output of the module and won't be observed in synthesis.

Furthermore, the Verilog language allows only registers to be declared in an initial block, and they must be declared at the top level of
