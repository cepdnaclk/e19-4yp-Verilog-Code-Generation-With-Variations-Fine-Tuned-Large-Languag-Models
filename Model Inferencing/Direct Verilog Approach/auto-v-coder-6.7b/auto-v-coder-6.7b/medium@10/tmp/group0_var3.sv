```
In this modified code, we first assign array slice expressions to a_slice and b_slice. Then, we have two always_comb blocks to check if a_slice and b_slice are within the specified range. If any of them is out of the range, we set a_4d and b_4d to 0, otherwise, we set them to 1. Finally, we use the modified a and b inputs and s and ca outputs for the ha_4 module. It's important to note that this code assumes that a and b are 4-dimensionally packed logic variables with valid range list [0:15]. This would need to be adjusted based on the actual input and output signals.

Please replace `[0:15]` with `[low_range:high_range]` based on your specific requirements.

Make sure to also define `ha_4` module and its port naming. This should be
