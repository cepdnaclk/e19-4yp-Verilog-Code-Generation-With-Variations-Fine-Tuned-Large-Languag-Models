wire [2:0] part_select;
reg f;
assign part_select = x1[2:0];

always @(part_select or x2 or x3)
    if (x2 == 1)

In this code, a 3-bit part-select of the packed array x1 is made. Two comparisons are made: if `x2` is equal to 1, then f is set to 1 if and only if part-select is 001, and if `x2` is not equal to 1, then f is set to 1 if and only if part-select is 111. This modification demonstrates the use of part-select and checks if it is inside a fixed constant range.

This is a basic example of using part-select and condition checking in Verilog. However, the logic could be altered to suit different needs. Adjusting the condition and the constant range to suit the requirements would go beyond the scope of this example.

Moreover, this code assumes that `x1` is binary-coded as three-state values. If this is not the case, the part-select logic should be modified accordingly. For example, if `x1` is binary-coded tri-state, the part-select should be `x1[2:0]` instead of `x1[3:1]`.```verilog
