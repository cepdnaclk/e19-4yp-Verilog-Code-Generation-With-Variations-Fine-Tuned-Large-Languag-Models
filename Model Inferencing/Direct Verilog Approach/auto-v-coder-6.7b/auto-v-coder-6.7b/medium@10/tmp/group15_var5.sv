### Explanation:
In the original code, the always block was using blocking assignment (=) which was not allowed in the Verilog IEEE 1364-2001 standard. The always block should only be used with combinational logic and cannot include blocking assignments or procedural assignments that use non-blocking assignment (<=). 

The modified code is using the always_comb block to perform the same function. This is a combinational always block, which is equivalent to a procedural always block. Inside this block, the case statement is performing the same function of the original code, with the left and right inputs performing the specified operation based on their respective inputs from the mode array. The outputs of the operation are then assigned to the ALUout output.

Note: The 'default' case in case statements is optional. It will catch any values that don't match any of the case statements. The result is an X (unknown) output. In this case, we have chosen to make it an X for simplicity and for clarity. If you have control over the inputs that are going into the ALU8 module, you could add a specific default case to deal with unhandled modes.

The block of code is now synthesizable and does not use blocking assignments which are not allowed in Verilog. This code is also compatible with the IEEE 1364-2001 standard which has been widely adopted across the industry. It's often a good practice to ensure the code is clear, concise, and adheres to the language's rules.`
