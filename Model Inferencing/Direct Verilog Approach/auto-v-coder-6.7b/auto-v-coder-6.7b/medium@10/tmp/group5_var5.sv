```verilog

wire q, clock, j, k, preset, clear;
reg j, k;
jkEdgeFF jk(q, clock, j, k, preset, clear);

logic [3:0][3:0]  testArray = {4'b0000, 4'b0001, 4'b0010, 4'b0011};

end
endmodule
```

In the modified code, the procedural assignment `testArray[1][1] = q;` is added inside a block which monitors for any change in `q`. This assignment is designed to test the MDA behavior which is triggered by the change in `q`. If the MDA behaves accordingly, the `testArray[1][1]` should be updated with the value of `q`. 

Note: This is purely a simulation test and the actual implementation might need additional handling like in hardware design. Also, this code assumes the existence of `reset_ff`, `jkEdgeFF`, and `m555` modules and their respective interfaces. These modules are not present in the given scope. If they are part of your design, replace `reset_ff`, `jkEdgeFF`, and `m555` with your actual module names.

This code will not synthesize or compile, it's a way to stimulate the MDA to test its functionality. Please ensure the syntax and structure of your actual code matches this example as closely as possible so that your simulation is as accurate as possible.

Remember to test your code thoroughly before relying on it in a final product.```verilog
