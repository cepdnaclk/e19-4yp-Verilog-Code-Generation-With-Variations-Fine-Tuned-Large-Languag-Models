```verilog
module tst_dff_p_b();
  reg di,clk, [4:0] arr;
  wire do;
  dff_p d1(do,di,clk); // Instantiate the DFF

  initial begin 
    clk=0; di=1'b0; 
    for (integer i = 0; i < 5; i = i + 1) begin
      arr[i] = i;
      $display("arr[%d] is %d", i, arr[i]);
    end
    #35 $stop; 
  end // Initialize & stop

  always #3 clk=~clk; // Generate clock
  always #5 di=~di; // Toggle data

  initial $display ("%m: Top-level testbench module"); // Display testbench name
  
  initial $monitor($time," clk=%b, di=%b, do=%b",clk,di,do);
endmodule
```
In this code, a for-loop is used to initialize array `arr` with values from 0 to 4 and then display each element of the array in the initial block. The array index is used as an array index in the procedural assign in the initial block.

The behavior of the DFF and other hardware elements are unchanged. The main purpose of adding this code is to demonstrate how to work with array indices within procedural assignments in Verilog.

Please remember to replace "dff_p" with the actual module name of your DFF. The tst_dff_p_b module is a top-level testbench for the DFF. It instantiates the DFF and drives signals for it. The `#35 $stop;` line halts simulation after 35 time units, which is 35 ns in the default time precision of Verilog. The `always` block in the initial block generates the clock, and the `always` block in the initial block toggles the data input. The monitor is used to display the time, clk, di, and do signals at each time point. The display statement is used to print the name of the module. All these are common in Verilog testbench code.
