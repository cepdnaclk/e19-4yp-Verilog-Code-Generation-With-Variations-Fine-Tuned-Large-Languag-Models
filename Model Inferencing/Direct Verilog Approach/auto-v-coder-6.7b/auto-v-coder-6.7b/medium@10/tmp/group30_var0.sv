```
module dff_with_reset(clk, rst, data_in, state_out);
input clk, rst, data_in;
output reg state_out;
always @ (posedge clk) begin
if(rst) state_out = 0;
else state_out = data_in;
end
endmodule
```
This code creates a D-flip-flop (DFF) with asynchronous reset. When reset is asserted (rst equals to 1), the output state_out is set to 0, otherwise the value of data_in is stored in state_out. The always procedural block is used to capture the change on the clock edge. When a change happens on the clock, the if statement inside it checks if reset is active. If it is, the output state_out is set to 0, otherwise the input data_in is stored into the output state_out.

This design provides a basic flip-flop with synchronous reset that can be used in a variety of applications, such as storing a state of a system, or for sequential operation in a counter based system. It can be further customized for other application requirements.### Modified Code Comments:
The modified code includes a reset signal (rst) that is used to asynchronously set the flip-flop output to 0 when asserted (1). The flip-flop's behavior is such that the output will always be the input data (data_in) after a positive edge of the clock signal, which is captured by the always procedural block. When rst is asserted (rst=1), the flip-flop output will be set to 0. Otherwise, the flip-flop will store the input data. This design is useful not only for D-flip-flop applications but can be used for other synchronous flip-flop based applications too.### Conclusion:
The original base Verilog code provided does not need any change in function, but the comments and the description of the code was not provided, so I added a detailed explanation as well as comments and modified code for better readability and understanding. This modified code is a basic but important part of digital circuit design and can be further customized based on the requirements.```verilog
