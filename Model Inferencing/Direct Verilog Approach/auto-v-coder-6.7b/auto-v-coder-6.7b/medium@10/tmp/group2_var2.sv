```verilog
`define WIDTH 4

module example7_4(D, Clock, Q1, Q2);
input D, Clock;
output Q1, Q2;
reg [`WIDTH-1:0] Q1, Q2;

always @(posedge Clock)
begin
    integer i = 0;
    Q1 <= D;
    Q2 <= Q1;

    while (i < `WIDTH) begin
        Q2[i] <= Q1[i];
        i++;
    end
end
endmodule
```

In this code, we've updated the module to use packed array, `Q1` and `Q2`. The width of this array is defined by the `WIDTH` macro (`4` in this case). The while loop continuously updates each bit of `Q2` while increasing the index `i` to iterate through every bit of `Q1`. 

The loop will stop when all bits of `Q1` are transferred to `Q2`.

Remember to replace `4` with the actual width that you need. This code is written assuming that you're using a synthesizable tool like Xilinx ISE (Integrated Software Environment) or Vivado. The exact syntax and semantics may vary depending on other tools or languages.═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Note: In Verilog, all signals and variables must be declared. The updated code will set a default value for `Q1` and `Q2` upon initialization. The values are not preserved across clock cycles. If you do not want this default behavior you will need to declare the initial values in the module instantiation or set them in a specific block of code.══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

It's also worth noting that while this code will synthesize, it may not work as you expect. The `posedge Clock` event will cause the simulation to end if the clock does not change during the simulation. The code will then stop all other logic from being executed
