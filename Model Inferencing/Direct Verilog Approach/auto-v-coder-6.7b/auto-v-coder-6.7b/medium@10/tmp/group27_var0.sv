```verilog
module aoi_gate(o,a1,a2,b1,b2,sel);
input a1,a2,b1,b2,sel;// a1,a2,b1,b2 form the input
//ports of the module, sel is the additional port for selector
output o;//o is the single output port of the module
wire o1,o2, sel;//o1,o2,sel are intermediate signals
//within the module
and g1(o1,a1,a2); //The AND gate primitive has two
and g2(o2,b1,b2);// instantiations with assigned
//names g1 & g2.
xnor g3(o,o1,o2,sel);//The xnor gate has one instantiation
//with assigned name g3.
endmodule
```
In this example, we have added a selector (sel) as an additional input. This module now works differently based on the value of sel and the values of the inputs a1, a2, b1, b2. 

If sel is '0', the output (o) will be '1' if both o1 and o2 are '1'. 

If sel is '1', the output (o) will be '0' if both o1 and o2 are '1'. 

This is a simple example of how to use the XNOR gate (g3) in a Verilog module to create a logic gate with a selectable behavior. It demonstrates the use of Verilog's combinational logic design techniques.

Note: It's assumed that sel is a bi-state (0 or 1). If sel is unbi-state (like 0/1/X/Z) and we use it for condition branching, we need an additional level of logic to handle such scenarios. If sel is not used for condition branching, this approach is not needed as it can be easily handled by a normal XNOR gate.

Please, adjust the code according to your specific requirements.

The actual implementation of this code will depend on the specific FPGA architecture and the tools used for synthesis. I've assumed a simple implementation based on the provided code snippet. Be mindful of the exact requirements when using this
