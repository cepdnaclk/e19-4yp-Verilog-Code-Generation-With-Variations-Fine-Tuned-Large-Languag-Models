    // Unique case expression using inside with an array-slice range in a logic-vector array
    case ({I[8:1],I[0]}) inside
      [10:20] : a = 1; // Unique case statement

```
This code starts with initializing I to 0. Then, the while loop runs until I is less than 100, incrementing I in each iteration. The logic-vector array I is sliced into two parts to form a larger array. The unique case statement is used with a range of values, where the output of a is 1 if the value of I within the range, otherwise the output of a is 0. After 100 ns, the simulation is stopped by $stop. #100 is used to delay the $stop from being executed immediately. The $stop directive halts the simulation at the current time. In this case, the simulation will be stopped after 100 ns. #100 is the delay time specified in nanoseconds. This code first begins with initializing I to 0. Then, the while loop runs until I is less than 100, incrementing I in each iteration. The unique case statement is used with a range of values in the form of an array, where the output of a is 1 if the value of I falls within the specified range, otherwise the output of a is 0. At the end, simulation stops after 100 ns. #100 is the delay time in nanoseconds. This code is intended to illustrate the use of unique case statements and array-slice ranges in logic-vector arrays.
