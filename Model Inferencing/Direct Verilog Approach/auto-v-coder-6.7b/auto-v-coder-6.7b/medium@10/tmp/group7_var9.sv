The modified code will include a testbench that will verify the behavior of the circuit under specific conditions, including a series of tests over an array of inputs. 

```verilog
module contres(o,i1,i2);
input i1,i2;
output o;
wire pull1, weak0;

assign pull1 = 1'b1;
assign weak0 = 1'b0;

// Drive wire 'o' from two buffers with specified output strengths
buf(pull1, weak0) g1(o,i1); // Drives pull '1', weak '0'
buf(pull1, weak0) g2(o,i2); // Drives pull '1', weak '0'

initial begin
    integer i;
    reg [1:0] inputs;
    // Test array
    for (i = 0; i < 4; i++) begin
        inputs = i;
        #10; // Wait for 10ns
        // Check the output for each input combination
        $display("Output for (%b, %b) = %b", inputs[1], inputs[0], o);
    end
end

// Resolution: 1,1->1; 1,0->1; 0,1->1; 0,0->0; 1,Z->1; 0,Z->X; Z,Z->Z
// Effective behavior is OR due to pull1 dominance over weak0
endmodule
```

This code creates a variable `inputs` of size 1 bit wide, which is to be tested over a range of inputs from 0 to 3. Each step of the loop sets different values for i1 and i2, and the output for the current combination is evaluated. The output is then displayed on the console. This testbench will check all combinations of i1 and i2 as each line will represent one of the 4 possible input combinations.

**Note:** The initial block will need to be adjusted depending on the exact functionality you're aiming for, but the general idea is to fill a range of inputs and monitor the output. As the initial block is a continuous process (in continuous time), it will continuously monitor the outputs of the circuit under different test conditions
