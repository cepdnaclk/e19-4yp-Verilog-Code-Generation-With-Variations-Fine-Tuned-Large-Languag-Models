```verilog
module muxdff(D0, D1, Sel, Clock, Q);
input [3:0] D0, D1;
input [1:0] Sel;
input Clock;
output [3:0] Q;
reg [3:0] Q;

always @(posedge Clock)
    if (!Sel[1]) begin
        if (!Sel[0])
            Q <= D0;
        else
            Q <= D1;
    end else begin
        // do something else
    end
endmodule
```
In this code, `D0` and `D1` are arrays of 4-bits each and `Sel` is an array of 2-bits. The `muxdff` module takes `D0`, `D1`, `Sel`, `Clock` and outputs `Q`.

As `Sel` is an array of 2-bits, the `muxdff` module selects to either take the first 4-bit element of `D0` or the second 4-bit element of `D1` depending on whether the first bit of `Sel` is 0 or 1, respectively. The second bit of `Sel` is not used in this module. 

If you want to use a while loop with array elements, this code should be modified accordingly. For instance, you may want to do a loop for each element of `Q`. 

It is crucial to note that the bit fields of a packed array can be operated as a single 4-bit, 8-bit, 16-bit, etc. element, depending on the declaration in the module. Thus, using a while loop with packed array elements may require careful consideration.

Keep in mind that Verilog syntax and semantics are quite different to Python and may require a good understanding of the language to write and understand these kinds of constructs.###

This modified code may not be entirely correct if the context is not fully known or if the goal is completely different, but it should give you a general idea of how to handle this kind of task with packed arrays. 

The syntax and semantics of Verilog are quite different from high level languages, and this code merely attempts to show how you might construct a
