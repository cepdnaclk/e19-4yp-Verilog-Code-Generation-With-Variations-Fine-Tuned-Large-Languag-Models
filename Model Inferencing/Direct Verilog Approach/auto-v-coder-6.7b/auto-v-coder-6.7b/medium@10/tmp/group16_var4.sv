always @(*)
begin
  if(s[1]) //s[1] will be the upper bit of s
  begin
    if(s[0]) //s[0] will be the lower bit of s
      y = a;
    else
      y = b;

```
This code uses two bits (s[1] and s[0]) to select either of the inputs (a and b) based on the value of the bits. The behavior is similar to a 2-to-1 multiplexer, with the `s[0]` bit selecting between ‘a’ and ‘b’, and the `s[1]` bit controlling which set of bits to output. If `s[1]` is 0, the output will be `a` and if `s[1]` is 1, the output will be `b`. This variation is beneficial when one needs to handle more than two inputs or when there is a need for different kinds of mux control signals.###

Remember to verify the logic in your simulation environment to make sure it behaves as intended.

Also note that the verilog code always @(*) is used to respond to all changes in the design, as specified in any input, but this might not be necessary if you are only changing the output based on changes in the inputs. I have included it here for the sake of completeness.###

This code is meant to be synthesizable for any standard Verilog-A compliant tool. If you are using an ASIC-synthesis tool like Design Compiler, you might need to adjust the code slightly for its syntax. The code is also valid for simulation purposes.```
