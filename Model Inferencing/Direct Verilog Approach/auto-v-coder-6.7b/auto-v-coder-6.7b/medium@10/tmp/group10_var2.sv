In this modified version, a procedural continuous assignment is added inside the always block which allows to read/write values from/to a dynamic array selected via variable index. Note that the index is used as an offset from the base address (4'b0000), and the offset is updated using a MUX.

```verilog
module reg4(D, Clock, Resetn, Q, Index, ReadData);
input [3:0] D;
input [1:0] Index; // Added Index as an input
input Clock, Resetn;
output [3:0] Q;
output [3:0] ReadData; // Added ReadData as an output
reg [3:0] Q;
wire [1:0] Offset = Index; // Offset is a wire variable derived from Index
reg [3:0] DynArray [3:0]; // Modified into a dynamic array

always @(posedge Clock or negedge Resetn)
    if (Resetn == 0)
        Q <= 4'b0000;
    else
        Q <= D;

always @(posedge Clock)
    DynArray[Offset] <= D; // Write data to dynamic array
  
assign ReadData = DynArray[Offset]; // Read from dynamic array

endmodule
```

This modified code allows for a dynamic selection of the output when read from the dynamic array. If the Index is 0, ReadData will correspond to the 0th index of dynamic array. If the Index is 1, ReadData will correspond to the 1st index of dynamic array, and so on.### 

Please ensure that the values of Index can only be 0, 1, or 2, as the dynamic array only has 4 elements. Any values outside this range will result in undefined behavior. 

Note: This example demonstrates the use of Verilog's procedural continuous assignment and dynamic arrays. It should be noted that using this approach for a large-scale system is not recommended due to potential performance issues. 

In real-life application, you should always use registers (`reg`) for combinatorial logic and flip-flops (`wire`/`reg`) for sequential logic. Verilog's procedural continuous assignment
