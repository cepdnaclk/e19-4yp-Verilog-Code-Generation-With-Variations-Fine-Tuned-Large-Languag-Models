In the above code, a `reg [3:0]` dynamic_m variable is introduced to serve as a dynamic range list. The inside operator is used for the case statement to handle the dynamic range. Note that in an uninitialized case, the `default` block is still executed.
The `if-else` structure here is not strictly necessary, but it is used for clarity and simplicity in this example. The inside operator does not need to explicitly cover all the binary numbers from 0 to 3 to define the dynamic range, the range is determined by the values of the expression. In this case, the `default` block handles the `X` case.

Also note that the logic used in the `if-else` statement should be changed according to the specific requirements of the design.

This code will select the correct logic depending on the input vector `m`. If `m` is 0, the output is the same as the input; if `m` is 1, the output is the input shifted left by one; if `m` is 2, the output is the input shifted right by one
