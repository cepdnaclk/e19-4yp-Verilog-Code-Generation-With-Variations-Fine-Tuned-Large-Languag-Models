```verilog
module FA;
  input wire [3:0] A, B, Cin;
  output reg [3:0] Sum, Cout;
  assign {Cout,Sum} = A + B + Cin;
endmodule

module Ripple_Add;
  wire [3:0] A, B, Cin;
  wire [3:0] Sum, Cout;
  FA fa0(A[0], B[0], Cin, Sum[0], Cout[0]);
  FA fa1(A[1], B[1], Cout[0], Sum[1], Cout[1]);
  FA fa2(A[2], B[2], Cout[1], Sum[2], Cout[2]);
  FA fa3(A[3], B[3], Cout[2], Sum[3], Cout[3]);
endmodule
```
In the ripple adder, every FA instance is instantiated with an input carry and carries out the sum and carry for that instance. The result from the current instance is connected to the carry of the next instance. The sum and carry from the last instance (fa3) are connected to the outputs of the ripple adder. 

This Verilog code uses a part-select to specify the bit ranges in the part-select expression. Each instance of the FA module is created with a bit range of A[i], B[i], Cin, Sum[i], Cout[i] where i ranges from 0 to 3. The ripple add module instantiates these FA modules in a specific configuration to form a 4 bit ripple adder. 

The always block in the FA module is no longer required because the inputs are wires and outputs are regs. The outputs are always assigned in an always block, and the carry-out from one full adder is connected to the carry-in of the next full adder. The sum is calculated using the built-in addition operator. This code ensures that the ripple adder is implemented in a clean, concise and well-structured manner.

Note: This is a simple example for understanding. In real-world applications, the ripple adder is optimized for speed and area by using the full-adder logic with carry propagation. In such a case, the ripple ad
