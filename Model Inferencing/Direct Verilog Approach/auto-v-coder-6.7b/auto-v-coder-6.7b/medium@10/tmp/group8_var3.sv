```verilog
module dec2_4beh(o,i);
wire [3:0]o;
input [1:0] i;
//reg en; // Enable not used in dec2_4beh
always @(i) begin
  if(i[0] == 1'b1) begin
    o = i[1]? 4'b1000 : 4'b0001;
  end
  else begin
    o = i[1]? 4'b0100 : 4'b0010;
  end
end
endmodule
```
The added if statement will select a specific output depending on the value of the two inputs. If the first input is 1, it selects the corresponding output based on the second input. The two outputs are 4-bit vectors that correspond to binary numbers 8, 1 and 4, and 2. If the first input is 0, it selects the corresponding output based on the second input. The two outputs are 4-bit vectors that correspond to binary numbers 16, 4 and 1 respectively.

The if statement can also be replaced with a case statement, which might make the code clearer. The case statement would make the code more readable and would also give a more detailed error message when something goes wrong:

```verilog
module dec2_4beh(o,i);
reg [3:0]o;
input [1:0] i;
always @(i) begin
  case (i)
    2'b00: o = 4'b0001;
    2'b01: o = 4'b0010;
    2'b10: o = 4'b0100;
    2'b11: o = 4'b1000;
  endcase
end
endmodule
```
The above code is almost identical to the first variation. The only difference is the way of selecting the output. Both versions have equivalent functionality. The added if statement or case statement just improves the way the output is selected, but the functionality is the same. The output o corresponds to the binary value provided by the bitwise operation i[1]? 4'b10
