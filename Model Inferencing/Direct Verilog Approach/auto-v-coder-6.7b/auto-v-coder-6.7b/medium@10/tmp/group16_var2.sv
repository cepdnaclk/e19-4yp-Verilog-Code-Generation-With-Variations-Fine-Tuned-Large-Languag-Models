### Explanation:
The original code simply selected one of two inputs `a` and `b` based on value of `s`. We can modify the code to include more conditions by adding additional `else if` statements. For example, if both bits in `s` are 1, the output becomes `b`, if both bits in `s` are 0, the output becomes `a`. This gives us a 4-input mux.

The else statement is added to set 'y' to all zeroes if none of the above conditions are met. This might be useful in a design with multiple conditions for the `s` input.

This code will select `a` when `s[1:0]` equals `2'b00` or `2'b10` and select `b` when `s[1:0]` equals `2'b01` or `2'b11`.
The 4'b0000 is just a placeholder for the 'else' part, if we want to replace it with some other value we would modify these to suit our needs. 

This code can easily be modified to include additional conditions for the other inputs in the mux. This is an example of a 2-to-1 mux, but the same principles apply to a 4-input mux.

Note: The conditions inside the if-else statement are evaluated in order, so the conditions should be listed in the order from most to least specific so that the appropriate action is taken if the condition is met. This is known as the "if-priority" concept.
