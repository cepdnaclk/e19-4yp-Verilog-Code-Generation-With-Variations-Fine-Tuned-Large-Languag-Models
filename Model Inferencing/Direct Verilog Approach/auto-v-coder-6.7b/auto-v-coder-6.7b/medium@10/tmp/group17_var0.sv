```verilog
module mux41b (
input wire [3:0] c,
input wire [1:0] s,
output reg z
);
always @(s or c) begin
	casex ({s[1], s[0]})
		2'b0: z=c[0];
		2'b1: z=c[1];
		2'b10: z=c[2];
		2'b11: z=c[3];
		default: z=1'bz;  //default state, no path taken
	endcase
end
endmodule
```
This code will select the corresponding element from the input array `c` according to the input `s`, similar to the original example. 

Note: Output `z` is registered for synchronous use. You must register the output if this module will be used within a sequential process. 

In the case of casex, `2'b11` matches both `s[1] = 1` and `s[0] = 1`. Hence, it is useful for any 2-bit binary number. It can be adapted to match any number of inputs in the case statement.

This code is more flexible and can be used with any amount of binary inputs `s` and their corresponding array elements `c`. The case statement ensures that the output `z` selects the correct element from the array according to the input binary number `s`. 

Keep in mind that the size of the array input `c` and the number of input bits per element must match with the number of cases in the case statement. 

Also, the case statement is sensitive to 'x' (unknown) states, making it more robust and efficient than the original example. This is achieved by using the full casex notation to cover all combinations, including those leading to 'x' state.

In the 'default' case, 'z' is left in a 'z' (unknown) state if no valid condition is met, indicating an error. This is also more robust than the original code. 

This code can be easily adapted to handle more complex combinational logic, depending on the specific use case. It works by creating a case statement with different cases based on the value of `s`, and for each case
