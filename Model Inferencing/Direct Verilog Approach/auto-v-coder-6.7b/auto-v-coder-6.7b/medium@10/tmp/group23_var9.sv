```verilog
module RAM (output[7:0] Obus, input[7:0] Ibus, input[3:0] Adr, input Clk, Read);
reg[7:0] Storage[15:0];
reg[7:0] ObusReg;
assign #1 Obus = ObusReg;
always @(posedge Clk)
if (Read==1'b0)
    Storage[Adr] <= Ibus;
else
    ObusReg <= Storage[Adr];

// New Variation
integer j;
initial begin
    j = 0;
    while (j < 16) begin
        Storage[j] = 10 + j; // Using constant range inside a while loop
        j = j + 1;
    end
end
endmodule
```
In this modified code, a while loop is added using the array-slice operator, 'Storage'. The while loop runs until 'j' becomes 16, which is the total number of elements in 'Storage'. In the loop, each element of 'Storage' is assigned a value, which is a constant 10 plus the loop counter 'j'. This results in a RAM array filled with values 10 to 15. These values can be used to test the RAM module in simulation or synthesis.### Note:
The Verilog code here is illustrative and not synthesizable in hardware. The use of non-standard features such as a loop inside an always block or array assignment outside of an initial begin block, along with the `#1 Obus = ObusReg;` assignment line, would be removed in a synthesizable Verilog design. The purpose of this variation is to illustrate how one might introduce a while loop condition inside a Verilog codebase.```verilog
