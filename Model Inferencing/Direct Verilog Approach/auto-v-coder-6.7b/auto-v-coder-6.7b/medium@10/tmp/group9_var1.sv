```verilog
module pulses;
  reg [8:0] I;
  reg a,b;
  initial
    while (!b) begin
      a = I[0];
      b = I[1:2][0];
      I = I + 1;
    end
  initial I=0;
  initial #100 $stop;
endmodule
```
The unique case expression used in the code above is `I[1:2][0]`. This expression takes the bit value from position 1 (second bit) to position 2 (third bit) of the logic-vector array `I`. Please note that Verilog array indexing starts from 0, so `I[1:2][0]` is equivalent to `I[1]`.

In this code, we are continuously checking for the bit value of position 1 (second bit) in the logic-vector `I`. If it exceeds its value, the simulation ends. If not, it increments the `I` value, and again continues the checking of bit value in the logic-vector `I`. This continues till the value of `I` exceeds its maximum value.

To test this, run the simulation for 100 time units and check the value of `a` and `b` after the simulation stops to see that `b` and `a` are equal and `b` is `1`.

Please note that in Verilog simulation, the simulation time units are defined by `timescale` directive. For this example, we use `1ns` (nano-second) as a time unit. In other words, 100 time units corresponds to 100 nano-seconds.

This code is a basic example of how you can use a specific bit from an array-range in Verilog. This technique is useful in verifying specific bits of a signal. For example, if you want to verify only a specific bit of a digital signal, this technique can be very helpful.###
In the provided code, the module name is `pulses` and there are two reg type signals `a` and `b`. The value of `a` is assigned to bit 0 of `I` and the value of `b` is assigned to bit 1 of `I`. In this
