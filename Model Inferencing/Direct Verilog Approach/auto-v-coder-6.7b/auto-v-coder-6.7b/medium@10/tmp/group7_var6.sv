```verilog
module contres(o,i1,i2);
input i1,i2;
output o;
wire [1:0] wire_i = {i1, i2};

// Drive wire 'o' from two buffers with specified output strengths
buf(pull1, weak0) g1(o,wire_i[0]); // Drives pull '1', weak '0'
buf(pull1, weak0) g2(o,wire_i[1]); // Drives pull '1', weak '0'

// Resolution: 1,1->1; 1,0->1; 0,1->1; 0,0->0; 1,Z->1; 0,Z->X; Z,Z->Z
// Effective behavior is OR due to pull1 dominance over weak0
endmodule
```
The initial block is not included here as the initial block is typically used for resetting variables or for any other initial assignment. It wasn't required for this specific function. However, you can use it for your testing purpose.

The `wire_i` is the variable created to hold the values of `i1` and `i2` at once, making the task easier to handle than individually. This code will effectively act as the OR gate as the input values will be treated as {1,0} to get output as true/active pulling for 1, and {0,1} to get output as true/active pulling for 1. Any change in either {0,0},{0,1},{1,0} or {1,1} will result in output as false/inactive pulling for 0. Changes in Z state will be treated as don't care condition.

Please note that the modified code is just a suggestion. This kind of solution will work only if the input values of i1 and i2 are guaranteed to be either 1 or 0, otherwise it will not work. Additionally, this code should be used in simulations or verification to understand the behavior of the OR gate based on input strengths. In a real-world scenario, it might be better to handle the conditions in a case statement or using proper logic gates.
In short, the provided code does not solve the problem as asked but its
