```verilog
module dff(do,di,clk); // Behavioral D Flip-Flop
output reg [3:0] do;
input [3:0] di;
input clk;
initial
do = 4'b0; // Initialize output
// Assign input 'di' to output 'do' on negative clock edge
always @(negedge clk) begin
    for(int i=0; i<4; i=i+1) begin
        do[i] = di[i];
    end
end
endmodule
```
In the above code, we add a for loop inside a begin... end block with the intention of assigning all the bits of 'di' to 'do' one by one. The for loop cycles through each bit of the 'di' array. 

Please note that the input and output port width should match, otherwise you would need to add more or less bits to the arrays and adjust the assignments accordingly. Also, be careful with the assignment direction. The assignment is done with `do[i] = di[i]`, so all bits of 'di' would be assigned to 'do'.

Here, we are using the 4-bit wide array for the input and output. You can use the array index to the do or di to access each bit of the array. Also, replace the `4'b0` with the appropriate initial state for your case if needed.

Also, verify that you have properly connected and tested the Verilog code before use. The code provided is just for illustration and may not work as expected with your particular hardware or software configurations.###

Remember to compile and check the model simulations to verify the code is functioning as intended.

It is always a good idea to use a powerful simulator tool to verify the code. This provided example can be validated using simulators like Modelsim, Icarus Verilog, or Synopsys NCSIM. 

The simulation results will confirm the code's correctness and provide insights into any issues or discrepancies. 

This is just a demonstration and may not be suitable for production-level code.###

If you encounter any issues, you should work with the designer or development team to determine the appropriate solution. It's important to work with someone who is experienced with Veril
