   if(i[0]==1'b1 || i[1]==1'b1) // Add an if statement using the input to test if any bit is high

In this code, we add an enable signal to the dec2_4beh module and use it to control the decoder's operation based on the input. The enable signal is asserted when either bit of the input has a high value. It is deasserted otherwise. The if statement within the always block is used to update the enable signal based on the input. The enable signal is passed along with the other inputs to the dec2_4beh module. In the $monitor statement, the enable is included in the output display. The enable is then used to control the decoder's operation within the dec2_4beh block. This variation is done to demonstrate the usage of enables in decoders. This code is a variation and not a best practice or recommended solution. It should be noted that the original design with the dec2_4beh module not using the enable should be kept as per the original design intent. In general, enable signals can be used for timing constraint to implement the behavior of the design in synthesis. In this example, the enable signal is used to demonstrate a feature of the design.

Note: This code assumes that dec2_4beh is a block that has an enable input. If your dec2_4beh module does not have an enable input, you should modify the code accordingly. This variation is for learning and experimentation purposes only. It may not
