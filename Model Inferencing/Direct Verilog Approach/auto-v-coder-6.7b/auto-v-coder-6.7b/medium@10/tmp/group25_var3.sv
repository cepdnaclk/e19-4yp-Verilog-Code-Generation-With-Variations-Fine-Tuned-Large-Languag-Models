In this variation, added inside `case` conditional statement a dynamic variable index. This index is selected using the concatenation of `x1, x2, x3` and then each unique case outcome is defined by setting the value of `f` and `g`. This allows creating arbitrary combinations of `x1`, `x2`, `x3`.
Note, it is assumed that the order of bits in a concatenated number is left to right for 3'b000 to 3'b111. This can be changed based on your specific Verilog software system.

The case statement will determine the value of `f` and `g` based on the current value of `x1, x2, x3`. Please adjust the case value and the conditions as per your requirements.

This code is not a completely equivalent of the previous code (example7_5), as the dynamic variable indexing was added to the case. However, it shows how to use Veril
