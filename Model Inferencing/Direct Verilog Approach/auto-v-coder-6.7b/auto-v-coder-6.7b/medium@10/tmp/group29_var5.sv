initial begin
    // Data input
    data_in = 8'b10110110;
    
    // Generate output data
    generateData(data_in, result);

In this modified code, `generateData` task is used to iterate through each element of `data_in` and calls `getData` function to get the corresponding bit from `data_in`. The result is stored in `result` array. The `getData` function is then used to get the bit from `data_in` based on its index. Finally, the results are printed. 

This code can be used to create combinatorial logic circuits.

Note: The `getData` function and `generateData` task are written in SystemVerilog. These are standard functionalities that are available in this language. `$display` function is used to print the data on console.

Please replace the `8'b10110110` with your actual data_in value and similarly replace `8'b00000000` with your expected output. If you need to use different values, just modify those in-line in the code. This sample code provides an example of how you can use functions and tasks in combination with bit manipulation and array manipulation in Verilog/SystemVerilog. Adjust according to your needs. Also, it is important to note that the code assumes that the index is within the array's range, which is typically the case in simple designs. In a
