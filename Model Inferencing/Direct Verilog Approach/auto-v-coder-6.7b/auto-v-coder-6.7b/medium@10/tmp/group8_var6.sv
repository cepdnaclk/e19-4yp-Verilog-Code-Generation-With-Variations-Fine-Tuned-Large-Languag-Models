```verilog
if(i[1:0] == 2'b00) begin
    o <= 4'b0001;
end else if (i[1:0] == 2'b01) begin
    o <= 4'b0010;
end else if (i[1:0] == 2'b10) begin
    o <= 4'b0100;
end else if (i[1:0] == 2'b11) begin
    o <= 4'b1000;
end else begin
    o <= 4'bxxxx; // Default case
end
```
This code uses an indexed part select of the input signal i to select the correct case of the if statement. The output o is assigned a value depending on which case of the if statement is true. If no case is true, the output is defaulted to a value of 'x', which means the output is undefined or doesn't exist.

Note: This code makes use of the fact that the values of the output o are dependent only on the input i, not the enable signal. If the enable signal was used, the if-else structure would be different.

Also, the input could be modified based on your actual requirements. This code uses the same input i for all outputs, which may not be necessary. You may need to adjust it accordingly.

Finally, this code provides a basic understanding of the concept and should be adapted according to the specific requirements of your application.

Note: This code assumes that you have a decoder module dec2_4beh. If you don't have a decoder module, you may need to design one. This code also assumes that you are using a simulator that supports Verilog's system tasks like $monitor and $stop. These tasks are not necessary in hardware description languages like VHDL, but they can be useful for debugging and simulation.

The code doesn't include any hardware description because it would make the code very verbose. A hardware description using a decoder module would be more compact. However, the above code should be used as a starting point to understand how a decoder works.

In Verilog, the 'else' keyword is used to denote what happens if all the previous conditions have been false. This is sometimes called a default case.
