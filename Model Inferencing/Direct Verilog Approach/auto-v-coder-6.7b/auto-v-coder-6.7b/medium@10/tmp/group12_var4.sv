```verilog
module maj3 (a, b, c, y);
input a, b, c;
output y;
wire im1, im2, im3;
assign im1 = a & b;
assign im2 = b & c;
assign im3 = c & a;
assign y = im1 | im2 | im3;
endmodule
```
In the testbench, use random values for inputs a, b, and c.
### Testbench Code:
```verilog
module testbench;

reg a, b, c;
wire y;

maj3 M1(a, b, c, y);

initial begin
    a = 1'b0; b = 1'b0; c = 1'b0;
    #10;
    a = 1'b0; b = 1'b0; c = 1'b1;
    #10;
    a = 1'b0; b = 1'b1; c = 1'b0;
    #10;
    a = 1'b0; b = 1'b1; c = 1'b1;
    #10;
    a = 1'b1; b = 1'b0; c = 1'b0;
    #10;
    a = 1'b1; b = 1'b0; c = 1'b1;
    #10;
    a = 1'b1; b = 1'b1; c = 1'b0;
    #10;
    a = 1'b1; b = 1'b1; c = 1'b1;
    #10;
    $finish;
end
endmodule
```
This code is the base Verilog code for a 3-input majority gate. When the module is instantiated and connected to the appropriate inputs, the output of the module will be the majority of the input values.

We have provided testbench code to check the output of the module against different sets of inputs. In this testbench, we provide different combinations of values for the inputs a, b, and c, and print the outputs based on the current state of the inputs. This is a simple testbench that demonstrates the basic functionality of the majority gate
