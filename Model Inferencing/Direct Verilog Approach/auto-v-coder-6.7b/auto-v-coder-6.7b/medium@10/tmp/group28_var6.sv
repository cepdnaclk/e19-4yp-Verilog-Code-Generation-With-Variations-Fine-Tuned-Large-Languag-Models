```verilog
module aoibeh2(o,a,b); // Mixed structural/behavioral AOI
output reg o;
input [1:0] a,b;
wire a1,b1; // Outputs of AND gates
// Structural AND gates using primitives
and g1(a1,a[1],a[0]), g2(b1,b[1],b[0]);
// Behavioral NOR logic sensitive to AND outputs
always@(a1 or b1)
o = ~(a1 || b1);

// Add an initial block
initial begin
  o <= 1'b0;
  #1 o = a&b;
end
endmodule
```
This code snippet will always result in the output `o` being equal to the behavioral and operation between `a` and `b`. The initial block is used to initialize the signal `o` to the value of the unpacked vector slice `a&b`.

Note: This modified code assumes that the inputs `a` and `b` will always be a 2-bit vector. If this is not the case, you will need to modify the code to correctly handle the inputs and the behavior of the logic.joy@@@@
