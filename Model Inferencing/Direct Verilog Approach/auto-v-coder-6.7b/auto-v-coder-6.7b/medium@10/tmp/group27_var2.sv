```verilog
module aoi_gate(o,a1,a2,b1,b2);
input a1,a2,b1,b2;// a1,a2,b1,b2 form the input
//ports of the module
output o;//o is the single output port of the module
wire o1,o2;//o1 and o2 are intermediate signals
//within the module
and g1(o1,a1,a2); //The AND gate primitive has two
and g2(o2,b1,b2);// instantiations with assigned
//names g1 & g2.
nor g3(o,o1,o2);//The nor gate has one instantiation
//with assigned name g3.
endmodule
```
### Additional Instructions for Execution:
1. You need to instantiate the top module into your testbench.
2. Connect any input signals to the module and observe the output.
3. The output will depend on the actual input values.
4. If you want to see the output waveform, set the simulation time to a few clock cycles to see the waveform of each stage of your design.
5. Run the simulation in your preferred simulator and observe the waveform for the signals `o`, `o1`, `o2`.
6. You will see the waveform representing the output of your design as per the input for `o`.
7. If you are using a text-based simulator, you can also display the waveform in the console.
Additionally, if you have access to a graphical waveform viewer, you can create a waveform diagram to view the simulation.

Note: The case with inside expression feature is not directly supported in the base verilog code. However, you can use any Verilog compiler to translate the program into a specific target language using the -caseinside switch, and you can then run the translated program. This feature is typically used in synthesis tools for hardware description languages (VHDL, Verilog), and not in the standard Verilog language. The translation needs to be done manually.

In short, the actual implementation of the case with inside expression feature will depend on the tool being used for synthesizing the Verilog code into the gate level netlist. Please
