```verilog
module dff(do,di,clk); // Behavioral D Flip-Flop
output [7:0] do;
input [7:0] di;
reg [7:0] do; // Output for 8-bit should be reg.
initial
do=8'b0; // Initialize output
// Assign input 'di' to output 'do' on negative clock edge
always@(negedge clk) do = di; // Use non-blocking <= for sequential logic
endmodule
```
In the above code, the `do` and `di` are 8-bit wide. It will take in 8-bit wide input and give a 8-bit wide output, simulating an array with 8-bit wide elements. Please adjust `7:0` to match the actual width of your data.

The `clk` input is the clock. The `do` will change state based on `di` on the falling edge of the clock. Please adjust `negedge clk` to `posedge clk` or `edge clk` if you need a different clock edge configuration.

The Verilog code is a basic flip-flop. It can be modified according to your requirements. It keeps on checking for the change in `clk` on the falling edge. If `clk` changes, `do` gets the value of `di`. The use of `initial` and `always` statements in Verilog is to initialize the value of `do` and to keep on monitoring the values of `di` and `clk`.

You may need to modify this code to fit your needs. Keep in mind that this code is a basic design and can be customized to suit your project needs and constraints.

Lastly, the `always` statement in Verilog is a procedural block that is executed whenever the sensitivity list (the list of signals on which the block is sensitive) changes. In this case, the block is always executed whenever the `clk` changes on the negative edge. 

The `<=` operator is used to perform a non-blocking assignment, which means the right hand side of the operation is evaluated first and then the value is assigned to the left hand side. This is used for sequential logic.
