Add a function that provides a modulo 10 for the index, which will change the clock signal at 50%, 50%, 25%, 25%, 12.5%, 12.5%, 6.25%, 6.25%, 3.125%, and 3.125% of the time.

```verilog
module clock_gen_forever;
  reg clk, en;
  // Generate clock using forever loop, controlled by 'en'
  always @(posedge en)
    forever begin
      #10 clk = 1'b1;
      #10 clk = 1'b0;
      #(5 + ($random % 5)) wait (en == 1'b0);
    end
  initial
  begin
    clk = 1'b0;
    en = 1'b0;
  end
  initial $monitor("clk=%b, t=%0d, en=%b ", clk,$time,en);
endmodule
```
In this code, the clock signal is toggled every 10 time units. The wait statement is to introduce a delay before the next toggle based on a random number modulo 5, which makes the clock signal toggle at varying intervals. The wait statement is controlled by the enable signal, with the clock signal not being controlled until enable signal transitions to 0 (disabled). The wait statement also ensures that if the enable signal changes while the wait statement is executing, the wait does not interrupt the clock signal. However, the wait statement does not allow the clock signal to continue after the wait statement.

This code will generate a clock signal that alternates between high and low at random intervals between 5 and 9 time units, which corresponds to 50%, 50%, 25%, 25%, 12.5%, 12.5%, 6.25%, 6.25%, 3.125%, and 3.125% of the time, based on the random number within a specified range. The time intervals are calculated by the modulo function.
