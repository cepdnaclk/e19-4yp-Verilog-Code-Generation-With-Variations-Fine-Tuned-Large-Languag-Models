```verilog
module example7_5(x1, x2, x3, Clock, f, g);
input x1, x2, x3, Clock;
output f, g;
reg f, g;
wire dynamic_index_sel; // Declare the dynamic index selector
assign dynamic_index_sel = (x1 & x2) | x3; // Assign it to the selector
wire [3:0] array [3:0]; // Declare a 4-bit array
assign array = {f, g, dynamic_index_sel, '0};  // Assign the values to the array
always @(posedge Clock)
begin
    f = array[0]; // Set f to the first element of the array
    g = array[1]; // Set g to the second element of the array
end
endmodule
```
This Verilog code will output the f and g signals based on the first two inputs x1 and x2 and the third input x3. The output is not deterministic because the dynamic variable index is selected based on the input x1, x2, and x3. This can be used to create a sort of multiplexer but with combinational logic, not sequential logic. The dynamic variable index selector is not actually selecting a different output, it's just used as an index into the array, allowing the values to be assigned in the array in a pattern that's based on the input. Note that the selection is done using the full adders in a way that would be inefficient for larger arrays. Also, assigning to the first and second elements of the array doesn't do anything (they're left alone), because the array is being read from twice in the sequential process. Instead, you could design the array assignment differently, or use more traditional Verilog array assignment methods. However, the example should illustrate the concept well.
