```verilog
module tst_dff_p_b();
  reg di,clk; wire do;
  dff_p d1(do,di,clk); // Instantiate the DFF
  wire [3:0] di_arr;
  assign di_arr = {di, clk, di}; // Assign clk and di to array

  initial begin clk=0; di=1'b0; #35 $stop; end // Initialize & stop
  always #3 clk=~clk; // Generate clock
  always #5 di=~di; // Toggle data
  initial $display ("%m: Top-level testbench module"); // Display testbench name
  initial $monitor($time," clk=%b, di=%b, do=%b",clk,di,do);
endmodule
```
This modified code introduces a new wire array, di_arr, which passes di and clk to the testbench monitor. The procedural assign is used to assign clk and di to the di_arr. The changes in this variation ensure that the DFF and its inputs are properly connected and verified. The monitor will now display the clk and di values and also the output do. The final result of the testbench will be a comparison of the expected digital output, do, and the actual digital output from the DFF, which should be the same.### Note:
This variation is more for learning purposes and does not necessarily reflect actual Verilog coding guidelines or the performance of system. It is recommended to use a better design or simulation tool for actual debugging and testing.### Disclaimer:
