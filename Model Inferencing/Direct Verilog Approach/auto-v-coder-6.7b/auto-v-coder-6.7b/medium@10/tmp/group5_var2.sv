```
In the modified code, there's a procedural assignment block inside the module, which changes the flip-flop inputs based on the content of the 2D logic array mda. This can be used to test the behavior of the MDA (Multi-Dimensional Arrays) design elements in Verilog. The indexing should be adjusted according to your array structure and the number of clock cycles you'd like to test. In this specific case, the mda[1][0] and mda[2][1] indices are used to change the flip-flop inputs, but this could be adjusted to any valid 2D array index in your design.###

Please note that this code assumes an initial reset and a clock signal for operation, which is not included in the original code. Therefore, you have to connect this module to proper input connections for the test. 

Also, it's worth mentioning that the MDA in this case is just array-based simulation and it doesn't represent the actual behavior of a multi-dimensional array in hardware. Therefore, the modified code is purely illustrative and not intended for synthesis or any hardware design.```
