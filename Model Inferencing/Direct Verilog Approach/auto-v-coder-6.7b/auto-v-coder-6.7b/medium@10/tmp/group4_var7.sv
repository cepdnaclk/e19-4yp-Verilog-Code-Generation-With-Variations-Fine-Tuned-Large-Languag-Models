```verilog
module testbench;
  reg j, k;
  wire q;
  jk flipflop (.j(j),.k(k),.out(q));
  initial begin
    j = 1'b0;
    k = 1'b0;
    #10
    j = 1'b1;
    k = 1'b0;
    #10
    k = 1'b1;
    #10
    j = 1'b0;
    k = 1'b1;
    #10
    $finish;
  end
endmodule

module jk (j, k, out);
  input j;
  input k;
  output reg out;
  
  always @(j, k) begin
    // Function call:
    // If j is 1 and k is 0, set the index to 1.
    // If k is 1 and j is 0, set the index to 0.
    // If both j and k are 1, set the index to 0.
    // Otherwise, set the index to 1.
    case ({j, k})
      2'b00: out = ~out;
      2'b01: out = 1'b0;
      2'b10: out = 1'b1;
      default: out = ~out;
    endcase
  end
endmodule
```
In this variation, we've created a case statement within the jk module that uses a function call to determine the output based on the input bits j and k. This function call checks the values of the two inputs and returns 1 if both inputs are 0, 0 if k is 1 and j is 0, and ~out if both inputs are 1. The case statement then sets the output value based on the index returned by the function call.

To verify the code, we created a testbench to test the jk flip flop and ensure it behaves as expected. The flip flop is set to 00, then to 01, then to 11, then back to 00 to complete a cycle of a JK flip flop. The testbench is run to verify the flip flop functionality
