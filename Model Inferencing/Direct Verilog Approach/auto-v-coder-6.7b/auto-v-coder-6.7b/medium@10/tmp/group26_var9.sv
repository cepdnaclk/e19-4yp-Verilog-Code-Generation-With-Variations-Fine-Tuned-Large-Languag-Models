```verilog
module example5(x1, x2, x3, f);
input [15:0] x1, [31:0] x2, [47:0] x3;
output [15:0] f;
reg [15:0] f;
always @(x1 or x2 or x3)
    if (x2[20:16] == 5'b10000)
        f = x1;
    else
        f = x3;
endmodule
```
In this variation, we have modified the input and output signals to be of the type packed array of 16-bit width. The part-select in `x2[20:16] == 5'b10000` checks if the fifth bit from the 21st bit (21-bit index) to the 17th bit (17-bit index) in `x2` is 1. If it is, the output signal `f` is set equal to `x1`. Otherwise, `f` is set equal to `x3`.

Note: The example provided does not change the logic of the original code. It only modifies the input and output signals to packed arrays of width 16, and adds an if block in the sensitivity list of the always block. As the original code has only two input and output signals, it is not necessary to modifies the signal widths. It is just a demonstration of how one could change the code to fit a more complex situation. If you need to change the signal widths, you should be aware of the impact it would have on the data being processed. The Verilog syntax allows for variable bit-width signals, but it can make the code less clear and harder to understand. It is usually recommended to keep the bit widths as fixed as possible to improve readability and maintainability. It is always best to use a width that is a power of two when possible. In this case, the width of the signals was increased for more clarity and to follow best practices.joyce###```verilog
