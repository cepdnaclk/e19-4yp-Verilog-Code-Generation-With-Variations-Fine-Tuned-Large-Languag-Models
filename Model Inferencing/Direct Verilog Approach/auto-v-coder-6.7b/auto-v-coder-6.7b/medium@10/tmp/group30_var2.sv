```
module dff_with_reset(data, clock, r, out);
input [3:0] data;
input clock, r;
output reg [3:0] out;

always @(posedge clock or posedge r)
begin
if (r)
out <= 0;
else
out <= data;
end
endmodule
```
In the modified code, the input data and output out are now 4-bit wide. Also,'reg' keyword is used for the output out instead of 'output'. This is because 'output' is a keyword for declaring registers in Verilog, but'reg' is used for declaring wire and integer types. The assignment operation is changed from 'out = data' to 'out <= data', which represents an asynchronous reset.

This modified code will take 4 bits as input, and the output will also be 4 bits. When a reset signal 'r' is asserted, the output will be set to 0. This reset operation is synchronous. When the clock signal 'clock' goes high, then the input 'data' is assigned to the output 'out'. This operation is performed asynchronously when 'r' is high.

The `<=` operator is used for synchronous assignment, while `=` is used for asynchronous assignment. This is a difference between Verilog language. Procedural blocks like always, initial, etc. use these operators for synchronous and asynchronous assignments, respectively.

Please review the code again to ensure it fits your specific requirements. Also, ensure that your simulation environment is correctly set up to allow the simulation of these types of operations. The above code only handles synchronization and reset operations, which are most common in D flip-flops. You may need additional components for other types of operations. 

Remember to test your code thoroughly to ensure it behaves as expected. If you are dealing with very specific timing requirements or need to guarantee that clock transitions occur before and after specific operations, you may need to use a `posedge` or `negedge` clock edge in your procedural block.

If your simulation environment does not support 4-bit wide signals, you may need to adjust the code accordingly. The example provided is written assuming a simulation environment that supports 32-bit wide signals.```verilog
