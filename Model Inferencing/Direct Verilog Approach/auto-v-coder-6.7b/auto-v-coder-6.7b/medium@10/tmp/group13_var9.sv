```verilog
module test_wand1; //Testbench
reg [1:0] din;
wire [1:0] dout;

wand1 ww(.i1(din[0]),.i2(din[1]),.o(dout));

initial 
begin
  din = {0,0}; // Drv1=pull0, Drv2=pull0 -> o = pull0 (wand rule)
end

initial $monitor($time,"din=%b,dout=%b",din,dout);
initial #8 $stop; // Added stop

endmodule
```

In this modified code, we've made the changes to have the din to be a 2-bit input, `dout` to be the output from `wand1` (a 2-bit output), and the two inputs in `wand1` to be the MSB and LSB of `din` each. The `initial` block now sets the value of `din` as {0,0}, which will produce a pull-0 output for both `dout` MSB and LSB. The `$monitor` and `$stop` commands have also been added to monitor and stop the simulation at specified time.

The primary change is that we're using a `reg` for the input array `din`, and a `wire` for the output array `dout`. The input `din` is connected directly to the inputs `i1` and `i2` of the `wand1` module, and the output `dout` is connected to the output `o` of the `wand1` module. This way, the behavior of the `wand1` module can be verified in the testbench.!

Remember to replace `wand1` with your actual module name and its internal signals.

This is a basic testbench example. Depending on your actual design, you may want to modify or add more stimuli and assertions for the testbench.```verilog
module test_wand1; //Testbench
reg [1:0] din;
wire [1:0] dout;
