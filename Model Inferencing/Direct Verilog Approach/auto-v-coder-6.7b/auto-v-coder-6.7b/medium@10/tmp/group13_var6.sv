```verilog

wire o; // Added wire declaration
wand1 ww(i1,i2,o);
int i; // Declare the variable
initial
begin
i1=0; i2=0; // Initial state
for(i=0; i<8; i=i+1) begin // Loop from 0 to 7
  if( i[2:0] == 3'b001 | i[2:0] == 3'b010) begin // Test if the variable is 1, 2 or 3 in binary
  #2; // Wait for 2 time units
  i1 = ~i1; // Toggle i1
  i2 = ~i2; // Toggle i2
  end

```
In this code, a loop iterates through the numbers 0 through 7, and for each number, it checks if the binary representation of the number is 1, 2 or 3. If the condition is true, it toggles both inputs i1 and i2 every two time units.
Note: The Verilog `if` condition uses bitwise comparison and is equivalent to Python's `if (i & 7 == 3)` due to the way the bitwise and `&` operator interprets the binary values.

This code does not produce the correct behavior of the `wand1` module, because it is currently using both inputs simultaneously. However, as described, the code checks the condition for different numbers and toggles the inputs accordingly. 

It is important to note that `wand1` is a logic gate that is not built-in to Verilog. If it is included in the code, it needs to be defined elsewhere in the code or is not synthesizable.

If you want to use the `wand1` logic gate, you need to replace `i1 = ~i1;` and `i2 = ~i2;` with `o = ~o;`. This is because `
