```Verilog
//Function to get the binary index
function binary_index;
  input int index;
  begin
    binary_index = 32'b0;
    for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++) begin
      if(index[31:5] & 1 << i) begin
        binary_index[i] = 32'b1;
      end
    end
  end
endfunction

module aoi2(g,a,b,c,d,index);
output g;
input a,b,c,d;
input [31:0] index;
wire e,f,g1; // Intermediate signals
// Dataflow assignments for AND, OR, and NOT operations
assign e = a && b;
assign f = c && d;
assign g1 = e || f;
assign g = ~g1 && binary_index(index); // Final AOI output
endmodule
```
In the above code, a function called `binary_index` is defined. This function takes an input index as argument. It will give the binary representation of `index` inside the initial block. Then, the binary index is used as a condition in the `assign` statement to generate the output `g`. Please make sure to adjust the index range accordingly to cater to your module requirements.

In the example provided, the binary representation of `index` is 00011 if `index == 3`.

The `assign` statement for `g` is modified to use the binary index, as follows:
```Verilog
assign g = ~g1 && binary_index(index);
```
For an index input of 3, the `binary_index` function returns 00011, which when used as a bitwise AND operation with `~g1`, would essentially mean that `g` would only be a one (i.e., `g = 1`) if `g1` is a zero (i.e., `g1 = 0`).

Always note that the `index` used in `binary_index` function is only for the illustration purpose and you should replace it with the actual input index of your module. The provided code snippets should be modified and tailored according to your module needs.
