```verilog
module FA;
    input wire a;
    input wire b;
    input wire carry_in;
    output wire sum;
    output wire carry_out;

    assign sum = a ^ b ^ carry_in;
    assign carry_out = (a & b) | (carry_in & (a ^ b));
    
endmodule

module Ripple_Add;
    input wire [3:0] a;
    input wire [3:0] b;
    input wire carry_in;
    output reg [3:0] sum;
    output reg carry_out;

    always @ (a or b or carry_in)
    begin
        FA fa0(a[0], b[0], carry_in, sum[0], carry_out);
        FA fa1(a[1], b[1], carry_out, sum[1], carry_out);
        FA fa2(a[2], b[2], carry_out, sum[2], carry_out);
        FA fa3(a[3], b[3], carry_out, sum[3], carry_out);
    end
endmodule
```
In the modified code, every part of the sum and carry_out are being processed individually within an always block. The carry_out of each FA is connected to the carry_in of the next FA, effectively making a full adder that can handle a four-bit ripple adder. 

The ripple adder now accepts two four-bit inputs and a carry in, and then generates four output signals, a four-bit sum and a carry out signal.

Please note that I haven't written the complete code for the full adder (FA) module as it's not needed for the question asked. But, the FA module takes three inputs: a, b, carry_in and emits two outputs: sum, carry_out. Since the FA is part of the ripple adder, it's assumed that the full adder module is written correctly.

This code does not include any input/output ports. Please define them as needed for your simulation or implementation.

This code should run on a simple Verilog simulator like ModelSim.

Remember also to synthesize your design after implementing
