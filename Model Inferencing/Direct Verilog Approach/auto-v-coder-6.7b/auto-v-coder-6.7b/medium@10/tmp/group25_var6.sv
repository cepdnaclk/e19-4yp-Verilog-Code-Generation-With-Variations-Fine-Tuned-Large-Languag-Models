```verilog
module example7_5(x1, x2, x3, Clock, f, g);
input x1, x2, x3, Clock;
output f, g;
reg f, g;
always @(posedge Clock)
begin
    f = x1 & x2;
    g = f | x3;
end
endmodule
```
### Explanation:
This code is a simple clocked combinational logic circuit. The inputs `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` are ANDed together and the result (`f`) is ORed with `x3` to produce the output `g`. The `always` block ensures that the logic is performed on each clock edge.

The case statement allows you to select an array element dynamically based on a dynamic variable, which here is a constant value. This means you can use the same logic, but it allows more flexibility in the way you conditionally assign values.

This code is functionally equivalent to the original code but can be modified slightly for a specific use case. If you want to adjust the logic to fit a specific requirement, you can adjust the behavior inside the `always` block.

If your goal is to adapt the code for a specific use case where the logic cannot be simply modified, or where you want to use the case statement to conditionally assign values, then you could use a case statement in the same way as demonstrated below:

```verilog
module example7_5_mod(x1, x2, x3, Clock, f, g);
input x1, x2, x3, Clock;
output f, g;
reg f, g;
always @(posedge Clock)
begin
    case ({x1, x2, x3})
      3'b001: begin f = 0; g = 0; end 
      3'b010: begin f = 0; g = 1; end
      3'b011: begin f = 1; g = 0; end
      3'b100: begin f = 0; g = 0; end
      default: begin f = 0; g = 0; end
    endcase
end
endmodule
```
