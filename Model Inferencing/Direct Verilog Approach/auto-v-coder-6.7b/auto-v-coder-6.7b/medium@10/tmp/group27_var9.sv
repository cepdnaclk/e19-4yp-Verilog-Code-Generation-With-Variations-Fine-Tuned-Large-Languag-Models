wire o1,o2;//o1 and o2 are intermediate signals
and g1(o1,a1,a2); //The AND gate primitive has two
and g2(o2,b1,b2);// instantiations with assigned
//names g1 & g2.
nor g3(o,o1,o2);//The nor gate has one instantiation
//with assigned name g3.

end

```
In the modified code, a packed array `arr` is defined and assigned values. Then, a case statement is added to assign `bit_out` with the expression inside the brackets. The expression includes a AND gate with two inputs: `(a1&&a2)` and `((b1&&b2)?(b1&&b2):(a1&&a2))`. The former part checks for both the inputs being 1, while the latter part returns 1 if both `b1` and `b2` are 1, and `(a1&&a2)` otherwise. The bit_out is assigned with the value of this expression.
This is a simple example of a case with multiple cases and one hierarchical index on the array accessed based on the boolean expression.
Note: This modification assumes that the output of the module `aoi_gate` should be driven by the `bit_out` wire instead of `o`. The original code may remain as it is if the output `o` is not to be changed.
Also, a warning that the modification makes sense only if the inputs `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `
