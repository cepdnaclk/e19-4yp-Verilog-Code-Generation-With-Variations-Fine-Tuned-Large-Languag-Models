```verilog
module mux24b(
input wire [3:0] a,
input wire [3:0] b,
input wire s,
output reg [3:0] y
);
reg [3:0] mux_array[2][4];
always @(*)
begin
mux_array[0] = a;
mux_array[1] = b;
y = mux_array[s][{s,s}]; // This is a 2D array where each 4-bit vector is connected to the 4-bit vector of the other.
end
endmodule
```

In this variation, we have defined a 2D array `mux_array` where the 4-bit vectors `a` and `b` are connected in a particular way that will always enable us to address the 4-bit vectors using a 2-bit selector. On each clock cycle, the 4-bit `y` output will therefore be the same as the 4-bit vector at the current `s` row in the 2D array. Note that we use `{s,s}` to use the same `s` value as the index for the 2D array. This means that `s=0` will map to the `a` vector and `s=1` will map to the `b` vector. This is a way to select between the two inputs based on a binary selector `s`.

This code will behave the same as the original, but it is structured slightly differently for clarity in 2D array indexing. Feel free to expand upon this if you want more depth in 2D Array indexing in Verilog.###

Remember, the 2D array approach is not always the most effective or efficient way to implement a multiplexer in hardware but can be used in certain scenarios. It's usually better to use a direct if-else or case statement to implement multiplexers in verilog. 

Also note that this code will work correctly only when the inputs `a` and `b` are always different. If they are identical, then the output `y` will always be the same as `a` or `b`. This is because the indexing of the 2D array works incorrectly when `s=0` and `
