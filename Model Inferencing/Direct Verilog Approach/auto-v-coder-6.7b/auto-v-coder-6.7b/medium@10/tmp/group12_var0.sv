### Here, we have used a for loop that iterates over every bit in the inputs. It checks if any of the three inputs are active (i.e., they are 1), and if yes, sets y to 1. If none of the three inputs are active, then sets y to 0. This is a simple majority logic function, which can be used to handle a variety of situations. The 'X' value is used to indicate an undefined state (e.g., when inputs have different values simultaneously) which is checked and managed within the for loop.
It's important to note that the code is designed to handle values of 'X' in the inputs, and it will not change the output 'y' if its current value ('X', 0 or 1) is already set. This ensures that 'X' values are propagated correctly throughout the design. ###

Also notice that this code does not use the old-style Verilog `and` and `or` operators, but instead uses the `&` and `|` operators for bitwise AND and OR operations, which are more commonly used in Verilog for dealing with packed arrays. This makes the code more efficient and readable.

Lastly, the SIZE parameter is used to make the size of the inputs and outputs adjustable, in case the design evolves to require different
