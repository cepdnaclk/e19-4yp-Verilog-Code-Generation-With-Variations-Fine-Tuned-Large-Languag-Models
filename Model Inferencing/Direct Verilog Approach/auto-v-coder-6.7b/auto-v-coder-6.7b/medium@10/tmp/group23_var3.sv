```verilog
module RAM (output[7:0] Obus, input[7:0] Ibus, input[3:0] Adr, input Clk, input Read);
reg[7:0] Storage[15:0];
reg[7:0] ObusReg;
wire[3:0] temp;
assign Obus = ObusReg;
always @(posedge Clk)
if (Read==1'b0)
    Storage[Adr] <= Ibus;
else
    ObusReg <= Storage[Adr];
endmodule
```

In Verilog, array-slice operand can be used to slice an array. For instance, `array[index]` is equivalent to `array[index:index]`, where the upper and lower bounds of the slice are both `index`. Thus, `array[15:10]` or `array[5:0]` will give the last 6 elements of the array array.

The `while` loop is a type of iteration control statement. Its syntax is:
```verilog
while (condition)
  statement;
end
```
If the `condition` is true, the `statement` will be executed, and the process will be repeated until the `condition` is false.

However, Verilog does not support `while` loop directly, as Verilog does not support a feature to execute a statement multiple times if a condition is satisfied, unlike higher-level languages such as Python. If you need to execute a statement multiple times, you should use a `for` loop or multiple `if` statements instead.

Here is a variation of the code that includes a while loop with iterator:

```verilog
module RAM (output[7:0] Obus, input[7:0] Ibus, input[3:0] Adr, input Clk, input Read);
reg[7:0] Storage[15:0];
reg[7:0] ObusReg;
reg [4:0] i = 0;
always @(*)
  begin
    while (i < 15)
      begin
        i = i+1;
        if (i == Adr)
          begin
            if (Read == 0)
              Storage[
