The above code introduces a switch between the outputs depending on the state of the inputs, simulating a multiplexer or combinatorial logic with a dynamic switch based on the input values. Note: The case statement here is exhaustive, and can be modified/reduced according to specific conditions. This example shows a more realistic use of the case statement, where each possible combination of inputs can be explicitly handled.
