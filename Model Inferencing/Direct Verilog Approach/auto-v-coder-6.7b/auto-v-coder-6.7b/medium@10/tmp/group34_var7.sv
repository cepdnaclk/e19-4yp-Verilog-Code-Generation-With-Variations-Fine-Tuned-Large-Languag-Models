```
module gates4_top (
input wire [3:0] sw,
output wire [2:0] ld
);

typedef enum {
OR = 3'b011,
AND = 3'b101,
XOR = 3'b110
} OpCode;

OpCode Sel;

always @* begin
    case (sw)
      4'h0 : Sel = OR;
      4'h1 : Sel = AND;
      4'h2 : Sel = XOR;
      default : Sel = OR;
    endcase
end

gates4 U1 // Assuming 'gates4' provides and4_, or4_, xor4_ outputs from input 'x'
(
.x(sw),
.and4_(ld[2]),
.or4_(ld[1]),
.xor4_(ld[0])
);
endmodule
```

In the above code, an enumerated type is defined that holds the three possible operation selectors. In the always block, a case statement is used to assign the Sel value based on the switch input. Then, the Sel variable is propagated to the gates4 module. Now, based on the Sel value, the gates4 module provides three separate outputs. 

Please remember to change the constants in the OR, AND, XOR statements based on the actual switch inputs.###

The above code assumes a gates4 module that takes a 4-bit input and provides three separate outputs for AND, OR, and XOR operations on the input. If this is not the case, the code needs to be adapted accordingly. The code snippet also assumes that 'gates4' provides the operations in the correct input and output port mapping, which needs to be updated based on the actual module's requirements.

Lastly, note that the selected operation is not performed in the modified design. Depending on the requirements, additional logic may be added to perform the selected operation on the input and store the result in the ld output signals. 

This is a simple example of how to use an enumerated type to select a different operation for each possible input state, and how to integrate the selected operation into the gates4 module. In a more complex design, this could be applied to multiple different operations or different inputs per operation.
