```verilog
`timescale 1ns / 1ps
module counter (
    input wire clk, rst,
    output wire [3:0] count
);
reg [3:0] count_reg;

always @(posedge clk or posedge rst) begin
    if (rst) count_reg <= 4'b0000;
    else count_reg <= count_reg + 1;
end

initial begin
    #1 count_reg <= 4'b1010;
    #1 count_reg <= 4'b0000;
end

assign count = count_reg;

endmodule
```
In this modified code, the counter logic is in the always block, and the initial block is used to add the functionality of simulating specific cases. Instead of using an output wire, the `assign` statement is used to tie the internal register to the output. This means that the output will be driven by the internal register throughout the simulation, not by some external logic. 

Also, the initial block in the Verilog design file is used to initialize the values of the signals in the design. In this case, the counter is initialized to "1010" and then to "0000" following two clock cycles. These are random values, and they could be anything else you want. The first line `#1 count_reg <= 4'b1010;` will wait for a delay of 1 nanosecond (1/1000 second) and then set the count_reg to "1010". The next line `#1 count_reg <= 4'b0000;` does the same for the next clock cycle.

The `assign` statement is used to define the counter's output which is connected to the count_reg. This means that the output counter will be driven by the internal register throughout the simulation, not by some external logic. 

Remember to change the initial values depending on the desired functionality of your test bench.

This is a basic example of Verilog programming. It is designed to be a simple counter with a test bench that initializes the counter's value and then verifies its operation.

You should consider using these signals as inputs/outputs to test your code, rather than just connecting
