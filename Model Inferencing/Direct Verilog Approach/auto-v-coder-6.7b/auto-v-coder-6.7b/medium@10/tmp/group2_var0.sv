```verilog
module example7_4(D, Clock, Q1, Q2);
input D, Clock;
output Q1, Q2;
reg Q1, Q2;
always @(posedge Clock)
begin
    Q1 <= D;
    Q2 <= Q1;
end

// Adding a new parameter to demonstrate the usage of packed arrays
parameter P_COUNT = 2;
reg [P_COUNT-1:0] packed_array;
integer i;

always @(posedge Clock) begin
    // Using while loop with indexing inside a packed array
    i = 0;
    while(i < P_COUNT) begin
        packed_array[i] <= D;
        i = i + 1;
    end
end

endmodule
```

This modified code extends the previous example by adding a parameter `P_COUNT` for defining the size of the packed array (in this case, 2 elements). It also demonstrates a while loop that uses a variable `i` to index inside the packed array. The loop continues until `i` reaches the defined `P_COUNT`, and at each iteration, `Q1` is assigned the current value of `D`.

Please note that Verilog does not support dynamic array sizes or resizing at runtime like some other languages like Python or Java. Thus, a constant size of packed array must be specified at design time.

Also, please be aware that this modified code is just an illustrative example and is not necessarily a good practice for Verilog coding. This example is illustrating the usage of packed arrays and loops but is not a good practice to use packed arrays in real-world applications as they can be difficult to synthesize and may not perform well with certain tools. In real-world applications, packed arrays should be used sparingly and with caution.
Lastly, make sure to always ensure the functionality of your code before applying it to a real-world environment. Testing the code is crucial to ensure it behaves as intended.
