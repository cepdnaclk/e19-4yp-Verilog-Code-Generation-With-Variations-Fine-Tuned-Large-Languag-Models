```verilog
module dec2_4beh(output [3:0] o, input [1:0] i);
always @(*)
begin
    o = 4'b0000;
    if (i == 2'b00)
        o[0] = 1'b1;
    else if (i == 2'b01)
        o[1] = 1'b1;
    else if (i == 2'b10)
        o[2] = 1'b1;
    else if (i == 2'b11)
        o[3] = 1'b1;
end
endmodule
```

This modified version creates a behavioral always block with a case statement. The case statement is no longer necessary for this task and it's replaced by an if statement. In this case, there are only 4 possible combinations (00, 01, 10, 11) so four if conditions are needed to handle these cases. The output vector is initialized to all zeros, and then only one of the four indices is updated to 1 based on the input i. The resulting behavior is that o is equal to 4'b0001 when i is 2'b00, 4'b0010 when i is 2'b01, 4'b0100 when i is 2'b10, and 4'b1000 when i is 2'b11. This behavior should be equivalent to the original case-based behavior.

Please note that this is a direct translation of the original code, and the original code and its behavior may have been modified in some way to fit into the provided context. Please review your code to ensure it meets your requirements.

Additionally, the if statement can be replaced with a case statement for more compact syntax, if the application allows:

```verilog
always @(*)
begin
    case (i)
        2'b00 : o = 4'b0001;
        2'b01 : o = 4'b0010;
        2'b10 : o = 4'b0100;
        2'b11 : o = 4'b1
