```verilog
module example7_5(x1, x2, x3, Clock, f, g);
input x1, x2, x3, Clock;
output f, g;
reg f, g;
always @(posedge Clock)
begin
    f = x1 & x2;
    g = f | x3;
    case(g)
        1: f = x1 | x2;
        0: f = ~x1;
        default: f = x1 ^ x2;
    endcase
end
endmodule
```
In this variation, based on the value of `g`, `f` can change its value. If `g`'s value is 1, `f` will be assigned the bitwise OR of `x1` and `x2`. If `g`'s value is 0, `f` will be the bitwise NOT of `x1`. If `g`'s value is neither 1 nor 0, `f` will be the bitwise XOR of `x1` and `x2`. Note that the default case is always executed when none of the above conditions are met.

The code will be compiled with gcc compiler with C++ wrapper. This code will simulate a module that performs the bitwise operations and checks the value of `g` in the case statement and assigns `f` based on the condition.### Run the Code:

```C++
#include <iostream>

#define ClockSignal 1
#define x1 1
#define x2 0
#define x3 0

int main() {
    int f, g;
    f = 0;
    g = 0;
    
    #define f (x1 & x2)
    #define g (f | x3)

    switch(g) {
        case 1:
            f = x1 | x2;
            break;
        case 0:
            f = ~x1;
            break;
        default:
            f = x1 ^ x2;
    }

    std::cout << "f: " << f << ", g: " << g << std::endl;

    return
