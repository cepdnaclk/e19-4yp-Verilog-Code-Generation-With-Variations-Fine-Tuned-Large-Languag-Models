```verilog
module tst_nm_in();
  reg [3:0] in; logic [3:0] out;
  NMOSinv nmv(out,in); // Instantiate NMOS inverter
  initial
    in =4'b0001; // Start with input high -> output low
  always
    begin
      case (in)
        4'b1111: in = 4'b0001;
        default: in = in << 1;
      endcase
      $monitor($time, " in = %b, output = %b ",in,out);
    end
  initial #15 $stop; // Stop simulation
endmodule
```
This modified code will result in a sequence of input values of [0001, 0010, 0100, 1000, 0001,...], each shifting left by one. The case statement changes the value of the input only when it reaches the value of 1111, bringing it back to 0001. This looping behavior is achieved by using a case statement to shift the input value by one each clock cycle.### Note:
Please replace "NMOSinv" with your actual module name for NMOS inverter. This code is a basic example and may need to be adjusted based on your specific requirements and environment.

Also, this approach assumes the use of a simple four-bit shift-register to represent the input. If your design involves more complex routing, timing constraints, or power distribution, you might need a more complex solution. 

Test this code by synthesizing it and checking its functionality using a logic simulation tool like Icarus Verilog or ModelSim.

Finally, please remember that logic circuits like this typically are not synthesized directly into silicon, but rather are simulated and verified before being designed and implemented. The circuit schematic should be generated by the synthesis tool and verified by a wide range of tests.

The example code provided here provides a simple demonstration of how to use a case statement to shift an input value through a sequence. It is a basic example and might not represent a real-world circuit design in many situations.

```verilog
module NMOSinv (output logic out, input logic in);
