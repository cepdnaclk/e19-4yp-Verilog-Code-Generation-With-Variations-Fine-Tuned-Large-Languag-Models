```verilog
module dec2_4beh(output [3:0]o,input [1:0]i);
reg [3:0]o;
always @(i) begin
if (i==2'b00) o = 4'b0001;
else if (i==2'b01) o = 4'b0010;
else if (i==2'b10) o = 4'b0100;
else if (i==2'b11) o = 4'b1000;
else o = 4'b0000; // Default output when i is not 0, 1, 2, 3
end
endmodule
```

In this new version, an else if statement is added to the original module.
The new if statement compares the value of 'i' to the value of 00,01,10,11, and assigns the corresponding output value.

If 'i' is not 0,1,2, or 3, the else statement will output 0000 as the default output. This allows the code to only assign one output value, but still allows the module to be initialized correctly based on the inputs.

This should allow the dec2_4beh module to properly decode the given inputs and outputs as intended.

Remember to change the code back to the original if you want the original behaviour.

Note: This is a very basic implementation of a decoder and may be not the best way to design it in a real-world scenario. For a more complex implementation, a case statement would be more appropriate. However, it's important to understand that any code is not necessarily the best or only the right way to design a circuit, it should be the right way in the context of the problem at hand. In some cases, the solution may involve using specific hardware constructs, like look-up tables, or more advanced constructs like FSMs, that may be overkill for a simple decoder.### Base Verilog Code:

```verilog
module tst_dec2_4beh();
wire [3:0]o;
reg[1:0] i;
//reg en; // Enable not used in dec2_4
