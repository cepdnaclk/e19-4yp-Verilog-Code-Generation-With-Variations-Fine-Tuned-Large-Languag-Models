```verilog
module test_k;
wire q, clock, j, k, preset, clear;
reg j, k;
localparam MOD = 2;
logic [0:MOD-1] jk_array [0:MOD-1];
jkEdgeFF jk(q, clock, j, k, preset, clear);
initial
begin
reset_ff;
j = 1;
k = 0;
jk_array[0][1] = 1'b1; // Setting a value to test 2D array usage
end
m555 timer(clock);
endmodule
``` 

In this variation, a 2D array `jk_array` is created with `MOD` as the size which means the array can hold `MOD*MOD` values. The index of the array is accessed within the `initial` block, a procedural assignment is made to populate the array with a constant value. 

Please note that the actual behavior of the modifiable `jk_array` is dependent on the specifics of the `jkEdgeFF` module, as well as any subsequent verification, not to mention the `reset` and `clear` signals. You should verify this with a design environment before using the MDA behavior in any way. This example is for educational purposes only. 

Remember to replace `jkEdgeFF` with your actual module name. It doesn't exist in this example.###
Also, please replace `m555` with your actual module name. It doesn't exist in this example.###
This will not synthesize and will throw errors without a real design environment, as it's only a test case.###
It's always recommended to use actual modules and simulate in a design environment when verifying MDA behavior. The above code is a suggestion.###
It may not fit your exact needs, but it should give you a good starting point for your verification. Good luck with your MDA work!---

P.S. Please note that using 2D array for this is purely for testing. Actual logic design might not need this. You might consider using the real design in a design environment (like ModelSim, Verilator, etc.) for actual verification. --->>>
