```verilog
module nil;
reg [1:0] a;
initial
begin
a = 2'b01;
$display ("t=%0t display: a = %b", $time, a);
end
always @* // Changed
begin
    a = {a[0], a[1]};
    $display ("t=%0t monitor: a = %b", $time, a);
end
endmodule
```
This Verilog code first initializes the `a` register to `01`. The `$display` statement prints the `a` value at the current time. Then the `always @*` block is triggered whenever any part of the array `a` changes. The value of `a` is reversed and then again printed.

With the above code, the simulation output would be:
```
t=0 display: a = 01
t=2 monitor: a = 10
t=5 monitor: a = 01
```
This is due to the fact that the always block is triggered when the value of `a` changes and the `a` value is reversed within the block. The `$monitor` statement is also triggered at these times.### Note:
The `always @*` statement is used for continuous assignment, which activates whenever any of the inputs to the block change, including an internal flip-flop in the hierarchy. This will cause the reversal of the least significant bit and the most significant bit of the `a` register. 

This also shows how a continuous assignment block (`always @* begin... end`) can be used in Verilog to detect changes in signals and take action. This is quite important for designing advanced digital circuits in Verilog.```verilog
module nil;
reg [1:0] a;
initial
begin
a = 2'b01;
$display ("t=%0t display: a = %b", $time, a);
end
always @ (a) // Changed
begin
    $display ("t=%0t monitor: a = %b", $time, a);
end
endmodule
```

In this version, the `always @ (a) begin... end` block is activated whenever the value of `a` changes. This
