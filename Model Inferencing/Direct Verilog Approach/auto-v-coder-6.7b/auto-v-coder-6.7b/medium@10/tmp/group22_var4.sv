```verilog
module tb;
reg [7:0] array [0:7];
initial begin
array[0] = 1'b0;
array[1] = 1'b0;
array[2] = 1'b0;
array[3] = 1'b0;
array[4] = 1'b0;
array[5] = 1'b0;
array[6] = 1'b0;
array[7] = 1'b0;
end

always begin
if (array[0:5] > 5) begin
array[6] = 1'b1;
end
else begin
array[7] = 1'b1;
end
$display ("t=%0t display: array[6] = %b, array[7] = %b, array[0:5] = %b", $time, array[6], array[7], array[0:5]);
$monitor("t=%0t monitor: array[6] = %b, array[7] = %b, array[0:5] = %b", $time, array[6], array[7], array[0:5]);
end
endmodule
```
In this modified code, part-select `array[0:5]` is used as a condition. If the sum of the part-select is more than 5 (which is not true for array[0:5] in this initial phase), array[6] is set to 1, otherwise array[7] is set to 1. The $display and $monitor statements are utilized for debugging and monitoring purposes. 

This code shows how a part-select on an array can be used in a conditional expression in a Verilog module.### Note:
Make sure you test the verilog code properly before implementation. The above example may not work as expected if the sum of array[0:5] is less than 5 at initial phase. The if-else statement condition needs to be modified for an actual scenario.

Also, always verify that your test bench reflects the proper condition to check part select on an array.### Remember, always use proper tool (ModelSim, Icarus Verilog etc.) for synthesis and simulation in Verilog.
