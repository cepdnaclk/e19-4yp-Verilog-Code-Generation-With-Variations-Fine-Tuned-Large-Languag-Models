In this modified code, we've added a procedural assignment inside the initial block. This assignment is made at the positive edge of the clock. The array `jk_array` is used to test MDA behavior. The procedural assignment will not change the behavior of the `jkEdgeFF` module, but it will help to observe its behavior when the procedural statement runs. Note that this is a simple example and not the intended use of procedural assignments in Verilog. It's merely a possible test you can do with your design.

Remember, procedural assignments are not recommended to use in modern designs and generally should be avoided. As an alternative, you can use continuous assignments to give an alternate behavior to the output `q`.

However, this modification is added for the sake of demonstration of procedural assignment and array use in Verilog.

Please note: This code needs to be run in a hardware simulation environment to see its effect. It does not provide a simulation for the `jkEdgeFF` module, which is assumed to exist in your design. The `m555` module is also assumed to exist.

This is quite an advanced example and not typically used in modern Verilog designs. It's recommended to use continuous assignments and combinational logic to verify your design with procedural assignments, and array usage for testing. In general, procedural statements should be avoided in modern Verilog designs for the same reasons that they are not recommended in the first place. It can also lead to a lot of confusion when debugging and understanding the behavior of your design.### The variation code is
