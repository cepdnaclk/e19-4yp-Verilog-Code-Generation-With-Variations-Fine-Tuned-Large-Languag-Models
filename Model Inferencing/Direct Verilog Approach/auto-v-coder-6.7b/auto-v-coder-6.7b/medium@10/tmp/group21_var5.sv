This modified code uses a case statement to select an index into a 4D output array, which is read from a file named "out4d.mem". This allows for more complex simulations.

This particular case statement and array setup would require some kind of testing tool or method to create or generate the "out4d.mem" file which contains the 4D array values. This setup would depend on the specific simulation setup and the logic used. 

Remember to replace "nm_inverter" with the name of your inverter module. This example assumes the nmv module is a 1-input 1-output module, and the output is high when the input is low. If that's not the case, the case statement and logic in the always @(*) block should be adapted accordingly.

This code should be run in a Verilog simulator. Note that it's not guaranteed that this code will work perfectly as-is, and you should adjust it according to your specific requirements and the hardware you're simulating.

Also, this code is
