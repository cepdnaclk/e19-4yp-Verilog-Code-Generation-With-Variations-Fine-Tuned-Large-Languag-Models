```verilog
module aoi_gate(o,a1,a2,b1,b2);
input a1,a2,b1,b2;
output o;
wire o1,o2;
wire [1:0] arr [2:0][2:0];

and g1(o1,a1,a2);
and g2(o2,b1,b2);
nor g3(o,o1,o2);

always @(*) begin
    arr[1][1] = 2'b10;
    arr[2][2] = 2'b01;
    case ({arr[1][1], arr[2][2]})
        2'b10: o = 1;
        2'b01: o = 0;
        default: o = 0;
    endcase
end

endmodule
```
In this variation, the case statement inside the always block is accessing a packed array with XMR-based hierarchical index. This is a simple way to simulate a case statement which does not directly support the hierarchical index access in Verilog. This example is not directly applicable to the AOI gate because the input-output mapping is different in the case statement, but it serves as an example of how the case statement can be used with the XMR-based hierarchical index access in Verilog. Please make sure to replace `arr[1][1]` and `arr[2][2]` with your actual input or output to modify the behavior of this modified code.

Note: The AOI gate logic you mentioned doesn't match the gate definitions in the provided code. I'm assuming you mean a 2-input NOR gate instead of a 2-input NOR gate. If it's the latter, the code should remain as it is, but the behavior of the AOI gate will need to be changed to match the logic you're trying to implement.
