        index1 = 1;
        index2 = 2;
        logic_array[index1][index2] = 1;
    end

### Testing MDA behavior:
This example will increment the 2D logic array with a constant index on every posedge of index1. The index1 is assigned on the initial block and then it waits for a posedge to change the value in the 2D logic array.

This example demonstrates that the MDA (Multi-dimensional array) works as expected. The 'logic_array' is an array of vector of bits, with indexed by N-1 and M-1. This behavior is valid in Verilog. The simulation waveform for this code will show the value in the array changing every time index1 changes and all other values remain same at all times, due to the posedge trigger.

Note: Please be aware that this code snippet does not synthesize to hardware. It is purely a simulation verification model written in the SystemVerilog language. Therefore, it is meant to serve as a learning resource by instructing the reader to understand how to manipulate multi-dimensional arrays in Verilog and understand the effects of different types of programming constructs. Notable modifications from the original base code snippet are minimal and focused on the point of testing the multi-dimensional array behavior.

This code is also a good example of how multi-dimensional arrays can be used in Verilog. They are a powerful tool for memory management and efficient data manipulation. However, the use of multi-dimensional arrays with procedural assignments may need to be viewed as a feature rather than a best practice or best use of the language. That being said, the point of the example is to show how they work and to illustrate the behavior of arrays
