```verilog
module contres(o,i1,i2,i3,i4);
input i1,i2,i3,i4;
output o;

buf(pull1, weak0) g1(o,i1);
buf(pull1, weak0) g2(o,i2);
buf(pull1, weak0) g3(o,i3);
buf(pull1, weak0) g4(o,i4);

endmodule
```

In the code above, we have extended the testbench to 4 inputs 'i1', 'i2', 'i3', 'i4'.
Please note that this does not alter the behavior of the module, as the "buf" primitive has a direct output strength property, not an effective input strength. In a real-world scenario, different input strengths might also be taken into account.

You may also want to add a delay to test the logic's propagation delay.

```verilog
module contres(o,i1,i2,i3,i4);
input i1,i2,i3,i4;
output o;

wire w1, w2, w3, w4;

buf(pull1, weak0) g1(w1,i1);
buf(pull1, weak0) g2(w2,i2);
buf(pull1, weak0) g3(w3,i3);
buf(pull1, weak0) g4(w4,i4);

buf(pull1, weak0) g5(o,w1);
buf(pull1, weak0) g6(o,w2);
buf(pull1, weak0) g7(o,w3);
buf(pull1, weak0) g8(o,w4);

endmodule
```

In the modified code above, a new module is introduced with 4 inputs and 4 outputs. Each wire 'w' is driven from a buffer with specified strength. Then the output 'o' is driven from the buffer with specified strength. This allows to control the inputs strengths and observe their interactions.

Remember to test with appropriate testbench to cover various scenarios as well.
