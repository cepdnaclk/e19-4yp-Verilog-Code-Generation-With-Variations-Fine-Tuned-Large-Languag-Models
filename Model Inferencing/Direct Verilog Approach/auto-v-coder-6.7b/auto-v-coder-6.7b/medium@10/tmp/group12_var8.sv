```
module maj3 (a, b, c, y);
input a, b, c;
output y;
wire [3:0] im;
assign im = {c, b, a};
assign y = |im[3:1];
endmodule
```
In this code, we replace the 3-stage logic with a single 4-bit XMR and use a binary slice to select the middle two inputs. This results in a single 4-input LUT, which is more efficient than the original 3-stage logic. 

In the `assign im = {c, b, a};` line, we're packing the inputs into a 4-bit vector. In the `assign y = |im[3:1];` line, we're using the binary slice to select the middle two bits. The `|` operator performs a reduction OR operation, returning 1 if any of the bits in `im[3:1]` are 1. 

This modification is more efficient because it reduces the number of logic elements required to implement the logic to a single LUT. This also makes the code simpler and easier to understand. The original code has three logic gates, whereas the modified code has only one. 

We should also note that the XMR-style input order in Verilog doesn’t affect the functionality, but it’s good practice to keep the input order consistent. In this case, `im` is intended to be used with a packed array, so it's a good idea to keep the inputs in order. This simplifies understanding the logic by making the logic easier to match to the input order.

Please update this code based on the specifics of your design or project. This is a basic example to illustrate the concept. The actual implementation might be more complex, depending on the specific design requirements.

This modified code does not handle XMR-style inputs, as they are unique to Verilog HDL and might require a different design approach. However, the main point of this modification is to replace a more complex logic with a simpler one. The simplicity allows for less error and easier verification, also making the code easier to read and write.

I hope this helps you to understand the concept and provide a solution to your problem.
