```verilog
module RAM (output[7:0] Obus, input[7:0] Ibus, input[3:0] Adr, input Clk, Read);
reg[7:0] Storage[15:0];
reg[7:0] ObusReg;
assign #1 Obus = ObusReg;
always @(posedge Clk)
if (Read==1'b0)
    for(integer i = 0; i < 16; i++) begin
        if (i == Adr) begin
            Storage[i] <= Ibus;
            break;
        end
    end
else
    ObusReg <= Storage[Adr];
endmodule
```
This code uses a while loop instead of the if statement to read data into the RAM. The while loop iterates over the `Storage` array until it finds the matching address. This code is similar to the original code, but it utilizes a while loop for read operation instead of an if statement. This variation is more similar to the way RAMs operate in hardware and can be useful for understanding the underlying operation. However, keep in mind that while loops are not recommended in Verilog for this specific task as they don't provide a clear or efficient way to handle the logic. The use of `for` loops would be more suitable in this case. 

This variation of the code is just for educational purpose, not recommended for real-world purposes. The original code is the more efficient and readable approach due to the use of if statement. It can also be optimized further by using Verilog's unique features like bitwise operations or shorthand assignments to minimize the code size. It's also worth noting that this code is written under the assumption that `Adr` is never greater than 15 (16-bit address space). If the address may exceed this range, more sophisticated addressing methods would be required.```verilog
