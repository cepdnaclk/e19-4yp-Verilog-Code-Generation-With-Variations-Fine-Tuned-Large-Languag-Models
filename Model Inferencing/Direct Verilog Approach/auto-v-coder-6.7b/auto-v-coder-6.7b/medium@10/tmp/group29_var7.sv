```
module muxdff(D0, D1, Sel, Clock, Q);
input D0, D1, Sel, Clock;
output Q;
reg Q;
always @(posedge Clock)
    if (!Sel)
        Q <= D0;
    else
        Q <= D1;
endmodule

module muxdff_tester(Clock, Sel, Q);
input D0, D1, Sel, Clock;
output Q;
wire [4:0] array;
reg [4:0] array_dff;
initial begin
   array = fn(array_dff);
   while (1) begin
      #10;
      Sel = 1'b0; // Select the first array element
      D0 = 1'b0; // Set the first array element to 0
      Sel = 1'b1; // Select the second array element
      D1 = 1'b1; // Set the second array element to 1
   end
end
muxdff mux(D0, D1, Sel, Clock, Q);
endmodule
```

In the above code we have introduced an operation which can be used to test the muxdff module. The function fn(array_dff) is used to perform some operations on the array_dff and return the result. The while loop in the initial block continuously changes the Sel and D0/D1 inputs for the muxdff module. The muxdff module is then instantiated in the muxdff_tester module.

Please note that the actual array operations might require an input and output port, as well as any other necessary components. In this case, we've used wire and reg for simplicity. 

Please replace `fn(array_dff)` with your own array operation function. Also, make sure that the Sel and D0/D1 inputs can be changed at every positive edge of the clock without any delay in between.

Please note that the above code can be an illustration of a way to use the muxdff module inside a while loop in test bench. It's not a typical usage of a muxDFF in a synthesisable RTL design and should be treated as a test code structure.
