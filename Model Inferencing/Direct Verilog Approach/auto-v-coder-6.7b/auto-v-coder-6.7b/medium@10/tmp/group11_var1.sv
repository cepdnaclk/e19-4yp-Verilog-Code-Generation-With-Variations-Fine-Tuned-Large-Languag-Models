```verilog
module aoi2(g,a,b,c,d);
output g;
input a,b,c,d;
wire e,f,g1; // Intermediate signals
// Dataflow assignments for AND, OR, and NOT operations
assign e = a && b;
assign f = c && d;
assign g1 = e || f;
assign g = ~g1; // Final AOI output
endmodule

// Simulation Environment
module aoi2_testbench;
reg a,b,c,d;
wire g;

aoi2 uut (g,a,b,c,d);

initial begin
// Initialize the array with random values
reg [1:0] indices[] = '{0,1,2,3};
initial begin
$dumpfile("dump.vcd");
$dumpvars(1);
// Cycle through the array indices and write values
for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) begin
    {a,b,c,d} = indices[i];
    #10;
end
$finish;
end
endmodule
```

This will write to the dump.vcd file with the waveform of the signals, which can be visualized with a waveform viewer (like GTKWave).

Please note that the index array for each element in the block is being initialized with the same value '0', '1', '2', '3'. This can be updated according to the test case requirements. Also, this code is written in Verilog. The final 'g' output will always be '1', as per the logic implemented. If you want to adjust the inputs and observe the output, you can modify 'indices' array values or the indices[i] inside loop. #10; is the timeunit for the simulation, which is 10ns in this case. The output can be verified at g.

Remember to add the necessary library files in the project if not using any built-in Verilog library functions. Also, verify that the simulation tool (like ModelSim, QuestaSim, etc.) is configured for the required library files and system verilog or verilog 2001 or 2005.
