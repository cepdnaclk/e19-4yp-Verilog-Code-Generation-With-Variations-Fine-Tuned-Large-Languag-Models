```verilog
module dec2_4beh(output reg[3:0]o, input reg[1:0] i);
always @(i)
begin
if(i == 0)
begin
o = 4'b0001;
end
else if(i == 1)
begin
o = 4'b0010;
end
else if(i == 2)
begin
o = 4'b0100;
end
else if(i == 3)
begin
o = 4'b1000;
end
else
begin
o = 4'bZ; 
// 5th bit is not possible as per DECIMAL to BINARY conversion but added for simplicity
end
end
endmodule
```
In this code, I added an if statement to the behavioral always block which checks the input values and assigns the output in binary.
The output is a 4-bit binary number. For decimal values 0-3, the output is given in binary. For all other values, the output is 'Z' (high-impedance state in the sense of Verilog). The number 5 is not included in decimal to binary conversion so 'Z' is added for the test.
### Testbench
```verilog
module tst_dec2_4beh();
wire [3:0]o;
reg[1:0] i;
dec2_4beh dec(o,i);
initial
begin
i =2'b00;
end
initial $monitor ($time, " output o = %b, input i = %b ", o,i);
initial #14 $stop; // Stop simulation
endmodule
```
The initial block in the testbench tests the input values starting from 00. The $monitor statement prints the output and the input values. The testbench stops after 14 time units.### Note:
This code only works with decimal values between 0 and 3. For decimal values 4 and above, the output will be 'Z'. This simulates a conversion from decimal to binary. You can replace the decimal number 5 with any decimal number you want to test for. Remember to update the if-else conditions accordingly. (12
