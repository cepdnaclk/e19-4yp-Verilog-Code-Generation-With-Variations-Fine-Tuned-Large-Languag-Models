```verilog
`timescale 1ns/100ps
module maj3_p (input a, b, c, output y);
wire im1, im2, im3;
parameter
    tplh1=2, tphl1=4,
    tplh2=3, tphl2=5;
always @(*)
begin
    /* Original and statement block */
    and #(tplh1, tphl1) (im1, a, b);
    and #(tplh1, tphl1) (im2, b, c);
    and #(tplh1, tphl1) (im3, c, a);

    /* Modified or statement block */
    or #(tplh2, tphl2) (y, im1, im2, im3);
end
endmodule
```
This modified code will allow a function call inside the always block. It should also be noted that, when using always @(*), the code can be rewritten as a function call returning array and used inside the always block. 

For instance:
```verilog
`timescale 1ns/100ps
module maj3_p (input a, b, c, output y);
wire [2:0] im;
parameter
    tplh1=2, tphl1=4,
    tplh2=3, tphl2=5;

always @(*)
begin
    /* Original and statement block */
    im[0] = a && b;
    im[1] = b && c;
    im[2] = c && a;

    /* Modified or statement block */
    y = im[0] || im[1] || im[2];
end
endmodule
```
This code will correctly calculate the output `y`. #() is assumed to be the delay in ns. The parameter `tplh1=2, tphl1=4, tplh2=3, tphl2=5` are delays in ns.

The difference is that the code using always @(*) is cleaner and is more readable. It also removes some unnecessary signals that might have been created by
