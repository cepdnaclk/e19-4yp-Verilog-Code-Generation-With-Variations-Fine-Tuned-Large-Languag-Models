```verilog
module RAM (output[7:0] Obus, input[7:0] Ibus, input[3:0] Adr, input Clk, Read);
reg[7:0] Storage[15:0];
reg[7:0] ObusReg;
assign #1 Obus = ObusReg;
always @(posedge Clk)
if (Read==1'b0)
    Storage[Adr] <= Ibus;
else begin
    integer i = 0;
    while (i < 8) begin
        ObusReg[i] <= Storage[Adr][i];
        i = i + 1;
    end
end
endmodule
```
In this variation, the while loop condition is used to iterate through the bits of Storage[Adr] in a certain way. It is not necessary to use a while loop in this instance as only 8 bits are selected for ObusReg, but it provides an example of how you might want to select a certain number of bits. In this case, the loop is there to demonstrate that you can use the Verilog language features and it is not necessary for the specific operation of the code.
It is also worth noting that this code assumes that the address space is of 16 elements. If your address has any more bits, you might need to adjust the address range.joy_###joy

Also, please make sure to have a deep understanding of how the Verilog programming model works. The while loop in this code is just for demonstration purposes. If you think it may not be necessary or if you have a better way to perform the operation you are looking to achieve, you may want to consider alternatives.joy_###joy```verilog
