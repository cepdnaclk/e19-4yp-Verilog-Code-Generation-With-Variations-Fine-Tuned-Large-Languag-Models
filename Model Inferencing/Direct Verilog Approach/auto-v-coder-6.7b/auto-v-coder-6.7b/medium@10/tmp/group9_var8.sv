```verilog
module pulses; // Corrected pulse generation attempt
  reg [8:0] I;
  reg a,b;
  always @(*) begin
    case (I)
      1: b = I[0]; // Assign bit 0 of I to b
      2: b = I[1]; // Assign bit 1 of I to b
      3: b = I[2]; // Assign bit 2 of I to b
      default: b = 0; // Default to 0 if I is not 1,2 or 3
    endcase
  end
  initial #100 $stop; // Stop simulation
endmodule
```

Please note that the code given is a simple example. In a real-world scenario, you would need to consider other aspects like design methodology, architecture, data-flow, timing constraints, etc. to select the best design solution. Also, consider using a `for loop` instead of `while` for generating pulse repetitively. 

The `always @(*)` block is used to create a combinational logic block that reacts to all changes in the design. The `case` statement allows for multiple conditions to be verified and different actions to be taken.

The `default` case is used to specify what should happen when none of the cases listed in the `case` statement are true. In this case, if I is not 1, 2, or 3, the default action is to assign 0 to b.

The updated code creates a series of pulses of width 100 time units. Each time unit is separated by a single clock cycle. This means that, after 100 time units, the simulation stops. The sequence of pulses is generated in a non-intuitive manner (as per the original code) to demonstrate the different cases of array indexing.

This code creates the pulses based on the value of `I`, and the value is determined inside the `always @(*)` block that captures changes in the design. This is a more modern way to write Verilog code that doesn't require the use of registers or initial blocks, which are less common in modern Verilog designs. If you still prefer to use the original code, it should be fine provided you make sure that the loop is properly implemented. As of now, it
