```verilog
module counter (
    input wire clk, rst,
    output wire [3:0] count,
    output wire [1:0] count_msb
);

reg [3:0] count_reg;
wire [1:0] count_msb_wire;

// Add inside with array slice
initial begin
    count_reg = 4'b0000;
end

always @(posedge clk or posedge rst) begin
    if (rst) count_reg <= 4'b0000;
    else count_reg <= count_reg + 1;
end

assign count = count_reg;
assign count_msb = count_reg[3:2];  // Assign the most significant 2 bits of the count register to count_msb

endmodule
```
This modified code will have a count register, which is reset to 0 at the start of the simulation, and it will increment by one every clock cycle. The most significant 2 bits of the count register are also assigned to the count_msb wire, which can be used elsewhere in the design. The original count wire is also kept as a continuous waveform output of the count register. Note that this is a simple design to demonstrate the functionality. In a real-world application, you might have additional circuitry to handle the output, like multiplexing or simply routing it to another module.
