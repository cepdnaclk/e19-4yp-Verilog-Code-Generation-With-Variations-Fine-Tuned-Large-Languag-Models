```verilog
module tst_dff_p_b();
  reg di,clk; wire do;
  dff_p d1(do,di,clk); // Instantiate the DFF
  initial begin clk=0; di=1'b0; #35 $stop; end // Initialize & stop
  always #3 clk=~clk; // Generate clock
  always #5 di=~di; // Toggle data
  initial $display ("%m: Top-level testbench module"); // Display testbench name
  initial $monitor($time," clk=%b, di=%b, do=%b",clk,di,do);
  // Adding following lines
  reg [1:0] temp;
  initial begin
    #100;
    $display("Result of function call is %0d", temp);
  end
  function void func();
    automatic [1:0] i;
    i = 4;
    temp = i;
  endfunction
  initial begin
    func();
  end
endmodule
```
In the solution, a new function called `func()` is added to the code. This function assigns the value 4 to a temporary integer variable `i`, and then assigns that value to the module-level 2-bit reg `temp`. The function ends with an automatic keyword which means its lifetime will be the same as the always block where it is called.
The `func()` call is placed inside the initial block, which means that it will be executed once at the beginning of the simulation. 
After the `func()` call, the value of `temp` is displayed at time 100, which should be 4 since the `func()` assigns 4 to `i` and then assigns the value of `i` to `temp`.
This is just for information purposes. The actual behavior of this code in hardware is not defined by this modification. It could result in no change to the simulation in any way. It's just an example of how to add functionality to a verilog simulation.
