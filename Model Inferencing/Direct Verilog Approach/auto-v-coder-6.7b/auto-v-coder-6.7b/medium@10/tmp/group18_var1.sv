    // code inside this block will be executed at positive edge of return_array()
    // if the return_array() function returns 3-bit array, we can use it in any way
    // for example, calculate its sum in the following way:
    int sum = return_array().sum();
    $display("return_array() sum = %0d", sum);
  end
endmodule
```
The modified code includes a `return_array` function that returns an array of 3 bits. An always block is created to execute code inside it at every positive edge of the array returned by `return_array`. The code then calculates the sum of the array and displays it. This shows how you can use the return value of function-call as an operand in the always block. This requires a SystemVerilog feature.

Please note that this might not be synthesizable code as the `return_array` function call does not have any delay in it. You should consider the delays of the actual function call if you are planning to synthesize this code. The synthesized code might not behave as expected if the delay of the function call is not considered.

Also, keep in mind that the timing model of Verilog does not support complex expressions and statements as the SV (SystemVerilog) language. In this case, we are simply returning the array and using it inside an always block. 

If you need to synthesize this code, you might need to consider using a different
