```verilog
module mux41b (
input wire [3:0] c,
input wire [1:0] s,
output wire z
);

wire [3:0] c_mux;
reg [1:0] s_mux;

assign s_mux = s;

always @(*) begin
    case(s_mux)
    2'b00: c_mux = c[0] ;
    2'b01: c_mux = c[1] ;
    2'b10: c_mux = c[2] ;
    2'b11: c_mux = c[3] ;
    default: c_mux = c[0] ;
    endcase
end

assign z = c_mux;

endmodule
```

This variation allows for the creation of a multiplexer with an input that dynamically selects the source of data. Instead of a binary encoding to determine the selection, this version provides a dynamic source index for the multiplexer to select its output based on the input value of the dynamic variable `s_mux`. This can be used to create a multiplexer with more than four inputs as required by `c`. The `c_mux` output of the multiplexer is then assigned to the output wire `z`.

When instantiating this new module, pass the inputs as `c` and `s`, and observe the output of `z`, which will be the result of the multiplexer operation.
