```verilog
timescale 1ns/100ps
module ShiftRegister8 (input sl, sr, clk, input [7:0] ParIn, input [2:0] m, output reg [7:0] ParOut);
always @(negedge clk) begin
    case (1'b1)
        m inside {[0:0]}: ParOut <= ParOut;
        m inside {[1:1]}: ParOut <= {sl, ParOut[7:1]};
        m inside {[2:2]}: ParOut <= {ParOut[6:0], sr};
        m inside {[3:3]}: ParOut <= ParIn;
        default: ParOut <= 8'bX;
    endcase
end
endmodule
```

This variation code changes the case statement to take a packed vector array input that represents the dynamic range list. When `m` matches one of these values, the appropriate bit value based on the index is stored into `ParOut`. This variation reduces the code complexity and provides a convenient way to handle the cases dynamically.

Please be aware that this code doesn't handle the case when `m` is not in the defined ranges. This is a limitation of using the inside operator for packed vectors. In real-world applications, additional coding is required to handle possible value errors.

Please note: The original code logic should work fine as well. It's just a bit more concise to use inside operator. The following code is a valid syntax as well:

```verilog
timescale 1ns/100ps
module ShiftRegister8 (input sl, sr, clk, input [7:0] ParIn, input [2:0] m, output reg [7:0] ParOut);
always @(negedge clk) begin
    if (m == 0) begin
        ParOut <= ParOut;
    end else if (m == 1) begin
        ParOut <= {sl, ParOut[7:1]};
    end else if (m == 2) begin
        ParOut <= {ParOut[6:0], sr};
    end else if (m == 3) begin
        ParOut <= ParIn;
    end else begin
