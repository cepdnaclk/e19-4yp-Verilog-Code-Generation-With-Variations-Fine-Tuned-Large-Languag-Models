```verilog
module mux41b (
input wire [3:0] c,
input wire [1:0] s,
output reg z
);

always @(*) begin
  case(s)
    2'b00 : z = c[0];
    2'b01 : z = c[1];
    2'b10 : z = c[2];
    2'b11 : z = c[3];
    default : z = 1'bz;
  endcase
end
endmodule
```

This variation is similar to the original but adds a dynamic selection of c elements using the case statement inside an always block for each possible value of s. The selected element is then assigned to output wire z. This allows for greater flexibility in selection control logic, especially when multiple selection conditions are required. In this code, the case statement is used to select an element from the input array c based on the value of s. If an unrecognized value of s is provided, the output z is left high impedance (indicated by 1'bz). It provides a more flexible and dynamic way to select elements based on the given conditions. 

This variation is especially useful when a mux has multiple selections that are not explicitly enumerated in the select lines, or when a switch or priority encoder needs to be used for selection. 

Please note that the selected element is of type reg and has a default high impedance state of 1'bz. In Verilog, a high impedance state means the output is not driven. In most cases, this is desirable for combinational logic as it prevents unintentional changes to the output when the input is not stable. However, as the output is driven, it will take the value of the selected c element. If you need to keep the output zero or one regardless of the value of c, use reg instead of output wire. In general, using reg for combinational logic outputs may result in unintended behaviour.### End of Instruction.```verilog
