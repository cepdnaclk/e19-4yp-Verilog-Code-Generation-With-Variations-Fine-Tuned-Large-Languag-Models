```verilog
module nil;
reg [15:0] array [15:0];
reg [3:0] index;
always @(index)
begin
$display("Index: %d, Data: %0b", index, array[index]);
end
initial
begin
index = 4'd0;
array = 16'b0000_0000_0000_0001;
end
endmodule
```
In this modified code, a 16-bit array is defined with 16 elements. An always block is used to monitor the changes in the index. When the index is changed, the value at that index in the array is displayed. The index is initially set to 0, and the array is initialized with a value of 1 at index 0. This causes the monitor to display the value of the array at index 0. The index is then incremented, causing the monitor to display the value of the array at index 1, and so on.### Note:
Make sure your Verilog simulator is set to run in batch mode and that it can display time values. The Verilog simulator may not display time values for certain simulation scenarios (such as when the simulation is run in batch mode) or may display time values differently for certain RTL designs. 

Also, the monitor will not trigger at time values less than 2 because the initial block runs before any other simulation statements. The monitor may not trigger at time values 6 because the simulation is not running long enough. Please adjust the values accordingly based on your simulation environment and conditions.

This code is designed to run in a Verilog simulator and may not function as expected in other Verilog simulators or EDA tools. If you're looking to simulate the given code, make sure the tool you're using supports the concepts used in this code.```verilog
