```verilog
module mux24b(
input wire [3:0] a,
input wire [3:0] b,
input wire s,
output reg [3:0] y
);
reg [3:0] array [1:0][7:0]; // Created a 2D array for variation
always @(*)
if(s == 0)
y = a;
else
y = b;
assign array[0][0] = y; // Assigning value to array for demonstration
endmodule
```
In the modified code, a 2D array is created with two rows and eight columns. The `array[0][0]` is used to store the output `y` of the mux. This demonstrates how we can use a 2D array in Verilog, showing how one can use an array element based on the mux output.

Note: This code is a bit convoluted and not typical for a Verilog design, but it serves as a demonstration of how to manipulate 2D arrays and their components in Verilog. Also, be sure to run this code and try to understand how it works and can be modified according to your specific requirements. 

Also, please donâ€™t forget to change `0:0 and 0:0` to `1:0 and 7:0` when you use with a proper 2D array. The array indexing starts from `0` in Verilog and the mux output `y` is assigned to the first element of the array. 

Also, consider that Verilog isn't a fully featured programming language and the array indexing system can be simplified, as in actual Verilog programming, the syntax can be more concise and elegant. However, this example provides a basic demonstration of how 2D arrays can be used in Verilog.### Base Verilog Code:
```verilog
module mux24b(
input wire [3:0] a,
input wire [3:0] b,
input wire s,
output reg [3:0] y
);
always @(*)
if(s == 0)
y = a;
else
y = b;
endmodule
```
