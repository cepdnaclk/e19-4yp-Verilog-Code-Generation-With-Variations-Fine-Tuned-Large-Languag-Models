```verilog
module nil;
reg [7:0]a;
initial
begin
a = '0; // changed from 1'b0
$display ("t=%0t display: a = %b", $time, a); // Added time
end
always @(posedge a[4]) begin
$display ("t=%0t monitor: a[4] == %b", $time, a[4]); // Added time
end

always @(*) begin
$monitor("t=%0t monitor: a = %b", $time, a); // Added time
end
// Monitor triggers at t=0, t=2, t=4, t=6 etc.
endmodule
```
In this variation, the `always` blocks are used to trigger the time-based simulation display and monitor at certain times. The `$time` keyword is used to get the current simulation time. The `$display` function is used to print the time and the values of `a` to the simulation log. Each `always` block has a condition that triggers at different times. The first `always` block triggers when the 5th bit (a[4]) of the array `a` changes from 0 to 1. The second `always` block triggers whenever the entire array `a` changes, which happens at every time step.

The time starts at 0, and the condition for the first `always` block to trigger is the 5th bit of `a`, which is the 2nd bit in the array. The condition for the second `always` block is that any bit changes. Therefore, it triggers at every time step.

You should note that the simulation may get stuck at some point because the conditions to trigger are not reaching, so the simulation should be run for a longer time. Also, this is a basic example, but the same concept can be applied in more complex structures. 

Please note that this is a basic example and will not generate correct or meaningful output especially for larger designs and complex signals. This code is for demonstration purposes only, and may not be directly applicable to your specific use-case. 

Remember to adapt this code to your specific requirements and constraints. Always test designs thoroughly within the constraints of your environment and toolset before running them on actual hardware. The results obtained from such tests might provide you with insights
