    if (!Sel)
        Q <= D0;
    else
        Q <= D1;
endmodule

module main_module(input [7:0] data, input sel, input clk, output reg [7:0] q);
    reg [7:0] q_reg;
    integer i;
    muxdff mux0[7:0] (.D0(data[i]),.D1(sel),.Sel(sel),.Clock(clk),.Q(q_reg[i]));
    initial begin
        while(i<8) begin
            #1; //time delay
            i = i + 1;
        end
        q = q_reg;
    end
endmodule
```

### Testing:
This code is using a Verilog testbench to test the muxdff module. The muxdff module is designed to handle two different inputs (D0 and D1) and select between them based on a control bit (Sel). The Clock input is used as the clock signal, while Q is the output.

The testbench creates a packed array of 8 elements and initializes it with some values. It then initializes another packed array of 8 elements to store the output from the muxdff module. It cycles through the 8 elements of the input array, setting Sel to 0 or 1 alternatively, and simulating clock transitions. Finally, it prints the final value of the output array.

Please note that the use of Verilog is more suitable for hardware design than for algorithmic modeling. The use of a while loop in combination with a clock is not a typical use case in Verilog. It might be better suited to use a for loop and `wait` command in a task to create a more realistic simulation environment.
Also, the code might not run as expected because you have not given any values for the input `data` and `sel`. As a result, you should provide the values for these inputs before running the simulation.
