```verilog
timescale 1ns/100ps
module ShiftRegister8 (input sl, sr, clk, input [7:0] ParIn, input [1:0] m, output reg [7:0] ParOut);
always @(negedge clk) begin
    case (m)
        0: ParOut <= ParOut;
        1: ParOut <= {sl, ParOut[7:1]};
        2: ParOut <= {ParOut[6:0], sr};
        3: ParOut <= ParIn;
        default: ParOut <= 8'bX;
    endcase
end
endmodule
```
The added instruction would be:
```verilog
12'b000000000000: ParOut <= ParOut;
12'b000000000001: ParOut <= {sl, ParOut[7:1]};
12'b000000000010: ParOut <= {ParOut[6:0], sr};
12'b000000000011: ParOut <= ParIn;
```
This addition is using a packed vector array select used with the inside operator to match against a dynamic range list. The range list can be 12'b000000000000 to 12'b000000000011. This allows for a simple and efficient way to use a case statement for multiple values within the same case statement, without increasing the size of the code.

Keep in mind that you'll need to adjust the case statement to match the specific range of the packed vector array select, otherwise it may not behave as expected. 

Also, be mindful that this may not work as expected if the packed vector array select is not a power of 2. This is because the case statement is implemented as a binary search, and if the array is not in sorted order, the binary search may be incorrect.

Lastly, the case statement does not handle all possible input values. You may need to add more case statements based on the range of the packed vector array select to handle all possible values.
