// Case block with variable index
always @(*) begin
    case(s)
        2'b00: z = c_select[0];
        2'b01: z = c_select[1];
        2'b10: z = c_select[2];
        2'b11: z = c_select[3];

In this code, we have a case block that checks the values of the `s` input. If `s` matches a certain pattern, the corresponding value in the `c` input is assigned to `z`. This gives us a dynamic mux based on the values of `s` and `c`. Note that if the case statement doesn't match any of the patterns, it defaults to assigning 0 to `z`. This is a common way to do multiplexers in Verilog.

You can copy this code and run it in a simulator to see the functionality. If you want to test this code, be sure to simulate with different inputs to `c` and `s`. The code is written in Verilog as per the original task. 

Please let me know if you need more assistance in this.

NOTE: This code assumes that the `s` input is binary. If it's a gray code or any other form of input, you may need to adjust the code accordingly.

NOTE: This code does not use the `always@(*)` construct, which is usually discouraged for complex design because of its sensitivity list. However, this code is simple enough for its purpose and it should work fine in a synthesizable design. In general, using `always@(*)` when there are no specific cases (like here) leads to better optimization.

NOTE: The above Verilog code is written for synthesis. However, the above logic can be easily implemented using the `wire` keyword in Verilog. Also, in
