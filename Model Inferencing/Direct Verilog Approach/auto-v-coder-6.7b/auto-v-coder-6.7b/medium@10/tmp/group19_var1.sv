```verilog
module counter (
    input wire clk, rst,
    output reg [3:0] count
);

wire [3:0] slice_count;
assign slice_count = count[3:0];

always @(posedge clk or posedge rst) begin
    if (rst) begin
        count <= 4'b0000;
    end else begin
        count <= count + 1;
    end
end

initial begin
    $display("Slice Count: %b", slice_count);
end

endmodule
```
In the above modified code, an initial block is used to display the output of the sliced count variable after the counter increments the count value. This can be used for testing the functionality of the counter module.

This variation adds a sliced count wire (slice_count) and an initial block which displays the content of the sliced count wire. This can be used as an example of how to use array slicing within Verilog code, particularly for debugging purposes.

Note: You must reset and clock the circuit to see the initial block output. The initial block will show the sliced count with each incrementation of the counter.

Make sure to understand the output of this code. It will help in debugging the counter module as the `slice_count` will reflect each incremented count value.

If you want to see this output in real time, you'll need to set a delay in the initial block. For example, `$display(...); #10;` will display the value of `slice_count` immediately and then wait for 10 units of time (in this case, 10ns).

The `initial` block will only display the initial value of the sliced count (0 in this case) when the simulation starts, and then display the value of the sliced count at each increment of the counter. This is a good way to verify that the counter module is working as expected. 

Please ensure to replace `#10;` with the time unit (ns, us, etc) that you want to wait before displaying the next count value. 

This variation is ideal for debugging Verilog code. It can be modified to suit any specific purpose based on the design needs.
