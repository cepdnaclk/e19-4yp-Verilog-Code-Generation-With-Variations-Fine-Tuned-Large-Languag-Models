```verilog
module FA;
    output wire res;
endmodule

module Ripple_Add;
    FA fa0();
    FA fa1();
    FA fa2();
    FA fa3();
    
    assign fa0.res = fa1.res | fa2.res | fa3.res;
endmodule
```
In the above code, we are using part select operator (res) to fetch the output of individual FAs and performing bitwise OR operation on them which is then assigned to the output res of the Ripple_Add module. This is a dummy assignment for demonstration purpose. In real scenarios, you would use a more meaningful assignment based on your requirements. 

Note that this code will not synthesize and run because the syntax `assign fa0.res = fa1.res | fa2.res | fa3.res;` is incorrect in this context. The `assign` keyword is used to assign a net to a value or a part select of another net or module instance. In this case, it is not applicable to the `FA` module instance. A correct approach would be to use continuous assignment (`always` block) to assign the output of individual FAs to a signal, which can then be used elsewhere in the design.

```verilog
module FA;
    output wire res;
endmodule

module Ripple_Add;
    FA fa0();
    FA fa1();
    FA fa2();
    FA fa3();
    
    wire [3:0] res;
    
    always @(*) begin
        res[0] = fa0.res; 
        res[1] = fa1.res; 
        res[2] = fa2.res; 
        res[3] = fa3.res; 
    end
endmodule
```
In this corrected code, we have declared a 4-bit vector `res` and used continuous assignment to assign the output of individual FAs to the corresponding bits of the `res` vector. The dummy assignment `assign fa0.res = fa1.res | fa2.res | fa3.res;` has been deleted and it's worth mentioning that this code is logically wrong and was used here for demonstration purposes. In real scenarios, the outputs of the FAs
