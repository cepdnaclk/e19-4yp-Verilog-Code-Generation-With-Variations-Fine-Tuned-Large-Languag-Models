input x1, x2, x3, Clock;

In this variation, we are using an array of size 2 to store the values of x2 and x3. This allows us to select the elements of the array dynamically based on an index. The index is decided by a dynamic variable, which in this case is the value of `x1`. If `x1` is `1'b0`, the first element of the array (x2) is selected. If `x1` is `1'b1`, the second element of the array (x3) is selected. The output `f` and `g` are then calculated as follows:

- If `x1` is `1'b0`, `f = x1 & x2` and `g = f | x3`.

- If `x1` is `1'b1`, `f = x1 & x3` and `g = f | x2`.

This variation significantly reduces the number of logic gates used in the combinational logic part of the circuit, making it more efficient for synthesis.
