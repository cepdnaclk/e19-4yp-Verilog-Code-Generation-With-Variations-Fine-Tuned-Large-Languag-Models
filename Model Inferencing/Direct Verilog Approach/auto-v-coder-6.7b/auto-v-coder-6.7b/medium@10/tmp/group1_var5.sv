```verilog
timescale 1ns/100ps
module ShiftRegister8 (input sl, sr, clk, input [7:0] ParIn, input [1:0] m, output reg [7:0] ParOut);
always @(negedge clk) begin
    case (m)
        0: ParOut <= ParOut;
        1: ParOut <= {sl, ParOut[7:1]};
        2: ParOut <= {ParOut[6:0], sr};
        3: ParOut <= ParIn;
        default: ParOut <= 'X;
    endcase
end
endmodule
```
In this modified code, the assignment to 'ParOut' is changed to a single quote 'X' to indicate that the 'ParOut' should be in an undefined state. This modification will handle the undefined state scenario by setting the output to an 'x'. The `'X` in Verilog is a shorthand for a vector of 'x'. It can be used to represent an undefined or default state.
