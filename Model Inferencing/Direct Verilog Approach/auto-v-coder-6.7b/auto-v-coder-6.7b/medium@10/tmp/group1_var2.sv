This modified version of the code will take a 2-bit input m and decode it into a binary logic combination with the inside operator. The inside operator is an alternative way of handling dynamic ranges in a case statement. ### Note: If you want to dynamically select multiple bits of the input m, I'd recommend using the packed vector array select ({var[1:0], var[3:2]}). ### This code will produce the same output as its original counterpart, but it allows for a more precise control flow.### Also, please note that the new code may behave as expected until there are overlapping cases in the case statement. It is always a good practice to make sure your case statements are exhaustive and do not have overlaps.```verilog
