```verilog
module ha_8(s,ca,a,b,x); // Half Adder with if condition and array slice expression
  input a,b; output s,ca;
  input packed logic [3:0] x [2];

  // check if x is in range 0-3
  if (x[0][2:0] inside {[0:3]}) begin
  // Half Adder code
  specify
    specparam dl1 = 1; // Define specify parameter for s delay
    specparam dl2 = dl1 + 1; // Define specify parameter for ca delay based on dl1
    // Assign path delays using specparams
    (a, b *> s) = dl1;
    (a, b *> ca) = dl2;
  endspecify
  xor (s,a,b);
  and (ca,a,b);
  end
endmodule
```

This version of the code first checks whether the lower 3 bits of the 1st element of the array `x` are within the range of 0 to 3. If the condition is met, it continues with the regular Half Adder code, otherwise, it does nothing. The if condition can be used with any expressions and conditions that can be evaluated in Verilog.

Please note that:
1. This variation assumes the input `x` is packed logic 4D array.
2. This variation assumes that the "inside" keyword is not used as a part of the Verilog syntax.
3. The half adder code is executed under the condition. It's a simple example and does not handle any conditions. You may need to modify it to suit your needs.
4. In simulation, it's important to note that Verilog does not support if conditions in module instantiation. This code should be used for RTL simulation or formal verification purposes only. 

For synthesis and place & route, you'll need to use a Verilog-specific tool, where the if condition can be handled or converted to other possible synthesizable constructs. This process would differ based on the specific synthesis tools, not just Verilog.
