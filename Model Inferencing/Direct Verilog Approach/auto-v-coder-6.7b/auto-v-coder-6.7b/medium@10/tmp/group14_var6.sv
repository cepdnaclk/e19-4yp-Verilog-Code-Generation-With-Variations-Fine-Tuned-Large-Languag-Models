```verilog
module mux21b (
input wire [1:0][1:0] a,  // input packed 2D array
input wire s,
output reg [1:0] y // Output must be reg for procedural assignment
);
always @(*) // Combinational sensitivity
begin
case (s)
    0: y = a[0]; // Select a[0] if s=0 (highest priority)
    1: y = a[1]; // Select a[1] if s=1
    default: y = a[1];  // Default to a[1]
endcase
end
endmodule
```

In the above code, `a` is a 2D array with 2 rows and 2 columns. The selection priority is that the highest priority is given to `a[0]` if `s` is 0, and `a[1]` otherwise (meaning `s=1`). If no condition is met, the default action will be to select `a[1]`. This can be adjusted according to your need.

The output is also a 2D array with 2 rows and 1 column, to match the input. The selected rows from the input array are assigned to the output array. 

Remember to specify a default value, as the case statement can only handle a specific number of cases, and not a range of cases. The `default:` label is placed at the end to handle any other case that isn't covered by the specific cases. The default value is set to `a[1]` as it's a safe choice, but can be replaced as per specific requirements.\(\)
