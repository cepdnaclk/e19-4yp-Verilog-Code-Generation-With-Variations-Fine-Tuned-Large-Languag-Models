This code introduces another control signal o along with existing control signals o1 and o2. This new signal is an AND of o1 and o2. This new signal is used inside the case statement in the always block to decide the value of signal o. This logic is derived based on the truth table of NOR gate.

Adding of the new control signal can cause some optimization issues in synthesis, but will not affect the correctness of the design.

The added case statement will be synthesized to a multiplexer with 4 inputs and 2 select inputs if your synthesis tool supports that. The multiplexer will be used to control the value of the output o based on the values of inputs a1 and a2. The value of o will depend on the values of a1, a2, b1, and b2. 

The case statement also includes the necessary logic to make sure the output will be correctly calculated based on the values of the inputs. It can be adjusted or removed as per requirement.

This new control signal is used to demonstrate the usage of packed arrays in Verilog, and it also serves to demonstrate the use of case statement in Ver
