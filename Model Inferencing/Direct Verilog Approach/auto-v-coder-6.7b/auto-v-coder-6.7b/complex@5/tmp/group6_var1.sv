```verilog
module mux4to1(w0, w1, w2, w3, S, f);
input w0, w1, w2, w3;
input [1:0] S;
output f;
reg f;
reg [1:0] valid_sel = {2{1'b1}}; // {2{1'b1}} is the same as {1'b1, 1'b1}
always @(w0 or w1 or w2 or w3 or S)
    if (S inside {valid_sel}) // Compare S with valid_sel
        f = S[0]? (S[1]? w3 : w2) : (S[1]? w1 : w0); // Implementing the mux logic
    else
        f = 1'bz; // Default value for unselected cases
endmodule
```
This code assigns the output `f` according to the multiplexer input `S`. By using `inside`, we can simplify the code and improve readability. The condition now checks if `S` is in the valid_sel array. If it is, it assigns the output `f` based on the multiplexer control input `S`. If it's not, it leaves the output `f` in high-impedance state (Z).### Important Note:
This version of the code is logically equivalent to the initial code, but with improved readability and the use of `inside`. The original code was already logically equivalent to this code, so there's no need to modify it for functionality. However, in general, such variations can make the code more readable and compact, particularly for complex or long multiplexers. If the intention was to reduce the number of comparators and gates, this variation may be beneficial. However, in this case, using `inside` might add unnecessary complexity to the code. ### Note:
The usage of `inside` syntax in Verilog is a specific syntax supported by some tools/simulators. It's not universally supported. If you're using a simulator or a tool that doesn't support this syntax, you'll need to use a different approach to compare bits in the `S` input. For example, you could use
