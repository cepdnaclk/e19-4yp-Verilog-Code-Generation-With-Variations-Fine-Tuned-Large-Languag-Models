This code introduces the `always` block with a `#10` delay before toggling `pr` to `1'b1`, and another `#12` delay before toggling it back to `1'b0`. This is designed to mimic the async preset behavior where `pr` is not asserted at the same time as `di`, causing the `q` output to remain in the same state until `pr` is toggled. When `di` changes, the output of `q` immediately changes but the async preset does not immediately override it.

Please note, in the above code, `dffalter` is assumed to be the name of the DFF and `dut` is the instance of the `dffalter`. Replace `dffalter` with the actual name of your DFF and `dut` with the actual instance of your DFF.
