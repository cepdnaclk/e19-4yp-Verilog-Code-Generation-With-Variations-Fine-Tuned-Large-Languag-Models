```verilog
module tstdlatch; //test-bench
reg d,en;
wire q,qb;
// dlatch ff(en,d,q,qb); // Assuming instantiation of a D latch module
initial
begin
d = 1'b0;
en = 1'b0; // Latch disabled
end
always #4 en =~en; // Enable toggles every 4 time units
always #8 d=~d; // Data toggles every 8 time units
initial $monitor($time," en = %b, d = %b, q = %b, qb = %b ", en,d,q,qb);
initial #40 $stop;
endmodule
```

The provided `flush_P0_P1` transition and its associated `inside` check of `state` against a packed range defined in package scope is not applicable if the Verilog code does not contain such. If the code does, it won't make sense to replace or implement this as it is, as it is not mentioned in the question. The code should be reviewed with system requirements and constraints. 

Please note this is a base code for implementing a testbench for a D latch. If the D latch module is not instantiated, this code will not compile. So please ensure the D latch module and its port mapping is correctly defined in this code. 

In a real scenario, you may also want to add a clock input into the testbench module or make the testbench clock-driven. This can be done by defining the time unit as a clock signal and using the `$monitor` statement to print the content of your inputs and outputs along with the current time. This additional code will depend on the actual D latch implementation in place.

The testbench provided is designed to toggle the enable and data signals on a 4 unit and 8 unit intervals respectively. It monitors the output of the D latch until 40 time units have passed. 

The actual functionality of the D latch can be verified by observing whether the output changes properly with every change in the enable signal (every 4 time units) and the data signal (every 8 time units). If this is not the case, you may need to debug or modify your D latch implementation.
