Here is the modified code:

```verilog
interface interface_name;
parameter constant_name = 1;
endinterface

module d_ff (input d, clk, s, r, output reg q, q_b );
always @( s ) begin : force_a_1
if ( s inside {constant_name} ) begin
end else begin
deassign q;
deassign q_b;
end
end
always @( r ) begin : force_a_0
if( r ) begin
end else begin
deassign q;
deassign q_b;
end
end
always @( posedge clk ) begin : clocked
end
endmodule
```

This modified code will now only deassert `q` and `q_b` if `s` is equal to the `constant_name` declared in the interface. Please replace `interface_name`, `constant_name` with your actual interface name and constant.

Remember that this check will only be performed on the next delta cycle after `s` value is updated, which could delay your simulation result by one cycle.
  
The `deassign` command will not affect the simulation result unless you are using some specific tool that supports the `deassign` command. If you are using a simulator that does not support it, you may need to use `release` instead. This command will force the signal to be driven to an undefined state.
  
Please, also note that `deassign` may lead to undefined behaviours if not used correctly. It should be used with caution. If possible, consider using logic and a reset instead.
  
If you are doing any kind of synthesis, ensure that your design does not require these kinds of checks. Such actions should be considered for simulations only.
  
Also, Verilog uses the deassign command to clear the signal assignment which is equivalent to assigning the signal to a constant. Therefore, it may not be used with a non-constant value, resulting in an error. If you need to clear a signal to a non-constant value, consider using the `release` command. 

Thus, if you need to clear a signal to a non-constant value, it's better to use `release` as follows:

```verilog
always @( r ) begin : force_a_
