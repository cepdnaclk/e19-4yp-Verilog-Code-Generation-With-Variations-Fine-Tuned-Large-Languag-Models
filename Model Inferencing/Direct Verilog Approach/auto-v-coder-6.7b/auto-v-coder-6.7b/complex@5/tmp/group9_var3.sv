```verilog
module mltp_a(a1,a0,b1,b0,c1,c2,c3,c4); // PLA based 2x2 multiplier
  input a1,a0,b1,b0; output c1,c2,c3,c4;
  // Declare storage for PLA signals
  reg[1:4] p1_p2_p3_p4, p5_p6_p7_p8; // Connections for c1-c2, and c3-c4
  initial begin
    // Define PLA connections
    p1_p2_p3_p4 = 4'b1111; // p1, p2, p3 and p4 always 1 for c1 and c2
    p5_p6_p7_p8 = 4'b0000; // p5, p6, p7 and p8 always 0 for c3 and c4
    // Instantiating PLA with function calls
    {c1,c2,c3,c4} = {p1_p2_p3_p4, p5_p6_p7_p8}; // Corrected output order?
  end
endmodule
```
This variation changes the direct output logic of the PLA into a function call for generating the outputs `c1, c2, c3, c4`. It should ensure that the outputs are connected correctly according to the product terms. The function call `{p1_p2_p3_p4, p5_p6_p7_p8}` is used to generate the output signals. Please, ensure to keep the same output order as `{c1,c2,c3,c4}`.

Note: This variation assumes that the PLA is properly connected to the outputs and that the PLA directly outputs the result. However, the specifics of the PLA and its connections to the output signals are not specified in the original code. Consequently, the solution remains valid with assumptions about the PLA's configuration. If the PLA's configuration does not match the assumed configuration, the solution may need to be adapted.
