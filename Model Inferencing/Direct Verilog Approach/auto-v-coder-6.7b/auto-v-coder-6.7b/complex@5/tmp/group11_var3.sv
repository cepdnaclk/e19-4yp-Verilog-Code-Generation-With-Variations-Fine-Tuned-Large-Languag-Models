```verilog
generate
    for( genvar s = 0; s < 2; s = s +1 ) begin : s_gen
        always begin
            if(s == 0)
                assign ttrimux2_1_out = e? i[0] : 1'bz;
            else
                assign ttrimux2_1_out = e? i[1] : 1'bz;
        end
    end : s_gen
endgenerate
```

This generates 2 identical muxes at the same time.

To test this, we may create an initial block which triggers both `s` values and check if the output is as expected. 

```verilog
initial begin
    $display("Running simulation for s=0");
    s = 0; // s=0
    #10;
    $display("Running simulation for s=1");
    s = 1; // s=1
    #10;
    $stop;
end
```

This will print the output of the mux for both s values. 
Remember to use the proper define of which mux you are testing like "ttrimux2_1_out". This code assumes that you have already defined and instantiated the `ttrimux2_1` verilog model.### Note
Please be aware that Verilog doesn't support tristate outputs directly. You can achieve similar behavior with a series of AND, OR, and NOT gates or a multiplexer (mux). The code above uses a conditional ternary operator which is common in Verilog to emulate a tristate output.### Note
Please ensure a proper testbench setup with input stimuli for the multiplexer. This code only emulates a tristate multiplexer using a conditional ternary operator.### Note
Please note that the logic is currently set to a tristate mux, so it will only output a High or Low if the input 'e' is enabled. If 'e' is disabled, it will output a High-Z.

Remember to adjust the testbench as needed and to properly define the multiplexer under test. This example assumes the multiplexer has 3 inputs (enable signal 'e', input 'i0', and input 'i1'), and 1 output 'out
