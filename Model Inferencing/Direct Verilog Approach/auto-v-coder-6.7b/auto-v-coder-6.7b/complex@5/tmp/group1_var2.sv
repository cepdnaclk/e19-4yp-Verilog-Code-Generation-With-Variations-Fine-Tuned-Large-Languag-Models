```verilog
module tst_nor3NMOS();
  reg in1,in2,in3; wire b;
  genvar i; // Declare a genvar
  generate
    for (i=0; i<3; i++) begin : \gen_block1 // Generate block with name gen_block1
      nor3NMOS nn(in1,in2,in3,b); // Instantiate NMOS NOR
    end
  endgenerate
  initial begin // Initialize inputs
    in1 = 1'b0; in2 = 1'b0; in3 = 1'b0; // Corrected: was 1'b1
  end
  // Toggle inputs at different rates
  always #2 in1 = ~in1;
  always #3 in2 = ~in2;
  always #5 in3 = ~in3;
  initial $monitor($time, "in1=%b, in2=%b, in3=%b, output=%b", in1, in2, in3, b); // Removed newline
  initial #24 $stop; // Stop simulation
endmodule
```
This variation will result in three separate NOR3 gates, connected to inputs in1, in2, and in3. Each gate's output (b) will be printed to the stdout during the simulation, showing the changes in signals. The simulation will stop after 24 time units.

Note: This code is a basic example and might not produce a visible output without an actual NMOS NOR3 device. This is due to the nature of the simulation environment, where signals are not propagated through a real NMOS gate. For meaningful simulation results, the actual device should be incorporated into the model.

Note: The instantiation of the NMOS NOR3 device is not correctly placed here. The actual device instantiation should be placed where it is intended to be used according to the design.

Note: The input toggling is written to simulate different time delays for the input signals. These delays can be adjusted as per the requirements of the design.In the above code the logic of the NMOS NOR3 is not defined. This is where you would specify the functionality of the NOR3 using Ver
