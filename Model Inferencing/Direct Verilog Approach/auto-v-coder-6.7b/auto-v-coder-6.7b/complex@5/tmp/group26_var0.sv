    HiCount = HiCount + 2'b01;

    case (HiCount)

        2'b01: Adjr = 2'b01;

This code will give an initial frequency setting of 01 Hz (1Hz) and everytime `PLLClock` becomes 1, `HiCount` increments which means the total number of 1's being generated has increased. When `HiCount` is 00, frequency increases to 11 Hz (1.5Hz), when `HiCount` is 01, frequency decreases to 01 Hz (1Hz), and when `HiCount` is 10 or higher, frequency decreases to 00 Hz (0.5Hz). `Reset` is a synchronous reset input, and it will reset `Adjr` and `HiCount` back to 01 Hz (1Hz). This means high frequency can be used to measure very short signals where signal width is less than 2 cycles. If you need long signals, you may need to add more states in the frequency adjustment system. 

It's important to note that `reg` and `output` have been replaced with `reg` and `output reg` in this code as per Verilog's syntax rules, and also the `inside` keyword has been changed to `if` condition to match with the Verilog language.
In addition, the `always` block has been updated to add `input` in the sensitivity list for
