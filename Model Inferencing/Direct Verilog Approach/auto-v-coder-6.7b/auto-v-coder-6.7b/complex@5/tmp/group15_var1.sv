The code modifies the original module to include a reset signal. The counter will reset to zero when `rst` is asserted. It also uses a parameter `RST_X` for a reset value. By default, `RST_X` is set to `1'b0`. If you want to change the reset value, just replace `RST_X` with your specific value. It's also a good practice to include an appropriate test case to check for counter reset.

Lastly, it's best to test the reset functionality by asserting `rst` in the testbench.

Please note that the simulation speed was increased for the verification of this change. Please adjust the simulation speed based on your system's capability.

This modified code includes necessary conditions to ensure that the testbench can pass all the specified tests.

The updated `tst_updcounter` module now includes the `rst` signal and an always block to check for reset. `rst` signal is set to `RST_X` in the initial block. It then resets the `a` counter to zero whenever `rst` becomes `1'b1`. The new `rst` signal is connected to the
