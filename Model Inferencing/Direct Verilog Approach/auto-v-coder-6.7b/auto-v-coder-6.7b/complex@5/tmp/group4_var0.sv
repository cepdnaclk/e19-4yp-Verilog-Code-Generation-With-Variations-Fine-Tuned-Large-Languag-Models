```verilog
module tst_ctr_wt;
reg clk,En;
reg[3:0]N;
wire[3:0]a;

// Define a task to use inside the generate block
task ctr_task;
	input int index;
	ctr_wt c1(a[index],clk,N,En);
endtask

initial begin
	clk = 0; N = 4'b1111; // Set limit to 15
	En = 1'b0; // Start disabled
end

always #35 $stop; // Stop simulation

generate
	for(genvar i=0; i<4; i++) begin: ctr
		ctr_task(.index(i));
	end
endgenerate

initial $monitor($time, ", clk = %b, En = %b, N = %d", clk, En, N); // Corrected format specifiers
endmodule
```
In the modified code, we have replaced `ctr_wt c1(a[index],clk,N,En);` with `ctr_task(.index(i));`. The task is a Verilog construct that groups a set of code into a reusable piece of code. It is equivalent to a function in C or C++. The `index(i)` is a parameter that the task receives and is used to select the appropriate output wire `a[index]` to connect the counter to. The generate block creates four instances of the counter, each connected to a different output wire in `a`. The `$monitor` statement inside the initial block is used for monitoring the simulation state, showing the current time, and some of the control signals.

Note: Be aware that this code makes assumptions about a Verilog-2001 design. If your tool doesn't support Verilog-2001 and/or if you're using a tool that doesn't support `generate... endgenerate` in the same way as in this example, you might need to modify the code accordingly. The main idea remains the same: use a generate block to create multiple instances of the same or similar block, and use a `task` to encapsulate the logic that you want to reuse.
