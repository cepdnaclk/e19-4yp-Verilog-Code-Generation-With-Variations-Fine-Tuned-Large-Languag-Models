In this code, the generate block checks if the width is greater than 2, if so the code inside the generate block is unrolled and the counter loops back around whenever it overflows, otherwise, the generate block is skipped. The code inside the generate block takes advantaged of the `idx` variable to loop through the position in the bit array. The `$clog2(WIDTH)-1: 0` expression is the same as `WIDTH-1: 0` for the width value, but it uses another operator `$clog2`, which returns the log base 2 of the width. This is useful in verilog to specify the range of indices in an array.joyce

The generate block is not supported by all verilog simulators, so the code may not work as expected if you need compatibility with all simulators.joyce

Remember to define the width of your counter in the `Johnson_Counter` module, change the `WIDTH` value to the number of bits you want in the counter.joyce

Please note that the generate block might
