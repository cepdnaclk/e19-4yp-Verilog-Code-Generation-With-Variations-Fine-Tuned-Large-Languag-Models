This code does the same thing as the original code, but using an array slice for the `w` signal. The `z` output is set according to the `w` input and the current state of the FSM. The state of the FSM is updated every clock cycle. The state `y` and `Y` are updated only on a positive clock edge. The reset `Resetn` is handled separately. If `Resetn` is 0, then `y` is set to `A` and `z` is set to 0. Otherwise, the state of the FSM and the value of `z` are updated based on the `w` input. If `w` changes, then `z` is updated accordingly. The `y` and `Y` are updated according to the current state of `y` and the `z` value assigned. 

This code should be run inside a Verilog environment that supports the `always` construct to define sequential logic and `if` statements for control flow. Such environments can contain arrays and may support the Verilog programming constructs required for SV class. The code is also synthesizable by a synthesis tool.
