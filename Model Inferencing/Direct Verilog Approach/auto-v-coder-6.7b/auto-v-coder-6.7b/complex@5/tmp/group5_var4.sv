The above code is almost identical to the provided code but with syntax changes for port declaration. The new code maintains all of the logic and behavior of the original code, replacing the ternary operator for the transition logic with two if-else statements. The two assignments for `z` and `Y` are placed within their respective conditionals. This version of the code is syntactically correct. It is also semantically equivalent to the original code. It's just a stylistic preference that changes one of the operators to two separate conditional branches. It is a small change, and should not affect the functionality or performance of the code. However, it's an improvement in readability and maintainability. If you prefer a more compact or concise style, you can always go with the ternary operator. 

The other part (register assignments) remains the same and is not affected by the changes.

Remember that the logic inside the FSM should be as simple as possible to avoid errors and unexpected behavior. In this case, the only changes are inside the code. The overall FSM functionality and behavior is the same. However, the change in the ternary syntax to two if-else statements affects the performance and readability, but not the functionality. We still use a combinational logic to transition states and generate output. It's just that the syntax is changed for readability.

This variation also preserves the SV syntax as it is within a Verilog module. The original code and
