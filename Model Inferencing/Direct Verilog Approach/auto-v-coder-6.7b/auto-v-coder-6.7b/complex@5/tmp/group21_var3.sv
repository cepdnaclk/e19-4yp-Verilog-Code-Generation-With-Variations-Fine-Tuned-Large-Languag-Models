This code generates the same functionality as the original code, but it uses a pre-coded memory to store the state transition logic and to select the next state. This code makes use of a fixed array to store the state transition conditions, making it more hardware-friendly and easier to verify the intended behavior. Note that the memory for this code assumes a specific state transition pattern. If the state transitions need to be dynamically decided at runtime, a more complex state machine description will be needed.

This code is still a Mealy machine, it does not contain reset, but you can add it by adding a reset input and resetting the state when reset is asserted.

Please remember to replace the 8'b00000001, 8'b00100101, 8'b00100111, 8'b00000011 with your specific state transitions. These are just placehoders for example. The correct memory should be determined based on the specific state transition logic of your sequence detector.

Also, please note that the 'inside' operator '[]' used in the original code is replaced by specific elements in an array or memory defined in the code. As such, the
