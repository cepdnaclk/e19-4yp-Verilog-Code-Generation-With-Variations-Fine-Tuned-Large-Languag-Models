In the above code, an `if` statement is added to generate an error when the `RST_X` is not in the expected range.

Please replace `my_pkg::RST_X` with your own package and variable name. The variable `RST_X` should be defined in the `my_pkg` package.

Also, ensure that your `my_pkg` package is correctly imported in the module. If your package is in a different file, you may have to adjust your include path or add a `-I` flag to the compiler command line to include the package directory.

Also, `rst_x` is now a valid signal in your design and can be directly connected to any reset signal in your design. Be sure to connect it to your reset signal in your design.

Note: This code assumes that `RST_X` is defined as a parameter in your package. If `RST_X` is defined somewhere else in
