```verilog
module tstdlatch; //test-bench
reg d,en;
wire q,qb;
// dlatch ff(en,d,q,qb); // Assuming instantiation of a D latch module
initial
begin
d = 1'b0;
en = 1'b0; // Latch disabled
end
always #4 en =~en; // Enable toggles every 4 time units
always #8 d=~d; // Data toggles every 8 time units
initial $monitor($time," en = %b, d = %b, q = %b, qb = %b ", en,d,q,qb);
initial #40 $stop;
endmodule
```
In the above example, replace the comment line `// flush_P0_P1` with the code:

```verilog
always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (!rst_n)
        state <= '0;
    else
        state <= (state == '1)? '0 : (state == '0)? '1 : state;
end
```
This replaces the latch with a flip-flop (flushing D-type latch) which has the ability to store the data when `en` is high. The `rst_n` signal is a reset input that resets the `state` to '0. This can be used to disable the latched state of the flip-flop. As always, it is recommended to replace `en` with an actual enable signal and replace `clk` with an actual clock signal.

Remember to include the necessary inputs and output ports in your D-type latch flip-flop instantiation.

The above code is a basic example and may not cover the complete requirements. There are many variations and configurations for D-type latch flip-flops depending on the exact functionality and timing needs of your design. So, if you had to implement a different kind of behavior or function, you'll need to alter this code accordingly.joy#```verilog
module d_type_ff(en, rst_n, d, q);
input en;
input rst_n;
input d;
output reg q;

always @(posedge en
