This testbench will validate the async preset behavior by toggling `di` and monitoring the output `q`. The output `q` is also monitored in the testbench to validate the correctness of the DFF.### This Verilog code does the following:
- Sets the initial values for the DFF inputs.
- Toggles the data `di` every 4 clock cycles.
- Assert and deassert the preset `pr` every 16 and 20 clock cycles respectively.
- Uses a loop to cycle through the values of `di` after 4 cycles delay. ### This testbench code can be further refined and enhanced based on specific requirements, such as more detailed monitoring, error checking, and coverage analysis.### Please note that the actual DFF design named `dffalter` will remain undeclared as it's not provided in the code. This design is assumed to be some form of D-flip-flop like structure. Also, make sure the package for `dffalter` is correctly declared in your Veril
