This code will check the inside of the shift register at each clock edge using the constant array and will generate assertions to ensure that the shift register output matches one of the expected values. Please note that this will not actually synthesize (or simulate) as `generate`-`for` loops are not supported in Verilog-2005 and earlier (like synthesized by Icarus Verilog or other simulators). These are just comments and are not actual part of Verilog code. For synthesis, you should use Verilog-2005 or later. Please ensure that the code snippet is compatible with your target synthesis tool: Icarus Verilog, Yosys, Alchitry and other tools. And also check the version of
