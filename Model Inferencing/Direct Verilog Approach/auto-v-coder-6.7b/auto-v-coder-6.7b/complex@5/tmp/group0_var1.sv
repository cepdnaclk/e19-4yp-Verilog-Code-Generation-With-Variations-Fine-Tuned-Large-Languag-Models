```verilog
module tst_or_gate();
reg[3:0] a;
reg en;
wire b;
or_gate gg(b,a,en);
initial
begin
a = 4'h0; // Initialize input
en = 1'b0; // Initialize enable
end
initial begin // Stimulus generation
#5 a = 4'h1; // Change input after 5 ns
end
initial $monitor("t=%0d, en = %b, a = %h, b = %b",$time,en,a,b); // Use %h for hex 'a'
initial #30 $stop; // Stop simulation
endmodule
```
This is a simple example to show you how to instantiate an array slice, modify the value and display the result.

In the case of `a`, it's tested with a modification after 5 ns. This is done by using the `#5` delay in the simulation flow. The `$monitor` statement is used to display the values of time, `en`, `a`, and `b`. The `$stop` statement is used to end the simulation after 30 ns, which is specified by `#30 $stop;`.

Make sure to replace `or_gate` and `4'h1` with your actual or gate implementation and the value for the variable 'a' you want to test. You can also change the time and the way you want to change the value of 'a'. The code is provided as is, not as a function to test different array slices. It just gives you the idea of doing it in case you want to do so. The actual `or_gate` needs to be implemented in your design in a different module.

You might also need to adjust the time, delay, and enable values according to your requirements. Please update the `#30 $stop;` to match your desired simulation time. Additionally, this example does not test array slices within the `or_gate`. These could be added based on the specifics of your gate and how you want to test it. This design uses `or_gate` that takes 'a' and 'en' as inputs and gives 'b' as output. 

Make sure that your `or_gate` module has a delay
