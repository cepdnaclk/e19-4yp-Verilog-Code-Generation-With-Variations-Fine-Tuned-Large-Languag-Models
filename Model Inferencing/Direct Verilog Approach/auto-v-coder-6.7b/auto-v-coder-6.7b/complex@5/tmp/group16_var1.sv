```verilog
module tb_TOP1;
  reg CLK, RST_X;
  TOP1 uut(.CLK(CLK),.RST_X(RST_X));

  initial begin
    CLK = 0;
    forever #5 CLK = ~CLK;
  end

  initial begin
    RST_X = 0; #10;
    RST_X = 1;
  end
endmodule
```
This modification keeps the base code the same as it was originally supplied, but the logic within it may be changed depending on the actual comparator's behavior. The comparator logic is designed to compare `x` against a constant array defined in a package. 

Please, replace the following line in the `TOP1` module:
```verilog
assign isSmaller = (x < COMPARE_WITH);
```
with the following one:
```verilog
assign isSmaller = (compPkg::COMPARE_WITH inside {x});
```
Where `compPkg::COMPARE_WITH` is a constant array defined in the `compPkg` package.

Note: The `inside` operator checks if a value is inside of an array. When comparing an array with a single value, this operator looks for if the value is inside the array.

Remember to import the `compPkg` package to make it available in the `TOP1` module.
```verilog
import compPkg::COMPARE_WITH;
```
This ensures that `COMPARE_WITH` is available in the `TOP1` module.

This provides a way to compare a value with a predefined array using the `inside` operator and using a package to define the array. Note that this may vary and may need to be adjusted to your specific use cases.

Also, note that the `compPkg` package and `COMPARE_WITH` array should be defined elsewhere in your code, and this is just an example.

Please make sure the correct package name and the array constant are used.

The `COMPARE_WITH` array should be changed based on your requirements, and it can be multiple values or a single value or a range of values.

Also, the array should be predefined
