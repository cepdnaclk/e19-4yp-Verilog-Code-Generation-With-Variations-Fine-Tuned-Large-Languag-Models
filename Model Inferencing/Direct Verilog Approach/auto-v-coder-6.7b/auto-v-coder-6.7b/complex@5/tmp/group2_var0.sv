```
In this code, every operation takes one clock cycle to complete. The `#100` instruction at the beginning of `Apply_Data` sets the initial state of the system. The first operand is loaded from the memory location pointed to by the `indx`, and then the `start` signal is asserted. The `@(posedge clk)` statement is a wait statement that waits for the falling edge of the clock. The falling edge is when the clock turns from a high state to a low state. The delay of 100 time units is to allow the multiplier to complete its operation. After that, the next operation is loaded onto the bus and the operation is started. The process continues for the rest of the multiplications.

In the `Multiplier uut`, the inputs are driven from the `databus` and `start`, and the outputs are driven back to the corresponding wires. The `done` signal indicates if the operation is finished. The `lsb_out` and `msb_out` are the lower and higher 8 bits of the result respectively.

This code tests the multiplier's behavior in a linear fashion on memory-based data. If you need to test the multiplier with different data or different test cases, you can modify the `mem1` and `mem2` data arrays and the `indx` value
