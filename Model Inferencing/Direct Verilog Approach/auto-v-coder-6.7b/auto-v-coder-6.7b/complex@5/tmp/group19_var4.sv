```verilog
module addern(carryin, X, Y, S, carryout);
parameter n = 16;
input carryin;
input [n-1:0] X, Y;
output [n-1:0] S;
output carryout;
wire [n-1:0] S;
reg [n:0] C;
reg carryout;
reg [n-1:0] S;
integer k;
always @(X or Y or carryin)
begin
    C[0] = carryin;
    for (k = 0; k <= n-1; k = k + 1)
    begin
        S[k] = X[k] ^ Y[k] ^ C[k];
        C[k+1] = (X[k] & Y[k]) | (C[k] & X[k]) | (C[k] & Y[k]);
    end
    carryout = C[n];
end
endmodule
```

In the above code, use `wire` instead of `output` for the result `S` to avoid the error. This is because `wire` is used when a signal is not intended to be driven by the module and will not be driven by its outputs.

Additionally, use `reg` instead of `wire` for the `S` signal inside the module. This is because `reg` is used when you want to define a register (storage element) that represents a storage cell that can be both read and written.

This variation of code should not give any synthesizable errors. Note that the `logic` type and `reg` type used in different contexts (inputs, outputs, and module internal signals) should be consistent in Verilog for a synthesizable design.

You should always ensure that the module is synthesizable as Verilog is a hardware description language and not a programming language. This ensures a reliable and fast design in terms of logic gate usage and timing. It also enables the compiler to optimize the design for a given target device.

Please ensure to run the Verilog code through a Verilog simulator if you want to verify its correctness, and ensure that the inputs it requires are properly defined and validated. This will prevent hard implementation errors.
