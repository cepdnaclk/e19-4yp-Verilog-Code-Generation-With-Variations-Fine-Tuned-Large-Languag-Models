```verilog

assign AdjustFreq = Adjr;
reg[1:0] HiCount;
always @(posedge ClockIn or posedge Reset) begin
    if (Reset==1'b1) begin
        Adjr <= 2'b01;
        HiCount <= 2'b0;
    end
    else if (PLLClock==1'b1) begin
        HiCount <= HiCount + 2'b01;
    end
    else begin
        unique case (HiCount)
            2'b00: Adjr <= 2'b11;
            2'b01: Adjr <= 2'b01;
            default: Adjr <= 2'b00;

This code does the same thing as the original, but instead of using `always` with `else if`, it uses `always @(posedge ClockIn or posedge Reset)` to handle both sensitivity list. For the case statement, `unique` is used to ensure that the selected value is unique. This is generally more efficient as it avoids a combinatorial loop that could cause problems with the synthesis tools. However, it is important to note that it may not be valid in Verilog-2005 and later since it is reserved for use within the `unique` construct. If you are using a version of Verilog that does not support `unique` within `case`, you may need a different approach to avoid combinatorial loops. As of now, most synthesis tools support this statement.

Note: Replace `posedge` and `negedge` with `edge` if you want to apply to both.

The `inside` operator is not needed here because it's not an array comparison. It is for use in `foreach` loop, which is not used in this situation. So, `inside` is not applicable in this context.### End Verilog Code.###```verilog
