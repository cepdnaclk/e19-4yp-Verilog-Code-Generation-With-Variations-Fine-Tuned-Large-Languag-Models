```verilog

wire is_A_in_range = (A>=0 & A<=15);

    case (s)
        0: F = 4'b0000;
        1: F = B - A;
        2: F = A - B;
        3: F = A + B;
        4: F = A ^ B;
        5: F = A | B;
        6: F = A & B;
        7: if (is_A_in_range) F = 4'b1111;
         else F = 4'b0000;
    endcase
endmodule
```
In the above code, a new signal `is_A_in_range` is introduced to determine whether operand A is within a specified range (0 to 15 in this case). If `is_A_in_range` is 1, the output F equals to 4'b1111; otherwise, it remains unchanged. This modification enables the program to implement additional checks or additional behavior based on the range of operands. 

This code will also provide an additional layer of protection or control flow when dealing with certain input ranges. The use of these checks should be considered to fit the specific needs of the implementation. 

Remember to adjust the condition in the check to the actual range you are looking for. In the code above, it's for the range between 0 and 15, but you can adjust this for any desired range. 

Also, the logic for checking if A is in the specified range, A>=0 & A<=15, should be adjusted according to the actual specification of the application. For example, if the range for A is different, the condition should be adjusted accordingly. 

Note: This check is meant to be a basic demonstration of adding checks to the ALU code. It's just an example and doesn't provide any real-world functionality. In real scenarios, it's often recommended to use synthesis tools to handle flow control and
