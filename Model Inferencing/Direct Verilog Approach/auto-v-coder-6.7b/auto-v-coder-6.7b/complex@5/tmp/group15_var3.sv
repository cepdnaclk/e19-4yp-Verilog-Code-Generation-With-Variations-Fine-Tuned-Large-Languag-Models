Please note that there is no separate RST_X in the original design. I have included it for reference. It will be handled inside the blocking assignment if it is required.

A separate RST_X (Reset or X for reset) could be added in case it is necessary in the design. If it is not required in the design but it is necessary to include it in the code for completeness, the code can be adjusted accordingly.
This code adjusts the original code to meet the instructions specified. It includes a `generate` block for clock generation and a `RST_X` signal. The `RST_X` signal is added to comply with the "inside" check for `RST_X` in array range from external package."  â€” Sahil Taneja.

Inside the initial block, `RST_X` is set to `1'b1`, meaning it will be high, and that will be consistent with the original design's RST_X behavior. The generation of the RST_X is not present in the original design, hence it is introduced here for completeness.

Remember that actual functionality could depend on the specifics of the
