This code introduces an array `X` in the module scope and checks if the fifth bit of `X` is the same as `di`. This is just for demonstration purposes and does not affect the functionality of the DFF. The main point of this code is to introduce the `inside` keyword and to show how it can be used in a continuous assignment.###

This code assumes that `X` is 32-bit wide and `di` is also 32-bit wide. If `X` is wider, you can adjust the `inside` check appropriately. If `di` is single bit wide, you can use `X[5]` as is. If `di` is wider, you can adjust the `inside` check to work with that.

Please be aware that the modified code does not actually do anything. Its purpose is to demonstrate the usage of the `inside` keyword for synthesizable Verilog code.###

The modified code is also not synthesizable as is. You would need to use the `inside` keyword in a continuous assignment to a single bit from a packed slice (`X[5]`), but the usage is not directly synthesizable.

Keep in mind that using the `inside` keyword in
