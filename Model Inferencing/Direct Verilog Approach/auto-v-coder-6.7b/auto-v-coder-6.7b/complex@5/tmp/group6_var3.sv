```verilog

input w0, w1, w2, w3;
input [1:0] S;
output reg f;
parameter sel = {2'b00, 2'b01, 2'b10, 2'b11};
 
always @(w0 or w1 or w2 or w3 or S) begin
    for (byte i = 0; i < 4; i = i + 1) begin
        if (S == sel[i]) begin
            f = i? w1 : w0;
            f = i? w2 : w1;
            f = i? w3 : w2;
            f = i? w0 : w3;

In this variant, the `sel` array contains the possible values for the multiplexer selector `S`. The `for` loop checks each element of the `sel` array against the multiplexer selector `S`, and when a match is found, the output `f` is assigned the corresponding input value. If no match is found after the loop, the output remains unassigned. 

Note: This code assumes that the size of the `sel` array is 4, the same as the number of inputs (`4'b00`, `4'b01`, `4'b10`, `4'b11`). If the number of inputs changes, then the size of the `sel` array must also change, and the code will not function correctly. Similarly, if the number of inputs increases, more elements should be added to the `sel` array.

The `break` statement is used to exit the loop as soon as a match is found, which can improve the performance of the code in cases where we know that only one output will be affected. If we are not sure about this, we can remove the `break` statement.

This code is more readable and maintainable, but it may not be as efficient as the original code. The original code uses hardware-based logic to select the correct output directly, whereas this code uses a loop to handle the multiplexer selector,
