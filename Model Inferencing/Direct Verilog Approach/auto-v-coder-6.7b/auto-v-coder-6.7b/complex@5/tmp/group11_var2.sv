In this modified code, a generate block that iterates over `s` is added. `inside` keyword is used to connect these generated values with the `s` from the MUX. The testbench is modified to monitor and stop after 48 time units.

Please replace `ttrimux2_1` with the actual name of your MUX module. Also, ensure that your MUX takes `s` as an additional parameter. 

This code snippet will dynamically change the value of `s` within the range of 0 to 1 each time. It will monitor the output of your MUX for each combination of input `i` and `s`. It will stop the simulation after 48 time units.
