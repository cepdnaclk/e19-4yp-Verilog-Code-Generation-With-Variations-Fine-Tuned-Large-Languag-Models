```verilog

	end
endgenerate
initial
begin
clk=0; N=4'b1111; // Set limit to 15
En=1'b0; // Start disabled

endmodule
```
This code will create 5 instances of `ctr_wt` with different module instances named `c1` to `c5`. Please note that the numbers after `#` in ctr_wt are placeholders for the index. `inside` operator is used for range selection. The `#` symbol is used for indexing in Verilog. In this case, the module instance name would be `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, `c5`. 

Please, replace `ctr_wt` with your actual module name.### Variation Explanation:

This variation is a common way to create multiple instances of the same module with different input ports and output ports. It uses a generate block, which allows for dynamic generation of instances of a module with varying parameters. 

In this case, the input and output ports are named `a[i]` and `N` respectively. The `#` operator is used to index the array, and `inside` is used to specify the range of indices. This allows for the creation of multiple instances of the module with different input and output ports.

The syntax `ctr_wt #(i)` is used to specify the parameter of the module. In this case, the parameter is the index `i`, which is used to set the initial value of the counter. This is a common way to create multiple instances of the same module with different parameters.
