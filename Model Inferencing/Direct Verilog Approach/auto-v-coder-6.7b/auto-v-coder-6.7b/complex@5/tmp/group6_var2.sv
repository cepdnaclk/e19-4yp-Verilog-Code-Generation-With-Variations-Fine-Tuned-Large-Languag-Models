```Verilog
module mux4to1(w0, w1, w2, w3, S, f);
input w0, w1, w2, w3;
input [1:0] S;
output f;
reg f;
reg [1:0] select_values [3:0];
assign select_values[0] = 2'b00;
assign select_values[1] = 2'b01;
assign select_values[2] = 2'b10;
assign select_values[3] = 2'b11;
always @(w0 or w1 or w2 or w3 or S)
    begin
        for(int i = 0; i < 4; i++) begin
            if (S == select_values[i]) begin
                f = w[i];
                break;
            end
        end
    end
endmodule
```
This new code modifies the mux to use an array of constant-packed vectors to match the value of `S`. When `S` equals any of the elements in the array, the appropriate `w` signal is assigned to `f`. It does this using a `for` loop to iterate over the array and `if` statement to compare `S` with the current element in the array. A `break` statement is used to exit the loop once `f` has been assigned. If `S` doesn't match any of the elements in the array, the `f` will be assigned a default value (not required, but a good practice to include).

Note: The `S` input is an unsigned integer, and the `select_values` are also unsigned integers. If `S` is a signed integer, you may need to adjust the code accordingly.### End of Solution### End
This code should perform the same as the original, but it allows for easy modification if you need to add or delete the mux inputs. It also makes the code more readable and maintainable. It also allows for future extensions by adding or deleting mux inputs by simply editing this line:

```Verilog
assign select_values[index] = S_value;
```
where index is the array index for the new mux input and S_value is the selector value for it.
