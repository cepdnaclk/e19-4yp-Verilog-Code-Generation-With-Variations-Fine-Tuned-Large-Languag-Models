```verilog
`timescale 1ns / 1ns
`define HEX_SEG_CODE {1'b1, 1'b0, 1'b0, 1'b1, 1'b1, 1'b0, 1'b1, 1'b0, 1'b0, 1'b1}

module decoder (out, in);
output reg [9:0] out;
input [3:0] in;

always @ (in) begin
  case (in) inside
    [0:9]: out = `HEX_SEG_CODE; // If input value is between 0 to 9
    default: out = 10'bxxxx_xxxx_xxx; // If input value is anything else
  endcase
end
endmodule
```
In the above code, a `decoder` module is defined that decodes four-bit binary numbers to seven-segment display format. The `x` in `1'b1, 1'b0, 1'b0, 1'b1, 1'b1, 1'b0, 1'b1, 1'b0, 1'b0, 1'b1` corresponds to don't care bits in 10-bit outputs. 

The constant `$HEX_SEG_CODE` is used to represent the seven-segment display for numbers 0 - 9. It is declared with `$` prepended to the identifier, which makes it available to the whole Verilog design (like a global variable). 

The `inside` keyword is used to match the value of `in` against a range of values (e.g., `[0:9]`), which is a compact way to do the following:
```verilog
if(in >= 0 && in <= 9) 
	out = `HEX_SEG_CODE;
else	 
	out = 10'bxxxx_xxxx_xxx;
```
The `decoder` module has a four-bit input `in` and a ten-bit output `out`. After running the module, `out` is assigned to the seven-segment code for each input `in`.
