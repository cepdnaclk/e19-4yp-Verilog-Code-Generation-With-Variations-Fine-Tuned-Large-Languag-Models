This code performs the above operations, but there's an additional case for 8. It checks each bit of A and if it's set, the corresponding bit of F is set to 1, else 0. This is done for each bit in the constant range array. If A isn't within the constant range array, it defaults to its normal operation. Note that the constant_range array is set to {1, 2, 4, 8, 16} as per the example provided in your code. You could change this to fit your specific requirements or use other values. This modification adheres to the requested behavior specified in the task.

Please remember to ensure the inputs and outputs are of the correct width to avoid any possible unwanted assignments or errors. In this case, s, A, B are 3-bit inputs and F is a 4-bit output.

Also, ensure all inputs and outputs are driven from within their respective always blocks. The always block doesn't have a clock signal and will only be evaluated by the change in the inputs.

Lastly, test this code thoroughly to ensure
