This modified code does the following:

- Adds reset and enable signals to test the Johnson counter.
- Adds an initial block to set reset and enable to 1, then 0 in a timed manner after time 10ns.
- Enables the Johnson counter to start counting.
- Adding a reset signal enables resetting the counter to any state.
- The initial block is a common practice to initialize reset and enable at the start of simulation.
This way, we can fully test the Johnson counter module in simulation. 

Remember that this is an introduction to Verilog and might need to be adjusted according to your specific requirements. For instance, you might need to adjust the reset and enable delays to get your specific simulation timing and requirements. Also, note that this modified version assumes the original Johnson counter is a standard counter. If you have a specific version of Johnson's counter that you want to test, you should
