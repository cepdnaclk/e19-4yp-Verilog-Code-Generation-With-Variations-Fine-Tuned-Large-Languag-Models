  always @(posedge Clock, negedge Resetn)

      else y <= Y;
    end
  always @(w or y)
    begin
      if (y == A)
        begin
          z = (w == 1)? 0 : 0;
          Y = (w == 1)? B : A;
        end
      else if (y == B)
        begin
          z = (w == 1)? 1 : 0;

In the above modified code, the `always` block is used to capture the state transition. The `if condition` is used to check whether the `Resetn` signal is low (active low) and reset the `y` state to `A`. Otherwise, the `y` state is updated based on the input `w` and the current `y` state. 

In this modified code, `case` statement has been replaced with `if condition` to optimize state transitions for readability and maintainability. In addition, the `if condition` with array slicing for `w` is used to set the output `z` based on the current `y` state and the input `w`. The `Y` state is also set based on the input `w` and the current `y` state.

This modified code is similar to the original but the state transition is handled with a more compact and readable form. This code follows the principles of Verilog HDL design and can be used as a starting point for designing complex finite state machines.

Note: This code may not run in hardware without further implementation details and constraints. It's a simple example of FSM design and can be scaled and optimized based on specific requirements. In real-world scenarios, the design should follow the best practices and techniques for Verilog HDL design. 

The code provided here is still a simple example of how to design an F
