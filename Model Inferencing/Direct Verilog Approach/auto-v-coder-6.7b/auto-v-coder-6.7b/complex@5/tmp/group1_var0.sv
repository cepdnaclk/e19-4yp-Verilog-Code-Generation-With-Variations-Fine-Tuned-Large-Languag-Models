```verilog
module tst_nor3NMOS();
  reg in1,in2,in3; wire b;
  nor3NMOS nn(in1,in2,in3,b); // Instantiate NMOS NOR
  initial begin // Initialize inputs
    in1=1'b0; in2=1'b0; in3=1'b0; 
  end
  // Toggle inputs at different rates
  always #2 in1=~in1;
  always #3 in2=~in2;
  always #5 in3=~in3;
  initial $monitor($time, "in1 = %b, in2 = %b, in3 = %b, output = %b ",in1,in2,in3,b); 
  initial #24 $stop; 
endmodule

module nor3NMOS(
  input  in1,
  input  in2,
  input  in3,
  output b
);

// Define the behavioral NOR gate
genvar i;
generate
for(i = 0; i < N; i = i + 1) begin: gen_block1
  nor(b[i], in1[i], in2[i], in3[i]);
end
endgenerate

endmodule
```
In the modified code, `genvar i;` inside the `generate` block is used as iterator. After that, we generated the behavioral NOR gate using the `for` loop. This generates a 3-input NOR gate using the behavioral code that connects directly with the `nor` gate. 

Note: Please make sure to replace `N` with the number of inputs you want in the `nor` gate, as `N` is used as the number of inputs in the `generate` block. If you change the number of inputs, you should also change the `N` value in the `generate` loop.

Please note that this is a very simplified example to demonstrate the concept, and proper Verilog code should not be written this way. More efficient and correct code would be written with individual NOR gates connected in series and potentially also utilizing `mux` or `decode` circuits for multiple inputs. This is a
