This code defines a SystemVerilog class for a finite state machine with two states, A and B. The class has a step function to move from one state to the next based on the input `w`. The `MealyFSM` class is used in the top-level module to create an instance of the FSM and to update the output `z` based on the input `w`. When the `Resetn` input is `0`, the FSM resets, and when `Resetn` is `1`, it processes the `w` input. ### Note: This modified code is a simplified version of the original problem. The original problem was not specified exactly what the FSM should do when transitioning from state A to state B, or vice versa. This modification assumes the FSM is a Mealy machine, where the output can depend on both the state and the input. The `fsm` parameter array is defined with two rows representing the state A and B, and two columns representing the input 0 and 1. Each of the four elements of the array represents the output from one state when fed with one input. When `Resetn` is 0, the state of the FSM is reset to state A. When `
