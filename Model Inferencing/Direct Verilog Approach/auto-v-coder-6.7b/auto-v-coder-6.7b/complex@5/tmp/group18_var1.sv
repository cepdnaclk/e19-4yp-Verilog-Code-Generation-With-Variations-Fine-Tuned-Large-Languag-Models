In this code, `X` and `Y` are declared in the module's scope and used inside the `always` block. This demonstrates the usage of the `inside` operator for checking if a result lies in a packed slice. The `inside_result` output is set based on the result of the `inside` operation.

Note: The `inside` operation is part of SystemVerilog, not Verilog-2001, so this code only runs under SystemVerilog simulation. The `inside_result` output is not used in Verilog-2001 simulation and can be omitted.

Also note that the `inside` operator checks if all elements of the right-hand side set (`Y` in this case) are a part of the left-hand side set (`X` in this case) and not the other
