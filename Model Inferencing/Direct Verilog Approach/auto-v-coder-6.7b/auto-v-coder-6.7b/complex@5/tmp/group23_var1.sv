In this modification, a constant array `REG_INSIDE` is used to hold the constant values required for the specific instruction. This constant array is checked by the `generate` block to determine if a shift register named 'inside' already exists. If it does, then an error message is printed, which indicates that a shift register named 'inside' already exists.

This check is performed at compile-time, giving you a compile-time error if the shift register named 'inside' already exists. Note that this is a simple check and it does not cover all possible scenarios or edge cases. However, it is a good starting point to ensure that the instantiation of your shift register does not conflict with the naming of any existing registers. 

Modify this as per your specific requirements and usage scenario.
