```Verilog
module comp
(input wire [N-1:0] x,
input wire [N-1:0] y,
output reg gt, // Greater than
output reg eq, // Equal
output reg lt // Less than
);
always @(*) // Combinational logic
begin
// Default outputs to 0
gt = 1'b0;
eq = 1'b0;
lt = 1'b0;
// Set flags based on comparison results
if(x > y)
gt = 1'b1;
if(x == y)
eq = 1'b1;
if(x < y)
lt = 1'b1;
end
endmodule
```
The original code was already implemented correctly as a combinational Verilog module. However, the modified code is also a combinational module and behaves the same as the original one. This means that when the inputs `x` and `y` are changed, the outputs `gt`, `eq`, and `lt` represent the comparison of `x` and `y`. 

This is a common way of writing a combinational module in Verilog for simple conditional checks and assignments. It is not necessary to use a `generate` construct or a function call result in the array index within the `inside` operator here. The conditional `if` statements are used for the same purpose of setting the flags. The use of `always @(*)` ensures that the output assignments are executed whenever the inputs change. 

Note that this code assumes that `N` is a parameter and is known at the time of synthesis, meaning it must be defined in the module declaration. If `N` is not known at time of synthesis, then, to work with arrays, you would typically use a parameter that could be adjusted, such as a parameter `N` = 1024.

The code itself is simple and does not require any modifications to function as intended. However, in a more complex design, you might use different types of `always` blocks (like `always @(posedge clk)` for sequential logic) based on the design requirements and simulation/synthesis flow. 

Remember to keep in mind that combinational logic does not guarantee any timing constraints as there are no clock signals in this case. In designs with real clocked
