```### Explanation:
In this modified code, we've added an assertion to the code. The assertion compares the value of `data` with the content of the `const_array1` against the `const_array2`. The assertion will fail if the value of `data` does not exist in `const_array2`. The verification is done at the falling edge of the `x` signal. If the assertion fails, the error message will be printed. The `posedge` edge sensitivity ensures that the assertions are checked at the falling edge of the `x` signal. This is done to ensure the assertions are not violated at any time during the simulation. 

Please make sure to understand the difference between `inside` and `==` in SystemVerilog. While `==` can be used to compare any two expressions, `inside` is specifically used to check if an expression is in a given set of values.

Note: The mixed_sim module will be loaded and it is expected that the `
