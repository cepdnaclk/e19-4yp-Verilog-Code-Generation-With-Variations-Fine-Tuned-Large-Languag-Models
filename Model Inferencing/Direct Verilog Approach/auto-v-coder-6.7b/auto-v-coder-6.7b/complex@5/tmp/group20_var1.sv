This code still does the same thing as your original code: it sets up a mixed simulation which monitors its state every time its control signal changes. It also checks whether the assigned bus value matches the constant value in the `constant_value` array declared in the `mixed_sim_pkg` package. If they match, it displays a message, otherwise, it displays a different message. The `inside` keyword is used to check if a value is inside an array. This variation of the code checks if the bus value is within the `constant_value` slice. If it is, it will display a message saying 'Matched constant value bus =', otherwise it displays a message saying 'Did not match bus ='. The `inside` keyword is used to check if a value is inside an array. This variation of the code checks if the bus value is within the `constant_value` slice.
