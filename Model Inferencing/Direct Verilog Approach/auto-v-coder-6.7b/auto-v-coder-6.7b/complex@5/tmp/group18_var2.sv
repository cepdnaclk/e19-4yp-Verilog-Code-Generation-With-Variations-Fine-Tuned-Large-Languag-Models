Note: This code is meant for simulation purposes only. In real-world applications, the packed slice check `inside` would not be used because the compiler would remove it. This is a simulation feature and it does not exist in hardware simulation. Also, make sure to use this code within a block of code where `X` and `Y` are declared.

In the original code, `qb=~q` is not used, it could be removed if you don't need its functionality in your application.

Also, for proper testbench use, make sure the values of `X`,
