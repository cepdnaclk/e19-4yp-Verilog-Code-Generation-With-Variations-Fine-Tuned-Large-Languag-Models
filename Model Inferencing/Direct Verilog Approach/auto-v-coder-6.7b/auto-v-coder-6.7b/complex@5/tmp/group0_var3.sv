end
initial $monitor("t=%0d, en = %b, index = %d, a = %h, b = %h",$time,en,index,a[index],b[index]); // Use %h for hex 'a' and 'b'

In the new code, an array of 4-bit register is used to test the array slice feature. This also includes an index input for the or_gate module, which can be used to select the element of the array to be tested. This indexing method is very useful for simulating different scenarios or test cases. The `initial $monitor` statement has been modified to print the 2nd element of `a` array and its corresponding output `b`. The `inside begin` block is also used for different signals. The `#30` delay is added after the initialization block to simulate a delay for observation before simulation end.

Please note that this code assumes the `or_gate` module's outputs have the same size as its inputs, which is generally true if you're using arrays or slices of arrays as inputs for a module. If you're using single wires or registers, you may need to use the `$monitor` statement differently.

Also, please replace the `or_gate` with your actual module name. And make sure that `or_gate` is defined with 'SIZE' as its parameter.

Note: The `or_gate` module will be responsible for
