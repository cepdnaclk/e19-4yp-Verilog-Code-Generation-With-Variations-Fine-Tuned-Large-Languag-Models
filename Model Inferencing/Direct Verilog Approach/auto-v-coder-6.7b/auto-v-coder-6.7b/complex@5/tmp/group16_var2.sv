In this code, the `get_comparators` function returns a 'logic [3:0]' array. A comparator logic in the `TOP1` module compares input `x` against this array and prints a message whether the comparison matched or not. 

Please note that the use of `import` statement is necessary when referencing functions from package into a module. Also, the input `x` should be connected to an appropriate logic, either generated via a testbench or from a port of a higher-level module. This code is suitable for simulation purposes using modelsim or other simulators. ### Importance of this change:
The `inside` operator is a relatively new feature in SystemVerilog and it provides a concise way to check if a value is inside a list. This feature is useful in many scenarios, especially when dealing with arrays or collections. In this modified code, the `inside` operator is used to compare the input `x` with a fixed set of comparators defined in a package. This can be useful in verifying certain patterns or configurations, like certain values of `x`, in the design. 

When verifying the functionality of the design, the use of `inside` operator ensures that the design behaves as intended by checking if the input `x` is one of a fixed set of values. This is particularly useful for validation or verification scenarios where fixed comparator values
