```verilog
module mixed_sim;
reg dcontrol, x, y;
reg [31:0] data;
wire [31:0] bus;
assign bus = dcontrol? data : 'bz;
always @(x)
y = ~x;
initial
begin
$monitor("time=%d dcontrol=%d data=%d x=%d y=%d bus=%d",
         $time, dcontrol, data, x, y, bus);
dcontrol = 0;
end
endmodule
```
In the code above, `always @(x)` is used to create a combinational logic block which performs an operation based on the value of `x` when the value of `x` changes. `y = ~x` is a simple NOT operation that inverts the value of `x` and assigns it to `y`. 

`initial` is used to create a block of code that is evaluated sequentially at the beginning of the simulation. `$monitor` is a system function that is used to print a message to the standard output. In this case, it prints the current time, the value of `dcontrol`, the value of `data`, the value of `x`, the value of `y`, and the value of `bus`. 

Finally, `dcontrol = 0;` is used to set the initial value of `dcontrol` to zero. This value is not relevant for the current simulation, as the `dcontrol` variable is not used within the code snippet you provided. If `dcontrol` was actually used in the code, this would need to be initialized according to the specific logic driving the circuit.### Note:
This is a standard Verilog code snippet with no need for modification as the functionality described is already implemented in the code snippet. However, the code was provided for clarity and might be used as a basic template for a more complex Verilog simulation.### Disclaimer: This code snippet is a simplified simulation model and would not actually run as such. The purpose of providing this code snippet is to explain the underlying concept and the use of certain Verilog constructs. The actual Verilog code would need to be adapted to a more complex circuit and context to work as intended.###
