```verilog
module tst_ctr_wt;
reg clk,En;
reg[3:0]N;
wire[3:0]a;
ctr_wt c1(a,clk,N,En);
initial
begin
clk=0; N=4'b1111; // Set limit to 15
En=1'b0; // Start disabled
end
always
initial #35 $stop; // Stop simulation
always #2 clk = ~clk; // Toggle clock
always @(posedge clk) begin // At posedge of clock
   N = N + 1;
   if (N == 5'b11111) N = 5'b00000;
end
always @(a) begin // Change En based on a value
   En = (a == 4'b0000)? 1'b1 : 1'b0;
end
initial $monitor($time,"clk=%b, En=%b, N=%d, a=%d",clk,En,N,a); // Corrected format specifiers
endmodule
```

This changes the counter limit up to 31 and toggles the En signal based on the counter value reaching 4'b0000. For each clock cycle, the counter is incremented, and if it reaches 31, it resets to 0. Please note that this is a primitive way to simulate a counter that overflows to 0.

Also, it is important to note that using always blocks without a sensitivity list (i.e., @(*) {...}) can create a combinational loop and may cause the simulator to hang. In this code, only the clock is used as a sensitivity. The rest of the changes are sequential. Thus, it's okay to use always blocks with a sensitivity list. 

This code also monitors the values at each time step. The outputs are clk, En, and N. However, the value of a has not been added to the monitor because a is an output of a module and is not driven by the simulation. If you want to monitor the output, connect it to a net and monitor that.
