```verilog
// Define the package
package state_pkg;
    parameter [7:0] state_Mealy[] = {8'b00000001, 8'b00000010, 8'b00000100, 8'b00001000, 8'b00010000, 8'b00100000, 8'b01000000, 8'b10000000};
endpackage

// Using the package in the module
module mixed_sim;
    import state_pkg::state_Mealy;
    reg [7:0] my_state;
    initial
    begin
        if (my_state inside {state_Mealy})
            $display("My state is a member of the predefined state array.");
        else
            $display("My state is not a member of the predefined state array.");
    end
endmodule
```
In this modified code, we've defined a package called `state_pkg` that declares a `state_Mealy` array. In the `mixed_sim` module, we've imported this package and a `my_state` is compared against `state_Mealy`. The result of this comparison is printed to the console. If `my_state` is inside `state_Mealy`, the message "My state is a member of the predefined state array." is printed. Otherwise, the message "My state is not a member of the predefined state array." is printed. This demonstrates how to use package constants in a verilog module.
