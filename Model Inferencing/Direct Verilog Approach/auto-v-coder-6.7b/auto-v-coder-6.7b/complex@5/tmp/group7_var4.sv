In this code, we have added an if-else statement in the second and third cases which checks if any operand lies within 0-3 range. If it does, it will return a constant result. However, if the operand does not lie in the range, the usual subtraction or addition takes place.
This modification helps to perform arithmetic operations in a safe manner. It prevents any unwanted overflows or underflows in the subtraction or addition operations. Also, it prevents any unintentional data loss or changes in the
