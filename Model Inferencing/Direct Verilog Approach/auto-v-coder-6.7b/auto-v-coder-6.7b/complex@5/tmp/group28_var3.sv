In the code above, we've included the package which defines the range of states that are valid. Then, we check if `state` is inside these valid ranges. If `state` is outside this range, we replace `flush_P0_P1` with `inside` check against the valid range.

Please note, you need to replace `flush_P0_P1` and `state` with your specific variable and module names. Also, you need to include the package file that contains the range definitions.

This is a basic guideline and may need modifications depending on your specific case. Please adapt it to your needs.```verilog
