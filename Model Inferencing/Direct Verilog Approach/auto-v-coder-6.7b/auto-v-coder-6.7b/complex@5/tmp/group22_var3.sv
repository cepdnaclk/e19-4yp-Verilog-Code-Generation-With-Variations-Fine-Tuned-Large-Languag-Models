The modified code firstly declares the inputs and outputs of the D latch, then instantiates the D latch with `di` and `en` connected to the input and `do` to the output. The enable signal is toggled every 7 time units, while the data signal is toggled every 4 time units. The output of the D latch is monitored by the `$monitor` statement. The simulation continues until it has passed 50 time units.  The D latch is embedded in a separate module and the `dffen` module receives the data and enable signal from the instantiated module. The D latch is controlled by the enable signal and the data input. If the enable signal is high, the output of the D latch is set to the data input. Otherwise, the output remains at its previous value. The combinational code for the D latch is wrapped inside the escaped generate block of the module. This ensures that the combinational logic is synthesized correctly and is evaluated when the enable signal is high.
