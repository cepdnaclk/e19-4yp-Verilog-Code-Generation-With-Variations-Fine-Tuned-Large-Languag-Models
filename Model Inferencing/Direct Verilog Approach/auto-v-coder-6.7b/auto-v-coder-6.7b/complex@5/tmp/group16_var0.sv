```
In this code, we have defined a package `constants` with a constant array of 4 elements. Inside the `TOP1` module, we use the `inside` operator to compare `x` against `const`. The `ready` output is set to `1` if `x` is inside `const`, and `0` otherwise. The comparison is made on every posedge of `CLK` or `RST_X`.### This modified code can be used for testing comparator logic that uses `inside` operator to compare against a constant array defined in a package.
### Note: 
The package `constants` is required for simulation, and this file `tb_TOP1.sv` should be included in `verilog_files` list in the `.yosys` file where simulation is done. Also, make sure you have the `-y osip_test/src/sv/` parameter in yosys command line to include this package file.
