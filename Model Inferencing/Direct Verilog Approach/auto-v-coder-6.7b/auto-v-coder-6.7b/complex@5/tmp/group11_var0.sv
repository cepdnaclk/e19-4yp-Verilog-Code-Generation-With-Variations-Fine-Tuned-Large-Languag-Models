In this modified code, we create a generate loop for `s` from 0 to 1. For each iteration of the loop, an instance of `ttrimux2_1` is created with different values of `s`. The output for each instance is then monitored during simulation. #48 is the delay for simulation to run. The `$stop` command is used to stop simulation after the specified delay. 

Please replace `ttrimux2_1` with your actual multiplexer's name. This will allow you to test your tristate multiplexer with different `s` values to ensure correctness of the design.joy
