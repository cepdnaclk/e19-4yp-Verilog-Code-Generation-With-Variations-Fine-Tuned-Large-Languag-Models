```verilog
module tb_TOP1;
  reg CLK, RST_X;
  TOP1 uut(.CLK(CLK),.RST_X(RST_X));

  initial begin
    CLK = 0;
    forever #5 CLK = ~CLK;
  end

  initial begin
    RST_X = 0; #10;
    RST_X = 1;
  end
endmodule
```
In this example, I have assumed that `TOP1` is the module you want to test and `inside` operator is used to compare `x` with a constant array. The `inside` operator is not supported in Verilog. You might need to use `$in` function from systemVerilog or `inside` operator in some HDL. The same can be applied to a different programming language like C++, Python, etc., depending on your requirement. 

We generally use libraries like `SystemVerilog` for handling these kinds of functions. If you are using `Verilog`, then you need to use system tasks/functions. 

Remember to replace `inside` operator with appropriate systemVerilog/HDL syntax. It will vary based on the HDL you are using. So, always double-check for the syntax/library that is being used.

If you want to use `$in` function, then you must be using SystemVerilog. This function is available in SystemVerilog libraries. See example:

```verilog
// Assuming constant array exists in a package file named "pkg.sv".
module top (
  input wire [31:0] x
);
  import "DPI-C" function int x_in_pkg(input [31:0] x);
  always @(*) begin
    if (x_in_pkg(x)) begin
      // Do something
    end
  end
endmodule
```

In this example, the `$in` function is used to test if `x` is inside the array defined in a package. Please customize as per your requirements.

Keep in mind that the example given here is an idea of what your code could look like, you may need to modify it to fit your needs. ###
