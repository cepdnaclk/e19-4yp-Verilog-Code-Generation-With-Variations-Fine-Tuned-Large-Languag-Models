```
In the `Apply_Data` block, we replace the constant assignment of `mem1[indx]` and `mem2[indx]` with the `assign` statement, which now assigns the values using `generate` loop. The `generate` statement in Verilog is a tool for generating Verilog code. 

This modified version of the code will apply `mem1[indx]` and `mem2[indx]` to the data bus, where `indx` is the loop index. The delays are adjusted to make sure the data is properly transferred to the data bus before the clock edge.

This modified version also removes the original placeholders for `Apply_Start` and `Expected_Result` as they were not part of the original code provided. They will be replaced with their specific functionality as needed.

Note: These modifications are based on the original context and will be adjusted based on the specific needs of the testbench. In a real-world scenario, you might need to adjust the timing parameters and other details based on your specific hardware and test environment. 

Please remember to replace the original code with the modified code in your testbench.

This modification should provide a more comprehensive test covering the entire array of mem1 and mem2, rather than
