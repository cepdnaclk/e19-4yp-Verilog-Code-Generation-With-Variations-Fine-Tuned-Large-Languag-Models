In this code, I've replaced the `initial` block with `generate` and `inside` statement in `always` block to create testbench for tristate 2-to-1 multiplexer. 

The `generate` block creates multiple instances of the code inside it for each value of the variable specified in the `s`. 

The `inside` operator is used to specify the instance of the `generate` block to execute. In this case, it's creating an instance for each value of `s`.

You would need to replace `initial` with `generate` and add `inside` operator to create multiple instances and testcases for different values of `s`.

Note: Be sure that the tristate multiplexer (`ttrimux2_1`) is implemented correctly, as the modified code doesn't contain the actual implementation of the tristate multiplexer. This is just a testbench for its functionality.

In Verilog, there is no direct support for tristate multiplexers. You would need to implement them using `tri0` and `tri1` strengths. For a detailed implementation, please refer to the actual tristate multiplexer design from your source.

It is recommended to use `tri0` strength (unused pins driven to high impedance) for `
