Here is the modified code:

```verilog
module encoder (BCD_in, Excess_3_out);
input [3:0] BCD_in;
output [3:0] Excess_3_out;

reg [3:0] HiCount [0:256];
genvar i;
generate
    for(i=0; i<=256; i++) begin
        if ({4'b0,i} > 3) begin
            assign HiCount[i] = {4'b0,i} - 3;
        end
        else begin
            assign HiCount[i] = {4'b0,i};
        end
    end
endgenerate

//encoder M0(BCD_in, Excess_3_out);
assign Excess_3_out = HiCount[BCD_in];
endmodule

module t_encoder();
reg [3:0] BCD_in;
wire [3:0] Excess_3_out;
encoder M0(BCD_in, Excess_3_out);
initial
$monitor($time,,"BCD = %b, Excess-3 Code = %b", BCD_in, Excess_3_out);

initial begin
end
initial begin //Simulation Test Pattern
end
endmodule
```

In this modified code, an array `HiCount[]` is created which holds the value after adding 3 to the index. Then, using the `generate` block, a loop is created to generate the values from `0` to `256`. In this loop, a condition is checked whether the index is greater than `3`. If it is, then the value is `index-3` else, it is `index`. 

After that, a `generate` block is used to instantiate the `encoder` module and connect the outputs. Then, the `Excess_3_out` output is assigned by using the index from `BCD_in` as the index within the `HiCount[]` array.

This approach provides a way to have a lookup table for the BCD values by adding 3, reducing the logic in the encoder module. The lookup table makes
