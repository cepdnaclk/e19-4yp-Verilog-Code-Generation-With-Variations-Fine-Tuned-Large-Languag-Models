This modified code is intended to solve the problem and increase the correctness of the Johnson counter by using a static array within the generate block.

Please note that the static array values are set in such a way that for each valid value of `count`, the counter will move to the next valid value in sequence. It helps to avoid the possibility of an undefined state for the Johnson counter when `enable` is 0.

Please note that you will need to modify the value assignment in the static array to match your specific application needs. For instance, if your Johnson counter is working with 4 bits to count from 0 to 15 in this case, the static array should be assigned as follows:
```
reg [3: 0]
