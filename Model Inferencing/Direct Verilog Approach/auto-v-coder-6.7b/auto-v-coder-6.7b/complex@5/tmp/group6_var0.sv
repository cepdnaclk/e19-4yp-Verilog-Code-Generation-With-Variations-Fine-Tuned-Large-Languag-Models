```verilog
module mux4to1(w0, w1, w2, w3, S, f);
input w0, w1, w2, w3;
input [1:0] S;
output f;
reg f;
localparam logic [1:0] selects [3:0] = '{2'b00, 2'b01, 2'b10, 2'b11};
always @(w0 or w1 or w2 or w3 or S)
    foreach (selects[i])
        if (S == selects[i])
            f = {w0, w1, w2, w3}[i];
endmodule
```
In the above modified code, we defined a local constant array called `selects` which holds the target values of select codes. Then we used a `foreach` loop to compare each select value with `S`. If `S` equals to one of the select values, the corresponding data bits are assigned to `f`. 

This code also avoids the use of multiple if-else branches. This is generally the preferred method when we have to check multiple conditions and execute different actions. It is more efficient and easier to read and write.

Remember, this code uses Verilog 2001 syntax. For Verilog 1995, you might need a slightly different approach. The code above is compatible with both standard Verilog and the SystemVerilog language. 

Also, please note that the positioning of the selected bits in the concatenation {w0, w1, w2, w3} is important. It was done so as to maintain the order for the selection of bits as per the select codes.

Remember to understand usage before implementing. This is an example of using Verilog for a specific problem instead of a general purpose multi-purpose solution. The usage of this kind of construct might be seen as redundant, but it's a possible way to write such a Verilog module.

The code above might be used with the assumption that all inputs are valid (i.e., they are not unknown or X). It is always good practice to verify the input values before using the module.

Lastly, notice that any synthesizable code must satisfy timing constraints.
