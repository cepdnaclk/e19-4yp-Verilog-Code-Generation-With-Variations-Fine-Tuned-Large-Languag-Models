```verilog
module addern(carryin, X, Y, S, carryout, data);
parameter n = 16;
input carryin;
input [n-1:0] X, Y;
output [n-1:0] S;
output carryout;
wire [n-1:0] data;
reg [n-1:0] S;
reg [n:0] C;
reg carryout;
integer k;
always @(X or Y or carryin)
begin
    C[0] = carryin;
    for (k = 0; k <= n-1; k = k + 1)
    begin
        S[k] = X[k] ^ Y[k] ^ C[k];
        C[k+1] = (X[k] & Y[k]) | (C[k] & X[k]) | (C[k] & Y[k]);
    end
    carryout = C[n];
    data = S;  // Access data from the interface scope
end
endmodule
```
In the modified code, an array `data` is defined in the module's interface scope. After the adder operation, the results `S` are assigned to `data`, making it accessible to any sub-module or testbench that uses the top-level module as an interface. This is a common practice in Verilog programming for interfacing with data.

Please note that this changes the `S` wire to a `data` wire, as the Verilog standard specifies that `S` is a reserved keyword and should not be used as a variable. Any Verilog synthesis tool might not be able to synthesize the modified code due to these restrictions. It's good practice to use descriptive names for variables and wires.

Also, note that in the modified code, `carryout` is not used in the `data` assignment. If the carryout is also needed, you can concatenate `data` and `carryout` in the `data` assignment. However, this is not strictly necessary since `carryout` is a separate output in the module's top level interface. 

This variation is primarily useful if the verilog code is intended to be used in combination with a system that needs to extract
