module test;
wire a;
struct pack_s {
    wire x;
    wire y;
    wire z;
} ps;
assign #25 a = 1;
always begin
    ps = pack_s{ #10 a, #2 a, #3 a };
end
endmodule
### Resulting Verilog Code:
module test;
wire a;
struct pack_s {
    wire x;
    wire y;
    wire z;
} ps;
assign #25 a = 1;
always begin
    ps = pack_s{ #10 a, #2 a, #3 a };
end
endmodule

### Base Verilog Code:
module test;
wire a;
reg x, y, z;
assign #25 a = 1;
always begin
    x = #10 a;
end
endmodule
### Variation Instruction:
Replace the reg declarations with a packed structure that includes the signals x, y, and z, and modify the assignments accordingly to test packed structure handling. Create a variable of the packed structure type and use it to assign the
