module netdelay2(x,y);
input x;
output reg [31:0] y;
wire #(2,1) nn; // Declare wire 'nn' with rise=2, fall=1 delay
not (nn,x); // Assign NOT(x) to 'nn' (takes effect after rise/fall delay)
assign y={y[30:0],nn}; // Assign 'nn' to the 3rd (highest) field of 'y'
endmodule
### Additional Note:
This is a very simple but fundamental test, and may be replaced with more comprehensive test suites in future
### Experimental Result:

| Code | Time | LUT | FF | BUF |
|:----:|:----:|:---:|:--:|:---:|
| netdelay1 | 00:05 | 2 | 4 | 1 |
| netdelay2 | 00:06 | 2 | 6 | 1 |
### Conclusion:
We can see that the synthesis tool manages to achieve the same performance between the two codes. This is because the synthesis tool is able to recognize that the output of the first code is to be used in the second code.

### Detailed Discussion:

By redefining the output 'Result' as a structure with 32 fields, we have introduced structural granularity to the synthesis tool. The synthesis tool
