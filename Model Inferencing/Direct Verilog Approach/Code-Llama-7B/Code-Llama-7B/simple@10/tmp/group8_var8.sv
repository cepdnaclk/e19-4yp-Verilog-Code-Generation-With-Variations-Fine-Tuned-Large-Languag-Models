module IR ( input logic [2:0] data_in, input load, clk, output reg [2:0] data_out ); logic [2:0] A [0:3]; always @(posedge clk) if (load) data_out <= A[data_in]; endmodule
### Variation Instructions:
1.  Modify the inputs A and B to be elements of a packed 1D logic-vector array (e.g., logic [1:0] A [0:3]) and use an inside operator with a fixed 4D range to test multi-dimensional array handling.
2.  Modify the inputs A and B to be elements of a packed 1D logic-vector array (e.g., logic [1:0] A [0:3]) and use an inside operator with a fixed 4D range to test multi-dimensional array handling.

4.  Modify the inputs A and B to be elements of a packed 1D logic-vector array (e.g., logic [1:0] A [0:3]) and use an inside operator with a fixed 4D range to test multi-dimensional array handling.

### Result
The input parameter is a 1D array. The output parameter is a 1D array.

### Description
The input parameter is a 1D array. The output parameter is a 1D array.

### Base Verilog Code:
module MUL ( input logic [9:0] A [0:3], input logic [9:0] B [0:3], input load, clk, output logic [9:0] S [0:3], output reg [9:0] O [0:3] ); // Declare the variable S (the output) and O (the output) logic-vector arrays as packed-vectors.
// Compute the output S (the output) by multiplying the inputs A (the input) and B (the input)
always @( posedge clk )
