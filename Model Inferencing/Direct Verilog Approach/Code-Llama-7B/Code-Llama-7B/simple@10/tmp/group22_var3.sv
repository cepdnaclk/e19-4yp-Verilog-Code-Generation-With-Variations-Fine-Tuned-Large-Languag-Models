### Design Description

The design uses struct-based modular interconnection to connect the four instances of the `par` module together. The `par` module is instantiated four times in the top-level `struct` module, each time with a new instance name. The struct-based interconnect consists of a crossbar and muxes. The crossbar contains a set of connections to the input lines, one per member of the structure. The muxes that route the output lines to the outputs of the `struct` module.

The `par` module represents the structural interconnection between the four instances.

### Structural Code

```verilog
module par(in, parity, all_ones);
input [7:0] in;
output parity, all_ones;

assign parity = ^in;
assign all_ones = &in;
end
