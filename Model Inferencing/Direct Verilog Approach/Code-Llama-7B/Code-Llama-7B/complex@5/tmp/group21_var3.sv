### Explanation:
In Lecture 5, we saw how to use the `inside` operator to check if a value is in a given range. However, we could not use it on vectors. So in this case, we just used a dollar unit constant:
```
`define DATA_RANGE 3
initial begin
$display("D_in:    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9");
$display("inside 3 to 5:   %b",(inside({3,4,5},6)));
$display("inside 3 to 5:   %b",(inside({3,4,5},1)));
$display("inside 3 to 5:   %b",(inside({3,4,5},0)));
$display("inside 3 to 5:   %b",(inside({3,4,5},9)));
$display("inside 3 to 5:   %b",(inside({3,4,5},2)));
$display("inside 3 to 5:   %b",(inside({3,4,5},3)));
$display("inside 3 to 5:   %b",(inside({3,4,5},4)));
$display("inside 3 to 5:   %b",(inside({3,4,5},5)));
$display("inside 3 to 5:   %b",(inside({3,4,5},6)));
$display("inside 3 to 5:   %b",(inside({3,4,5},7)));
$display("inside 3 to 5:   %b",(inside({3,4,5},8)));
$display("inside 3 to 5:   %b",(inside({3,4,5},9)));
end
```
Then added the variable `n = D_in` so that it can be used in the `inside` block.

### Base Verilog Code:
module Prob_6_8_Mealy (Detect_Mealy, D_in, clk, rst);
// Mealy nonresetting sequence detector
output Detect_Mealy;
input D
