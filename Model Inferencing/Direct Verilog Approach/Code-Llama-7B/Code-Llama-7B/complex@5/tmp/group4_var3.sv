### Result

### Observation
* Both the `a` and `N` signals are being sampled in the second waveform.

### Analyzer:
* Signal `N` is a parameter in the module.
* Signal `a` is an output from the module.
* In the second waveform, Signal `a` is sampled before Signal `N`.
* According to VHDL 1993 standard, "When an escaped name... appears in an expression, it is not evaluated.
* Signal `N` is evaluated to 15 first before the second waveform.
* The escaped name `N` is evaluated as a signal instead of a parameter.
* When we evaluate an expression for the signal `a`, the escaped name `N` is being substituted with the 15-bits signal `N` and the `inside` operator is applied to the expression.
* The result is a non-constant expression and it is evaluated as an unknown value.
* The `a` signal is sampled an unknown value.
* When the `En` signal is enabled during the second waveform, the `a` signal is sampled by the same unknown value.
* According to VHDL 2008 standard, "Parameters are replaced during analysis and elaboration by expressions that evaluate to constants... This replacement is also known as parameter substitution."
* This substitution is performed during the first waveform.
* The escaped name `N` is replaced by the parameter `N` that is evaluated to 15.
* The `inside` operator is applied to the expression.
* This gives the correct result.

### Final Verilog Code:

begin
clk=0; N=15; // Set limit to 15
En=0; // Start disabled
end
always
initial #35 $stop; // Stop simulation
initial $monitor($time,"clk=%b, En=%b, N=%d, a=%d",clk,En,N,a); // Corrected format specifiers
endmodule
