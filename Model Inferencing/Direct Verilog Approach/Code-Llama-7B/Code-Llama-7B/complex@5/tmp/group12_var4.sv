### Expected Results
![Expected Results for this variation](/images/2020-05-18-Verilog-Examples-Variation-5-Expected-Results.png)

### Possible Error Scenarios for this variation
- The first monitor, the only one using the signal clr, shows a wrong value as it is using the output signal clr. It should be using the input signal clr instead. The second monitor has the correct clr value.
- The second monitor, the only one using the signal pr, shows a wrong value as it is using the output signal pr. It should be using the input signal pr instead. The second monitor has the correct pr value.
- The third monitor, the only one using the signal q, shows a wrong value as it is using the output signal qb. It should be using the input signal qb instead. The second monitor has the correct q value.
- The fourth monitor, the only one using the signal di, shows a wrong value as it is using the output signal qb. It should be using the input signal di instead. The second monitor has the correct di value.
- The fifth monitor, the only one using the signal q, shows the correct value.
- The sixth monitor, the only one using the signal qb, shows the correct value.
- The seventh monitor, the only one using the signal pck, shows the correct value.
- The eighth monitor, the only one using the signal pck[1:3], shows the correct value.
- The ninth monitor, the only one using the signal pck[1], shows the correct value.
- The tenth monitor, the only one using the signal pck[2], shows the correct value.
### Assumptions for this variation
- The value of the signal q should equal the value of the signal di.
- The value of the signal qb should equal the value of the signal di.
- The value of the signal q should equal the value of the signal pr.
- The value of the signal qb should equal the value of the signal pr.
- The value of the signal clr should equal 0.
- The value of the signal pr should equal 1.
- The value of the signal di should equal 0.
- The fifth monitor should be the first monitor in the list.
- The sixth monitor should be the second monitor in the list.
- The seventh monitor should be the third monitor in the list.
- The eighth monitor should be the fourth monitor in the list.
- The ninth monitor should be the fifth monitor in the list.
- The tenth monitor should be the sixth monitor in the list.
### Additional Comments
This variation was the most challenging for me. Originally I had the code where I set up the packed array being executed inside an always block. I put the always block in a loop because I didn't know how to
