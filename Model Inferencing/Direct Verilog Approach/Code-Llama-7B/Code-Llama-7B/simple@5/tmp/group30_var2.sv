module netdelay1(x,y);
input x;
output [31:0] y;
wire #(2,1) nn; // Declare wire 'nn' with rise=2, fall=1 delay
not (nn,x); // Assign NOT(x) to 'nn' (takes effect after rise/fall delay)
assign y=nn; // Assign 'nn' to 'y' (direct assignment)
endmodule
### Simulation:
1. Simulate the modification without modifying the verilog module, verify that it successfully builds and simulates. 
2. Add the modified output Result as a packed structure with 32 fields, verify that the module successfully builds and simulates.
3. Add the modified delay line for 'nn', verify that the module successfully builds and simulates.
4. Build the module with the modified delay line, and report the results.


### Discussion:
What is the difference between a unit width and a 32 bit packed structural? Is it possible to have a 32 bit packed structural with a 1 bit delay?
What is the difference between a unit width and a 32 bit vector? Is it possible to have a 32 bit vector with a 1 bit delay?
What is the difference between a unit width and a 32 bit register? Is it possible to have a 32 bit register with a 1 bit
