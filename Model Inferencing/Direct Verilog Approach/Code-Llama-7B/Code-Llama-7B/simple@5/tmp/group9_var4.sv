module Problem8(input [3:0] a, b, output [3:0] diff);
  reg [3:0] x;
  reg [3:0] y;
  reg [3:0] z;
  assign diff = x - y;
  assign x = a;
  assign y = b;
  assign z = x + y;
endmodule
```

### Solution:

We need to define these as `logic` and `logic signed` in the new module and use them as packed structures.

```verilog
module Problem8(input [3:0] a, b, output [3:0] diff);
  logic [3:0] x;
  logic signed [3:0] y;
  logic signed [3:0] z;
  assign diff = x - y;
  assign x = a;
  assign y = b;
