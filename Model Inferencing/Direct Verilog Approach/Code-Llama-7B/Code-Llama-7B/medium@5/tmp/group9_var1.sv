### Explanation:
In the previous example, if we wanted to implement the correct behavior, we would have to index the array
a[I[0]] = I[1] which would index the array from I[0], the first bit of the integer. The proper way to index
a[I[1:0]] is to index the array from the second bit of the integer to the last bit of the integer.
### Results:
A test bench was written to generate the pulses at the output and assert that the pulses are present at the output.
The test bench was written to run simulations of the above module variations and the results are shown below.
