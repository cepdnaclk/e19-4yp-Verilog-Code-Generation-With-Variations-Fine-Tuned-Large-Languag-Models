assert property(d inside {i, i + 1})
else
$error("d = %b, which is not a valid input", d);
end

endmodule
```
### Results
When we compile and run, we see the following two errors reported, the first being on line 22 and the second on line 24:
```
error: ([$root.test_latch.l.d_latch.D, $root.test_latch.l.d_latch.CLK] = d) should use "=:=" because it is not defined as an assignment operation
error: ([$root.test_latch.l.d_latch.D, $root.test_latch.l.d_latch.CLK] = d) should use "=:=" because it is not defined as an assignment operation
```
### Explanation
The inside operator is used with generate statements to check for the value of a variable against an array. An error is reported when the variable value is not present in the array. In this case the variable is d, and the values used are 0, 1, and 2. Since 3 is not present in the array an error is reported.
