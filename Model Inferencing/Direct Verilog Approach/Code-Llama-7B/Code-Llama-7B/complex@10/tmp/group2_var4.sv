### Testbench Modifications:
1. The opnd1, opnd2 and expected_result have been added to test multiplier inputs and expected outputs.
2. The memory arrays have been added to drive data to the bus and expected results.
3. The `Compare_Results` block has been removed and a new block has been added to generate a report of the results.
### Test Results:
```
Test passed
### Testbench Code:
module test_multiplier;
// Testbench setup
reg clk=0, start, error; // Added clk initialization
wire [7:0] databus;
wire lsb_out, msb_out, done;
reg [7:0] mem1[0:2], mem2[0:2]; // Memory for operands
reg [7:0] im_data; // Data to drive onto bus
reg [7:0] opnd1, opnd2; // Operands
reg [15:0] expected_result, multiplier_result; // Results
integer indx; // Loop index
// Instantiate the Multiplier Unit Under Test
Multiplier uut ( clk, start, databus, lsb_out, msb_out, done );
