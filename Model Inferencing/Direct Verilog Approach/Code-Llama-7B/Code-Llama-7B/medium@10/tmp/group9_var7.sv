### Modification Type:
Structural
### Motivation:
To include the array slice to the case expression
### Explanation:
The case expression must be unique in order for the case statement to be synthesizable.  The case expression is also dependent on the value of the input integer I; therefore, if a static case would be sufficient, the loop cannot be combined with the case.
### Reasoning:
The case expression must be unique to support synthesis.  The loop is replaced by a `for` loop, which has a unique case expression.
