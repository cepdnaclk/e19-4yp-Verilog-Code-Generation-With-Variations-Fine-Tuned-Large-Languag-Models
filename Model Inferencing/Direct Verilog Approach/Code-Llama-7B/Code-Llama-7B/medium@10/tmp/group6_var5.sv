module clock_gen_for_loop; // Renamed module for clarity
  reg clk, en;
  // Generate clock using for loop, controlled by 'en'
  always @(posedge en) // Start clock generation on posedge en
    for(clk = 1'b1; en; clk = ~clk) // Toggle clock every 2 time units forever
      #2; // Do nothing, keep clock on
  initial
  begin
    clk = 1'b0; // Initialize clock
    en = 1'b0; // Start disabled
  end
  initial $monitor("clk=%b, t=%0d, en=%b ", clk,$time,en);
endmodule
### Tested Code:
module clock_gen_for_loop_test; // Renamed module for clarity
  reg clk, en;
  clock_gen_for_loop clock_gen_for_loop_inst(.clk,.en); // Clock generation instance
  initial
  begin
    #100 en = 1; // Enable clock
    #200 en = 0; // Disable clock
    #500 $finish; // Exit testbench
  end
endmodule
### Simulation:
- First Simulation:
```
# clock_gen_for_loop_test
# clock_gen_forever

# clock_gen_forever
clk=0, t=0, en=0
#100 clk=0, t=100, en=1
clk=0, t=102, en=1
#200 clk=0, t=302, en=0
#500 $finish
###
```
- Second Simulation:
```
# clock_gen_for_loop_test
# clock_gen_forever

# clock_gen_forever
clk=0, t=0, en=0
#100 clk=0, t=100, en=1
#200 clk=0, t=300, en=0
#500 $finish
###
```

### Design Changes:
- The change was primarily in the for loop. The initial 'clk = 1'b1;' was moved to within the for loop so it is run on every loop.
- Additionally, the '#2' was moved to after the for loop so it is run once after each loop.
- The initial clock value of 0 was moved to within the for loop as well; since it is already initialized to 0, it would be run on every loop,
