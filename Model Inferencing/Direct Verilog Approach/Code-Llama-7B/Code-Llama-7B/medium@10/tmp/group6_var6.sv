### Explanation:
For loop is modified to have a loop index that is calculated via a function call.
The function call is:
  i = i + 1
Function i_inc is defined as follows.
```verilog
function automatic int i_inc(int i);
  i_inc = i + 1;
endfunction
```
The function is automatically registered with the iverilog compiler.
The first time the function is called from within a generate loop, the for loop is entered.
At that point, the loop index is set to 0.
The function is called again on the next iteration of the loop and the loop index is set to 1.
The function is called to increment the loop index on the next iteration and so on.
The value of the function call is the value of the loop index.
The function is called i times, where i is the number of iterations in the loop.
The value of the function call is always one less than the loop iteration number.
