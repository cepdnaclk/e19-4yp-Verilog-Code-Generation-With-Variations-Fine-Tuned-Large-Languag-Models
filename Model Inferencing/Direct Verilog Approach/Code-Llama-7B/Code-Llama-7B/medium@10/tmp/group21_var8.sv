### Unit Test:
To verify the modified code, use the following testbench.

module test(in, out);
  input in; output out;
  reg in; wire out;
  tst_nm_in nm1(out,in); // Instantiate NMOS inverter
endmodule

module tb();
  reg in; wire out;
  tst_nm_in nm2(out,in); // Instantiate NMOS inverter
  initial
  begin
