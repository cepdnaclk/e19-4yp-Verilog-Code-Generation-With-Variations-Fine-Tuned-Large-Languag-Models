### Discussion:
The code is not equivalent.  In the original `forever` loop, the clock toggles 3 times. In the modified `for` loop, the clock toggles once.  The reason is due to the `i = i+1` expression in the for loop.  Every time the for loop runs, the next time the `for` loop will run `i` will be 0.  Thus, the only time the `i` is 1 is the first iteration.  This is why the clock toggles only once.
### Common Suggestions:
If the intention is to have the `clk` signal toggle 3 times, then change the `i` index variable to:
```
  always @(posedge en) // Start clock generation on posedge en
    for (int i=0; i < 3; i=1) clk = ~clk; // Toggle clock every 2 time units forever
```
