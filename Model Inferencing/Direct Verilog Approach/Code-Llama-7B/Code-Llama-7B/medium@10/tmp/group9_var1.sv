  reg [9:0] a,b;
  initial
    while (I<100) begin
      a = I[0]; // Assign bit 1 of I to b (Corrected indexing)
      b = I[1]; // Assign bit 1 of I to b (Corrected indexing)
      Q[I[8:0]] = a + b; //Corrected indexing and a+b assignment.
      I = I + 1; // Increment I
    end
  initial I=0; // Initialize I
  initial #100 $stop; // Stop simulation
endmodule
```
### Explanation:
Since the `Q` is a 9 bit vector, we are storing the value of `a+b` in the corresponding index.
```
  initial
    while (I<100) begin
      a = I[0]; // Assign bit 1 of I to b (Corrected indexing)
      b = I[1]; // Assign bit 1 of I to b (Corrected indexing)
      Q[I[8:0]] = a + b; //Corrected indexing and a+b assignment
      I = I + 1; // Increment I
    end
```
### Assumptions:
- The correct syntax for an inside case expressions using an array-slice range is: `inside { [range] }`.
### Simulation Results:
- **Error**
    - The following error is seen when compiling the above Verilog code:
        - ```ERROR:HDLCompiler:118 -  The case expression at line 628 of my_pulses.v is not a legal expression.```
- **Correction**:
    - To fix this issue we need to include an inside case expression in the code:
- **Modified Code**:
    ```
    initial
      while (I<100) begin
