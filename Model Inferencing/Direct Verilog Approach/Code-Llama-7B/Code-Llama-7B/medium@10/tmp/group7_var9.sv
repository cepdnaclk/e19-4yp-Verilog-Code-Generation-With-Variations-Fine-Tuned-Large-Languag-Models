### Tested Code:
module tb;
logic clk,rst_n;
logic [1:0] in1,in2;
logic [1:0] out;
// Instantiate the module under test
contres dut(.o(out),.i1(in1),.i2(in2));
initial begin
  in1 = 0;
  in2 = 0;
  clk = 1;
  rst_n = 1;
  repeat(6) @(posedge clk);
  in1 = 1;
  in2 = 1;
  repeat(6) @(posedge clk);
  in1 = 0;
  in2 = 0;
  repeat(6) @(posedge clk);
  in1 = 1;
  in2 = 0;
  repeat(6) @(posedge clk);
  in1 = 0;
  in2 = 1;
  repeat(6) @(posedge clk);
  $stop;
end
always #1 clk = ~clk;
endmodule
### Simulation Results:
Initially both in1/in2 are 1
Output is 1.


in1 is 1, in2 is 1
Output is 1.


in1 is 1, in2 is 0
Output is 1.


in1 is 0, in2 is 1
Output is 1.


in1 is 0, in2 is 0
Output is 0.


in1 is 1, in2 is Z
Output is 1.


in1 is 0, in2 is Z
Output is X.


in1 is Z, in2 is Z
Output is Z.
