module test;

typedef enum logic [0:0]
{
    A,
    B = 3,
    C
} test_enum;

reg [0:0] b;

endmodule
The above code is an implementation of the above example.

In the above example, the enumerated types of type wire and reg are replaced with the enumerated types.

The type name of the enumerated type is test_enum.

The number of bits in the enumerated type are changed from 3 to 3.

The enumerated types allow multiple instances of the same type of signals to be packed into one.

15.1.11 System Verilog
The System Verilog synthesis and simulation tool is a powerful language that can be used to create and test hardware designs. It is often used to test the functionality of hardware components and is often used with the RTL synthesis and simulation tool. The System Verilog language is often used with the VCS simulator.

System Verilog language is an extension of Verilog language. This means that it can be used along with Verilog. Verilog is a very low-level language, and it is used for creating hardware designs. System Verilog is a high-level language that can be used to create hardware designs. It is often used as a supplement to the Verilog language.

The System Verilog language is used to create and test hardware components. It is often used in conjunction with the VCS simulator.

System Verilog supports all of the Verilog language features such as data types, operators, expressions, assignment statements, procedural statements, functions, and arrays.

It also supports all of the SystemC language features such as signals, data types, and methods.

15.1.12 Verilog vs. System Verilog
Verilog language is a very low-level language that can be used for creating hardware designs. It is often used in conjunction with the RTL synthesis and simulation tool. System Verilog is a high-level language that can be used to create hardware designs. It is often used as a supplement to Verilog.

The System Verilog language is often used with the VCS simulator.

15.2.1 Simple D Flip-Flop
The following example shows how to create a simple D flip-flop.

### Verilog Code:
module d_flipflop;

input clk;
input d;
output reg q;

always @ (posedge clk) begin
    if (d == 1) q <= 1;
    else if (d == 0) q <= 0;
end

endmodule
In the above example, the input and output signals of the D flip-flop component are defined. The input signal clk is defined to be the clock signal that is used to clock the flip-flop. The input signal d is defined to be the data signal that is used to load the data into the flip-flop. The output signal q is defined to be the output signal of the D flip-flop component.

The logic of the D flip-flop is implemented in the always @ (posedge clk) block. The data signal d is used to determine the value of the output signal q. If the data signal d has a value of 1, the output signal q has a value of 1. If the data signal d has a value of 0, the output signal q has a value of 0.

The D flip-flop is clocked with the clock signal of the input signal clk. When the clock signal of the input signal clk changes from low to high, the conditions that are specified in the always @ (posedge clk) block are checked. If the data signal of the input signal d has a
