### Result:
• The testbench is successfully expanded to include test cases for this function using a dynamic array as operands.
• The test cases include the inputs for the function and include multiple test cases for different input values.
• The test cases can be used to evaluate the function’s behavior.

## Conclusion

The Verilog testbench expansion functionality is a useful tool for testing software components that use Verilog logic blocks. By providing test cases using a dynamic array as a parameter, the testbench can be expanded to include test cases for all types of input operands including string and character arrays. This functionality can be useful for verifying the functionality of Verilog logic blocks in a test harness environment.

### Acknowledgments

• I thank my professor, Dr., for providing the required verilog testbench expansion functionality.
• I would also like to thank my mentor, Dr., for his support and guidance during this project.
