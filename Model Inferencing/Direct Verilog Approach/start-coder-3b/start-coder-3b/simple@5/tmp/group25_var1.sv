### Analysis:
The logic-vector based enum instruction is superior to using the.v file. Using the.v file the instruction is much more concise and clearer. The performance is unaffected by the enum change. It is also important to note that the enum instruction does not have the ability to pass '1' or '0' through a, so it has the potential to be slower.

### Discussion:
The performance of the.v file would be slowed considerably by using the logic-vector instruction. Without the enum instruction, the.v file could be the winner. The logic-vector instruction would only be a tie between
