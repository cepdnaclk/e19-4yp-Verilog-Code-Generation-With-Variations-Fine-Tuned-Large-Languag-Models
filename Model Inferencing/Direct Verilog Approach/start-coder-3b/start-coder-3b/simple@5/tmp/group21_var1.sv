### Expected Results:
1. No errors or warnings
2. No structural aliasing errors
3. 1 assignment statement with 1 blocking assignment statement
### Test Procedure:
1. Verify this test passes all checks
2. Compare expected results and actual results
3. For any differences, add a comment on why the test is failing
4. If the test is failing, change the instructions to fix the bug
5. Repeat steps 1 - 4 until all tests are passing

## Test 11 - Randomize variable name + input/output names, different from the two input/output names
### Base Verilog Code:
