### Instruction Explaination:
Signed Logic Vectors
When I first saw this question, I thought that there was a difference between a signed
and a logic vector. The question does not specify the data type that the output will be,
and the design is not specified. In this way, a signed vector is a vector of signed data.
Therefore, the question must be a signed vector of size 2.
