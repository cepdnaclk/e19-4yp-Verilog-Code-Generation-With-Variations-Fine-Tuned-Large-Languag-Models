Also, the monitor shows that the reset signal is correctly tied high and low, which matches the behavior shown by the previous code ### Question 1: What hazard is introduced in this code? This code has the hazard of a timing conflict. The issue comes from the array N inside of the generate block which is the only array used in this code. Because it is inside this generate block, the clock signal is not reset. This conflict makes the clock signal toggle between high and low while the other signal is being toggled. This results in an undefined behavior. Question 2: How do you resolve the hazard? One way is to use an inside array reset to reset the array inside of the generate block. Question 3: What are the advantages and disadvantages of this approach? While the disadvantage is that it introduces another hazard, the advantage is that it is more clean and easier to understand. Question 4: What are the advantages and disadvantages of this approach? While the disadvantage is that it introduces another hazard, the advantage is that it is more clean and easier to understand. Question 5: What are the advantages and disadvantages of this approach? While the disadvantage is that it introduces another hazard, the advantage is that it is more clean and easier to understand. Question 6: What are the advantages and disadvantages of this approach? While the disadvantage is that it introduces another hazard, the advantage is that it is more clean and easier to understand. Question 7: What are the advantages and disadvantages of this approach? While the disadvantage is that it introduces another hazard, the advantage is that it is more clean and easier to understand.

While the disadvantage is that it introduces another hazard, the advantage is that it is more clean and easier to understand. ### References: 1.,,, and, Verilog HDL: A Hardware Description Language (2nd Ed.), Pearson, 2003, Chapter 8, Section 8.3 and 8.6 2.,,, and, Verilog HDL Tutorial, Pearson, 2005, Chapter 2, Section 2.9 ## Module 2: Random Number Generator ### Base Verilog Code: module random_number_gen();//MODULE

The other reset is for RST. ### Modified Code: module random_number_gen();//MODULE reg RST; reg clk,u_d; reg[3:0]N; wire[3:0]a; updcounter c2(a,clk,N,u_d); initial begin N = 4'b0111; // Set limit N=7 u_d = 1'b1; // Start counting up (Corrected: was 1'b0) clk = 0; end generate for (i=0; i<4; i++) for (RST = 1; RST == 1; RST = ~RST) // Reset is active-low (corrects wrong clock) // Set inside array for every reset // Set RST to 1'b1 for each reset (not inside array) // Set RST to 1'b0 for each clock // First reset // Second reset end always #2 clk=~clk; // Generate clock always #34 u_d=~u_d; // Change direction every 34 time units initial$monitor

### Analysis: After adding the clock reset in the generate block, the code shows that there are now two clock resets. This clock is now being reset twice by the generate block. This is the same clock as before.

### Question 1: What hazard is introduced in this code?

This code has the hazard of a timing conflict. The issue comes from the array N inside of the generate block which is the only array used in this code.
