##### Expected Results:
msb_out is the most significant byte of the result.
lsb_out is the least significant byte of the result.
##### Actual Results:
lsb_out = 2;

##### Test Summary:

Pass/Fail Criteria:

If `error` is asserted, the test has failed.

If `error` does not asserted, the test has passed.

Test Type:

For this test, a positive edge on `clk` is generated to synchronize the test and increment the operand values. All other signals remain at 0 (low).

Test Description:

This test cycles through the 4-bit inputs to the multiplier unit. The 8-bit inputs are first loaded into `mem1` at `Apply_Data`. The result is then compared to the expected result at `Compare_Results`.

Test Setup:

Test Driven Design:

The `Apply_Data` and `Compare_Results` blocks are placed in their own sub-blocks within the `Generate` block.
