## Synthesis Issues

The most common issues arise when synthesizing Verilog code for FPGA implementations are the following:

• Sufficiently wide data nets. This can be avoided using the [unmapped] attribute on wires, or using constant nets to reduce the total net width.
• Unconnected wires. This can be avoided using the [unmapped] attribute on wires.
• Unconnected inputs to registers. This can be avoided using initial values on registers.
• Unconnected inputs to combinational logic. This can be avoided either by using a combinational library cell, by using a flip-flop or by using a $null assignment in an initial block. Unmapped wires can be used to connect the combinational logic to a register. Wire data types can be used to make it easier to map between the two. • Unconnected inputs to block-level logic. This can be avoided either by using a combinational library cell, by using a flip-flop or by adding a $null assignment. Unmapped wires can be used to connect the block-level logic to the flip-flop.
• Combinational logic taking the value stored in a flip-flop as input. This can be avoided by using a library cell, by using a flip-flop, or by adding a $null assignment. • Combinational logic with data stored in a flip-flop that is not updated in the current time frame. The combination of a flip-flop and a $null assignment can be used to ensure that the current value of the flip-flop is read during the current time frame.
• Combinational logic with data stored in a register that is not updated in the current time frame. The combination of a register and a $null assignment can be used to ensure that the current value of the register is read during the current time frame. • Combinational logic updating the value stored in a flip-flop. A flip-flop can be used to update the data value stored in the flip-flop. The data type of the flip-flop can be used to ensure that the new value is written to the flip-flop. • Register updating the value stored in a register. A register can be used to update the data value stored in the register. The data type of the register can be used to ensure that the new value is written to the register. • Combinational logic updating the value stored in a combinational logic. A combinational logic can be used to update the data value stored in the combinational logic. The data type of the combinational logic can be used to ensure that the new value is written to the combinational logic. ## Verilog Code Examples ### Single-Cycle Flip-Flop module flipflop(input clk, input din, output reg q); // single cycle flip-flop with input data din and clock clk reg q; // output register q always @(posedge clk) // update flip-flop q <= din; endmodule ### Single-Cycle Multi-Input Flip-Flop module flipflop(input [1:0] din, input clk, output reg q); // single cycle multi-input flip-flop with input data din and clock clk reg q; // output register q always @(posedge clk) // update flip-flop q
