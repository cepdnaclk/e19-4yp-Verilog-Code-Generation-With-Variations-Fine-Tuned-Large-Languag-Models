### 4.6.4.4.3. Nested Generate Blocks

A generate block may contain a nested generate block. This is called a nested generate block.

The body of a nested generate block is executed every time the outer generate block is executed. The bodies of nested generate blocks are executed if the current value of the generate parameter is matched. Note that this does not indicate that the code in the nested generate block will be executed once for each match. The code will be executed once for each time the outer generate block is executed. For example:

```module hex7seg_le (
input wire [3:0] x,
output wire [6:0] a_to_g
);
// Logic equations for each segment (active high assumed)
generate
for (i = 0; i < 4; i = i+1) begin: inside
generate
for (j = 0; j < 2; j = j+1) begin: inside_inside
assign a_to_g[6+i] = ~x[3] & ~x[2] & ~x[1] & x[0] // a (segment index 6)
| ~x[3] & x[2] & ~x[1] & ~x[0]
| x[3] & x[2] & ~x[1] & x[0]
| x[3] & ~x[2] & x[1] & x[0];
end
endgenerate
end
endgenerate
endmodule
```

The result of the example above is the same as that of the first example:

#### Problem 10

This is a slightly expanded version of the previous example.

```module hex7seg_le (
input wire [3:0] x,
output wire [6:0] a_to_g
);
// Logic equations for each segment (active high assumed)
generate
for (i = 0; i < 4; i = i+1) begin: inside
generate
for (j = 0; j < 2; j = j+1) begin: inside_inside
generate
for (k = 0; k < 2; k = k+1) begin: inside_inside_inside
assign a_to_g[6+i] = ~x[3] & ~x[2] & ~x[1] & x[0] // a (segment index 6)
| ~x[3] & x[2] & ~x[1] & ~x[0]
| x[3] & x[2] & ~x[1] & x[0]
| x[3] & ~x[2] & x[1] & x[0];
end
endgenerate
end
endgenerate
end
endgenerate
endmodule
```

This program will result in the program hanging since a_to_g[6] is a combination of 6 other wires.

### 4.6.4.4.4. Generate Blocks with Conditionals

There is a special form of conditional that can be used in a generate block. This conditional is called the “if_else” conditional. The syntax of this conditional is:

```generate
if (generate_condition)
gen_statement
else
gen_statement
endgenerate
```

The condition may be any expression that evaluates to a Boolean value. The statements inside the generate block will be generated only if the condition is true.

The following example shows how to use this conditional:

```module hex7seg_le (
input wire [3:0] x,
output wire [6:0] a_to_g
);
// Logic equations for each segment (active high assumed)
generate
for (i = 0; i < 4; i = i+1) begin: inside
generate
if (x[2] == 1)
assign a_to_g[6+i] = 1'b0;
else
assign a_to_g[6+i] = ~x[3] & ~x[2] & ~x[1] & x[0] // a (segment index 6)
| ~x[3] & x[2] & ~x[1] & ~x[0]
| x[3] & x[2] & ~x[1] & x[0]
| x[3] & ~x[2] & x[1] & x[0];
end
endgenerate
endgenerate
endmodule
```

Sometimes, it is useful to use the generate conditional to break out of the current generate block. The syntax is:

```generate
if (generate_condition)
gen_statement_1
else if (generate_condition_1)
gen_statement_2
else if (generate_condition_2)
gen_statement_n
else
gen_statement_n+1
endgenerate
```

The condition may be any expression that evaluates to a Boolean value. The statements inside the generate block will be generated only if the condition is true. When the condition is false, the generation of statements is terminated and processing moves to the next conditional.

This example uses the if_else conditional to break out of a generate block:

```module hex7seg_le (
input wire [3:0] x,
output wire [6:0] a_to_g
);
// Logic equations for each segment (active high assumed)
generate
for (i = 0; i < 4; i = i+1) begin: inside
generate
if (x[2] == 1)
assign a_to_g[6+i] = 1'b0;
else if (x[1] == 1)
assign a_to_g[6+i] = 1'b0;
else
gen_statement
end
endgenerate
endgenerate
endmodule
```

## 4.6.5. Generate and Parametric Simulation

Generates are used to simulate models that depend on parameters. Using generates and parameters, you can simulate models that relate to different parameter values. For example, we can use a generate to simulate 6 different models. To do this, we must use a different parameter for each model, and we must use a different name for each model — for example, model_1, model_2, model_3, etc.

First, we declare the generate block. Then, we use the generate keyword to open a new parameter scope. Inside the parameter scope, we can reference the generate parameter to create the new parameter name. Finally, we close the parameter scope by including the end generate keyword. To see an example of this, consider the following code:

```module test_pkg;

reg [3:0] reg1;
reg [4:0] reg2;

generate

always @(posedge clk) begin
generate

assign reg1 = 0;
assign reg2 = 0;
end
endgenerate

endmodule
```

In this example, we have a module named test_pkg that contains a register named reg1 and a register named reg2. Note that the generate blocks are nested. The first generate block contains two assign statements that set the value of reg1 to 0, and the value of reg2 to 0. The second generate block contains two assign statements that set the value of reg1 to 1, and the value of reg2 to 1.

The result of running this code is shown here:

```model_1
model_2
```

These are the names of the models that are created. The model_1 name is derived from the first generate block, and the model_2 name is derived from the second generate block.

Generates are
