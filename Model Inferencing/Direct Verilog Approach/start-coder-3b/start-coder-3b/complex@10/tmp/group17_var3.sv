input wire [N-1:0] y,
output reg gt, // Greater than
output reg eq, // Equal

// Default outputs to 0
gt = 1'b0;
eq = 1'b0;

// Set flags based on comparison results
in_out = in_out_function(x,y);
gt = in_out[0];
eq = in_out[1];
lt = in_out[2];
end
endmodule
int[3:0] in_out_function(int[N-1:0] x, int[N-1:0] y)
