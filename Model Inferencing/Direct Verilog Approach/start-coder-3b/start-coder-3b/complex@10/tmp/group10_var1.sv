### Differences:

**Inside:**
* There is a new operator `inside`. It checks if the value is inside a constant declared in interface scope.
**End:**
* There are 2 changes in  `end` lines.
* The first `end` is replaced with `end`
* The second `end` is replaced with `end`
* It means, if `end` is defined inside a constant, the constant will be ended.
**Q_B <= 0:**
* There is a new statement `q_b <= 0;` inserted after `end` lines.
