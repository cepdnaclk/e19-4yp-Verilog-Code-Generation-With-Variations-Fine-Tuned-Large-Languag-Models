### Test Behavior:
• The testbench should now correctly display the correct enable and input signal values.
• The output signal should reflect that of the selected input data source.
• The output should be indeterminate (undefined) when enable is 1 and inputs are unselected.

## 3.5 Using the generate Block with Initial Output Signal Assignments

In the previous section, we introduced the generate keyword and the inside operator along with a few examples for how they could be used. The generate block introduces a new scoping and visibility mechanism which allows it to be used at the top level of a module or in a sequence of statements. A generate block may be instantiated multiple times, generating the same code multiple times, so it is good practice to name the block as a prefix or suffix in order to disambiguate the code. In addition, blocks may be nested to create more hierarchical code. Generate blocks are used to create multiple instances of a process, block, package, or module. The generate block executes at the top level of a module or in a sequence of statements. The generate block is used with the generate keyword and the inside operator. The inside operator is a bit strange, but it is used so that
