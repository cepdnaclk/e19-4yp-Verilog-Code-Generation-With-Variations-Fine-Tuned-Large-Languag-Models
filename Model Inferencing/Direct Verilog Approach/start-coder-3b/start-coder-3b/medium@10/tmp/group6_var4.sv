### Observation:
The results of the test above can be verified by executing the code.  You may run into a problem if the code is being run in simulation.  If this is the case, you may want to run it with the following command on the command line:

```
vsim -sv -do "do sim.do" work.clock_gen_while
```

This command will run the simulation in batch mode, and you will not be able to view the results. To see the results, you can
