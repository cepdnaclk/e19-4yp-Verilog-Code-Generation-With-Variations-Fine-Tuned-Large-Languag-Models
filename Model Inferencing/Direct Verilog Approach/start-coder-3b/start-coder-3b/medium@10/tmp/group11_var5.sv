## How To Use Variation Instruction to Solve Conflicts

Every variation instruction has a different type of conflict you can solve with it. Variation instructions can help you solve different types of conflict.

### Conflict Types

#### Multiple Sequential Conflict

Multiple sequential conflicts involve multiple sequential statements that have the same value. Multiple sequential conflicts can be solved using initial blocks.

#### Multiple Assignment Conflict

Multiple assignment conflicts involve multiple assignments where the same data flows through each assignment. Multiple assignment conflicts can be solved using sequential statements in an initial block.

#### Nested Assignment Conflict

Nested assignment conflicts involve assignments that are nested within each other. Nested assignment conflicts can be solved using sequential statements in an
