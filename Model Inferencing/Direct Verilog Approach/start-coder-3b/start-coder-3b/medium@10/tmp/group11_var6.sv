module aoi2(g,a,b,c,d);
output g;
input a,b,c,d;
wire e,f,g1;
initial begin
assign e = a && b;
assign f = c && d;
assign g1 = e || f;
end
assign g = ~g1;
endmodule

## Explanation

### Base Verilog Code

The initial block of module aoi1 is executed when the simulator is started before any simulation events (process or initial statements) are executed.

In the initial block of the module, the intermediate signals e, f and g1 are assigned the same values as the inputs a, b, c and d.

The final output g is assigned the opposite of final intermediate signal g1.

### Variation Instruction

The assign statement has an indexing expression using an inside function call.

The inside function call is the function AOI2_INITIAL_VALUE which returns a random value of type aoi2_initial_value_type. The type of this function is defined as AOI2_INITIAL_VALUE.

The returned value is assigned to the intermediate signal corresponding to the input of this module.

### Modified Code

The assign statement has a left-hand side expression which is an indexing expression of g1 in a similar way as before using the indexing expression of aoi2_initial_value_type.

The index expression is used as input to the function AOI2_INITIAL_VALUE.

The function returns a random value of type aoi2_initial_value_type.

The returned value is assigned to the intermediate signal corresponding to the input of this module.

## Source Code

module aoi2(g,a,b,c,d);
output g;
input a,b,c,d;
wire e,f,g1;
initial begin
assign e = a && b;
assign f = c && d;
assign g1 = e || f;
end
assign g = ~g1;
endmodule

## Generated Simulation

The simulation result is a random output each time the simulation is started.

The simulation result is as follows.

The initial block assign statement uses a random value of type aoi2_initial_value_type as input to the function AOI2_INITIAL_VALUE.

The function returns a random value of type aoi2_initial_value_type.

The returned value is assigned to the intermediate signal corresponding to the input of this module.

The assign statement has an indexing expression of g in a similar way as before using the indexing expression of aoi2_initial_value_type.

The index expression is used as input to the function AOI2_INITIAL_VALUE.

The function returns a random value of type aoi2_initial_value_type.

The returned value is assigned to the intermediate signal corresponding to the input of this module.

The final output g is assigned the opposite of final intermediate signal g1.

The final output of the initial block is assigned to the intermediate signal corresponding to the input of this module.

The intermediate signal corresponding to this module is assigned the opposite of the final output of the initial block.

## Example Result
