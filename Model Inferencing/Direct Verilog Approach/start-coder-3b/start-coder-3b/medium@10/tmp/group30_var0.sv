The following Verilog code snippet uses shift-left semantics to implement the add-with-carry operation. This operation is also known as C-Scan.

module carry_add_32(cin, a, b, cout, s);

output [31:0] s, cout;
reg [31:0] x, y, z;

y = b + c;
z = x + y;

### Description

This page is a summary of the variation instruction for Verilog. The basic syntax is as follows:

`instruction(arg1, arg2,...)`

The instruction can be from the following variations:

• Arithmetic
• Bit-wise
• Logical
• Comparison
• Timing
• Scheduling
• Data Flow
• Random
• Memory

### Arithmetic Variations

The following Verilog code snippet adds two operands and gives the output as a 32-bit integer. This addition does not overflow.

module add
(
input [31: 0] a,
input [31: 0] b,
output [31: 0] s
);

always @(*)
s = a + b;

endmodule

The result is 0x00000000.
