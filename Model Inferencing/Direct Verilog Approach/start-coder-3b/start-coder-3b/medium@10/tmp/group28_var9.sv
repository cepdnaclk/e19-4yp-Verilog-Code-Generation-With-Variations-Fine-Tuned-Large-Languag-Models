title: "How to connect an ESP32 to a 2-port switch using its GPIO pins"
date: 2022-03-23 00:00:00
---

## Introduction

This post details how to connect an ESP32 to a 2-port switch using its GPIO pins. This makes it possible to control the 2-port switch using an ESP32 via software.

## The Design

The design is as follows:

* An ESP32 module will be used. The ESP32 module will be connected to the 2-port switch via the GPIO pins.
* The ESP32 module will have GPIO pins connected to the 2-port switch.
* The ESP32 module will be programmed using the Arduino IDE to drive the 2-port switch.
* The ESP32 module will be programmed using the Arduino IDE to monitor the 2-port switch status.

## Hardware Connections

The connections are as follows:

* The ESP32 module must be connected to the 2-port switch via the GPIO pins.
* The ESP32 module's GPIO pins must be connected to the 2-port switch.

## Software Implementation

The following software implementation can be used to connect an ESP32 module to a 2-port switch over its GPIO pins:

```cpp
#include <Arduino.h>

const int pinA = 2; // Pin A on the 2-port switch
const int pinB = 4; // Pin B on the 2-port switch
const int pinEn = 13; // Pin EN on the 2-port switch

void setup()
{
    Serial.begin(9600);
    pinMode(pinA, OUTPUT);
    pinMode(pinB, OUTPUT);
    pinMode(pinEn, OUTPUT);
}

void loop()
{
    // Turn ON the 2-port switch
    digitalWrite(pinA, HIGH);
    digitalWrite(pinB, HIGH);
    digitalWrite(pinEn, HIGH);
    Serial.print("2-port switch turned ON\n");

    // Wait for 5 seconds
    delay(5000);

    // Turn OFF the 2-port switch
    digitalWrite(pinA, LOW);
    digitalWrite(pinB, LOW);
    digitalWrite(pinEn, LOW);
    Serial.print("2-port switch turned OFF\n");

    // Wait for 5 seconds
    delay(5000);
}
```

## Testing the Implementation

To test the implementation, refer to the following steps:

1. Load the software on the ESP32 module.
2. Start the serial monitor.
3. Turn ON the 2-port switch.
4. Observe the serial output. The output should indicate that the 2-port switch has been turned ON.
5. Wait for 5 seconds.
6. Turn OFF the 2-port switch.
7. Observe the serial output. The output should indicate that the 2-port switch has been turned OFF.
8. Wait for 5 seconds.
9. Repeat steps 3-8 to test the functionality of the 2-port switch.

    pinMode(A5, OUTPUT);
}

void loop()
{
    // Read the battery voltage
    int batteryVoltage = analogRead(A5);

    // Determine if the battery is LOW or HIGH
    if (batteryVoltage < 50)
    {
        digitalWrite(A5, LOW);
    }
    else
    {
        digitalWrite(A5, HIGH);
    }
}

## Prerequisites

The following prerequisites are required to connect a USB port to a Raspberry Pi using a USB-C cable:

* Raspberry Pi installed with a Linux operating system.
* The Raspberry Pi is connected to a USB port.
* A USB-C cable installed for connecting the USB port to the Raspberry Pi.

## Connection Details

The following diagram details the connection details of the USB-C cable required for connecting a USB port to a Raspberry Pi:

![USB-C Cable Diagram](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.electronics-tutorials.ws%2Fimages%2Fusb-c%2Fusb-c-cable-3.gif&f=1&nofb=1)

The USB-C cable has two connectors:

* A USB Type-C connector.
* A female USB connector.

To connect a USB port to a Raspberry Pi, the USB Type-C connector must be connected to the Raspberry Pi.

## Connection Example

To connect a USB port to a Raspberry Pi using a USB-C cable, refer to the following steps:

1. Ensure that the Raspberry Pi is connected to a power supply.
2. Ensure that the Raspberry Pi is connected to a USB port.
3. Connect the USB-C cable to the USB port.
4. Place the USB-C cable between the Type-C connector and the female USB connector.
5. Connect the USB-C cable to the USB port.

## Testing the Connection

To test the connection, refer to the following steps:

1. Check that the Raspberry Pi is connected to a power supply.
2. Check that the Raspberry Pi is connected to a USB port.
3. Connect the USB-C cable to the USB port.
4. Check that the USB-C cable is connected to the Type-C connector.
5. Check that the USB-C cable is connected to the female USB connector.

If all the above steps are followed properly, the USB-C cable will be connected to the USB port and will be connected to the Type-C connector.
