### Explanation:
When the instruction is performed, the compiler will compile the code into logic, and the logic then will evaluate from the top down as it follows the always @ always_comb.
First, the always @ always_comb block will assign the logic of the operands, bitwise AND, XOR and addition as a result.
### Result:
After all the logic has been
