### Results:
• The original code is more compact and allows for more efficient testbenches because it is more generic and can be used for any length, width and type of inputs, instead of having to test each individually.
• The modified code is easier to read and understand.
• The modified code generates fewer testcases compared to the original code, since they are all generated by using bitwise operations on the struct.

## Summary

The aim of this project was to test the performance of a 64-bit synthesizable parallel array with multiple testbenches which take inputs of different lengths, widths and types of logic values. Three testbenches are implemented, each one for a different instruction and logic operation in the synthesized design. They are:

• The first testbench is for a “bitwise not” operation where the width of the input is unknown.
• The second testbench is for a “bitwise and” operation where the width of the input is unknown.
• The third testbench is for a “bitwise parity” operation where the width of the input is unknown.

## Conclusion

• The parallel structure allows for efficient testbenches for multiple inputs of different widths and lengths.
• It also allows for more generic testbenches and is less time consuming than a testbench for each individual input.
• This makes it a better candidate for implementation in the FPGA.

## Appendix

A copy of the original verilog code is provided below. It includes the declaration of logic fields for the unpacked inputs, an assignment of the inputs into these fields and then the actual logic operation on the fields.

module par(in, parity, all_ones);
input [7:0] in;
output parity, all_ones;

struct logic [7:0] {logic [0:3] x1, x0} in_struct;

assign in_struct.x1 = {in[3:0], in[7:4]};
assign in_struct.x0 = in[7:4];

assign parity = ^in_struct.x1 ^ ^in_struct.x0;
assign all_ones = &in_struct.x1 & &in_struct.x0;

endmodule
A copy of the modified verilog code is provided below. It uses the parallel structure to unpack the input into the struct and then apply the operations on the struct.
module par(in, parity, all_ones);
input [7:0] in;
output parity, all_ones;

struct logic [7:0] {logic [0:3] x1, x0} in_struct;

assign in_struct.x1 = {in[3:0], in[7:4]};
assign in_struct.x0 = in[7:4];

assign parity = ^in_struct.x1 ^ ^in_struct.x0;
assign all_ones = &in_struct.x1 & &in_struct.x0;

endmodule

The design was then synthesised using the ABC9.2 software package. After the synthesis process, the resulting verilog source code was converted into a netlist file using the ABC9.2 software, which was converted into an ELF file using the S2E software, which was then converted into a C file. The resulting C file was then compiled using the gcc compiler and then executed using the simulator in the S2E software.
