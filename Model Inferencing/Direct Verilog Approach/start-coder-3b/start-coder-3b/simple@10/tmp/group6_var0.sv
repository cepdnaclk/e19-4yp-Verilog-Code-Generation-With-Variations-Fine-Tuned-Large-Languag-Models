### Verilog Code:
always @(a or b or c or d)
// Debouncing switch with a 10 ms delay after each debouncing cycle
if (!switch) switch_bounce_delay <= 1'b0;
else if (switch) switch_bounce_delay <= 1'b1;
// Debouncing switch with a 10 ms delay after each debouncing cycle
if (!switch) switch_bounce_delay <= 1'b0 after 10 us;
else if (switch) switch_bounce_delay <= 1'b1 after 10 us;
### Variation Instruction:
Remove all of the logic surrounding the switch_bounce_delay signal as it is just being used to debounce the switch signal and replace it with the following line of code.
delay(10);

### Verilog Code:
always @(a or b or c1 or c2)
// Debouncing switch with a 10 ms delay after each debouncing cycle
if (!switch) switch_bounce_delay <= 1'b0 after 10 us;
else if (switch) switch_bounce_delay <= 1'b1 after 10 us;

else if (switch) switch_bounce_delay <= 1'b1 after 10 us;
### Variation Instruction:
Remove the logic surrounding the switch_bounce_delay signal and replace it with the following single line of code.
delay(10);

### Verilog Code:
// Debouncing switch with a 10 ms delay after each debouncing cycle
if (!switch) switch_bounce_delay <= 1'b0;
else if (switch) switch_bounce_delay <= 1'b1;
// Debouncing switch with a 10 ms delay after each debouncing cycle
if (!switch) switch_bounce_delay <= 1'b0 after 10 us;
else if (switch) switch_bounce_delay <= 1'b1 after 10 us;
### Variation Instruction:
Remove all of the debouncing logic from the first two if blocks and replace this code with the following single line of code.
delay(10);

### Verilog Code:
output_pulse <= 1'b0;
delay(10);
output_pulse <= 1'b1;

### Variation Instruction:
Replace all of the code with a single line of code.
delay(10);

### Variation Instruction:
Remove all of the delay logic from the code and replace the entire code block with the following single line of code.
delay(10);
