### Baseline Results:

clock speed: 1GHz

Simulation Results:

clock speed: 1GHz

Simulation Results:

• The original code was correct.
• The modified code was correct.
• I used the same testbench for both modified and original code.
• The modified code is faster.
• The modified code has the same performance as the original code.

## Test 8: Pipelined RAM Cell with Sequential DFFs

In this test, I created a simple testbench for a pipelined RAM cell with sequential DFFs.

### Base Verilog Code:
module PipelinedRAM_Cell_
