### Tests:
1 - Verify that b is randomized
2 - Verify that a is randomized
3 - Verify that f is randomized
4 - Verify that the final result (f) satisfies the given expressions.

### Questions

1)

Is this a randomized structure?

Yes. Each of the statements in this structure has a random input.

2)

Does the final result (f) satisfy the given expressions?

No. The final result is the same as in the original design.

3)

Generate some random seeds that cause the final result (f) of this design to satisfy the given expressions.

Using a 32-bit seed value of 1211544672, we can see that f is 0 at the end.
