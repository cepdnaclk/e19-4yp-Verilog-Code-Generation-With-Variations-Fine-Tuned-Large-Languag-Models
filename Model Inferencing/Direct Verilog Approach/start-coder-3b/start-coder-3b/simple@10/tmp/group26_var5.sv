## Detailed Description

The example for nested unpacked structure handling shows the way of using unpacked nested structure in the Verilog language. The unpacked nested structure can be used in the declaration of a module's output.

For example, the declaration of the gade module shown below is declared as the output of the module. Because the output is a vector of four 8-bit signed integers, you must use a nested unpacked structure to describe the output.

module gade(a,a1,b,c,b1,c1);
input b,c,b1,c1;
output a,a1;
// Instantiate OR gate with inertial delay 3
or #3 gg1(a1,c1,b1);
// Instantiate AND gate with rise=2, fall=1 inertial delay
and #(2,1) gg2(a,c,b);
endmodule
