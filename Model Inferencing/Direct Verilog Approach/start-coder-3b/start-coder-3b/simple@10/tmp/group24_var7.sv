module Anding (input a, b, output y);
and (y, a, b);
endmodule

### Test Code:

module TestAnding;
reg a, b;
wire y;
Anding uut (.a(a),.b(b),.y(y));
initial begin
a = 0;
b = 0;
#5 a = 1;
#5 b = 1;
#5 a = 0;
#5 b = 0;
#5 a = 1;
#5 b = 1;
#5 a = 0;
#5 b = 0;
#5 a = 1;
#5 b = 1;
end
endmodule

### Results:

I think we see a problem with this testbench. For one thing, I think the testbench should be able to drive the inputs a and b directly. Since the testbench is only connecting the a and b inputs to the Anding sub-module (the Anding sub-module is not connecting its input to a and b, which is where you would use a and b if you wanted to directly drive a and b), it seems like the testbench should only use the ports of the Anding sub-module.

So, at the very least, I think we need to change the testbench to look like this:

module TestAnding;
reg a, b;
wire y;
Anding uut (.a(a),.b(b),.y(y));
initial begin
a = 0;
b = 0;
#5 a = 1;
#5 b = 1;
#5 a = 0;
#5 b = 0;
#5 a = 1;
#5 b = 1;
#5 a = 0;
#5 b = 0;
#5 a = 1;
#5 b = 1;
end
endmodule

Or, if you really insist that the testbench drives the inputs directly, then I think we need to change the testbench to look like this:

module TestAnding;
wire [1:0] a;
wire [1:0] b;
wire y;
Anding uut (.a(a),.b(b),.y(y));
initial begin
a[0] = 0;
a[1] = 0;
b[0] = 0;
b[1] = 0;
#5 a[0] = 1;
#5 a[1] = 1;
#5 b[0] = 1;
#5 b[1] = 1;
#5 a[0] = 0;
#5 a[1] = 0;
#5 b[0] = 0;
#5 b[1] = 0;
#5 a[0] = 1;
#5 a[1] = 1;
#5 b[0] = 1;
#5 b[1] = 1;
end
endmodule

Note the change in a and b from reg a and b to wire [1:0] a and wire [1:0] b.

In my opinion, the DFF sub-module should use a packed union. So, I think you should change the DFF sub-module to use a packed union.

module DFF (input in, output out, output reg q);

If the default of a sub-module’s port is packed, then any default for a port’s sub-port should be the same. In this case, the DFF should allow the default for q to be either wire or reg.

### Test Code 2:

#100 creg a = 2’b11;
#100 creg b = 2’b10;

module Anding (input a, b, output y);
and (y, a, b);
endmodule

module TestAnding;
reg a, b;
wire y;
Anding uut (.a(a),.b(b),.y(y));
initial begin
a = 0;
b = 0;
#5 a = 1;
#5 b = 1;
#5 a = 0;
#5 b = 0;
#5 a = 1;
#5 b = 1;
#5 a = 0;
#5 b = 0;
#5 a = 1;
#5 b = 1;
end
endmodule

### Results:

This testbench is still showing a problem. For one thing, it still uses a reg to drive the inputs.

So, at the very least, our testbench should drive the input a and b directly. We can do this by either giving it a wire a and b or we can give it a packed union a and b. Since we need to give it a packed union a and b, we will need to define wire [1:0] a and wire [1:0] b.

module TestAnding;
wire [1:0] a;
wire [1:0] b;
wire y;
Anding uut (.a(a),.b(b),.y(y));
initial begin
a[0] = 0;
a[1] = 0;
b[0] = 0;
b[1] = 0;
#5 a[0] = 1;
#5 a[1] = 1;
#5 b[0] = 1;
#5 b[1] = 1;
#5 a[0] = 0;
#5 a[1] = 0;
#5 b[0] = 0;
#5 b[1] = 0;
#5 a[0] = 1;
#5 a[1] = 1;
#5 b[0] = 1;
#5 b[1] = 1;
end
endmodule

However, we still have a problem. Since we are using a packed union, the testbench can’t set the default value of a and b.

So, I think we need to update the testbench to use a packed union rather than a reg.
