## Combinational Logic

Combinational logic is a set of digital circuits which can be used to implement logical functions. They are constructed using logic gates such as AND, OR, and NOT gates. Combinational logic is useful for designing components that have no internal memory.

Combinational logic can be used to implement combinational logic in the form of a verilog module. Modules are the fundamental building blocks of Verilog. Modules are defined by the following components:

• A module header, which specifies the module name and inputs and outputs
• A module body, which contains all of the module logic
Combinational logic can be described as follows:
module mod_name(in1, in2,... inN, out);

input in1, in2,... inN;
output out;

assign out = in1 & in2 &... & inN;

endmodule

## Basic Combinational Logic

Combinational logic is used in a variety of ways, but it is best explained by using a simple example. Consider the following combinational logic, given as a Verilog module:

module add(in1, in2, out);
input in1, in2;
output out;

assign out = in1 + in2;

endmodule

This combinational logic adds two numbers together and outputs the result. The input to the module, in1, is connected to a first bit input of the adder and the input to the module, in2, is connected to a second bit input of the adder. The output, out, is connected to the output of the adder.

This is a good example of a combinational logic being used as a module. The input and outputs are declared at the module header with declarations such as: input in1, in2; output out. Using this notation, a module is declared with the following module header:

module mod_name(in1, in2,... inN, out);

Now the Verilog code for this basic combinational logic is:

module add(in1, in2, out);
input in1, in2;
output out;

assign out = in1 + in2;

endmodule

## Verilog HDL

Verilog is a Hardware Description Language designed for use in hardware design and digital logic circuitry. Verilog syntax is much easier to read than pure binary instructions.

It does not require many new concepts to be introduced to Verilog. However, Verilog is used extensively in designing embedded systems.

## Hardware Description Language

A hardware description language (HDL) defines the layout of a hardware design. It defines the input and output signals of a hardware design. HDL languages are used extensively to create circuits and their layouts.

HDLs are used to design systems that contain digital logic, processors, and other components.

## Computer-Aided Design

Computer-aided design (CAD) is a specialized computerized engineering technique that uses the computer to guide the designer of a design by generating designs. It is important to consider a CAD program for an engineering project because it can generate a design before the actual design begins. This saves time spent on design iterations and allows for designing more efficient solutions.

A CAD program for a project can be used to create many designs and allow the designer to choose the best design.

### Pros of Using a CAD Program

The following are the pros of using a CAD program for the design process:

• Saves time. CAD programs can generate many designs before the design process begins. They can be used to generate many designs that are similar or even the same. Each design saved can be optimized. Spending time on design iterations can be saved.
• Saves money. Spending time on design iterations can be saved by using a CAD program to generate many designs and then choosing the best design.
• Improves the project. The project can be optimized by using a CAD program to generate many designs.
• Reduces failure. If a CAD program is used to generate many designs, a failure can be identified as the worst case design. This design can be optimized in the future.

### Cons of Using a CAD Program

The following are the cons of using a CAD program for the design process:

• Saves time. CAD programs can generate many designs before the design process begins. They can be used to generate many designs that are similar or even the same. Each design saved can be optimized. Spending time on design iterations can be saved.
• Saves money. Spending time on design iterations can be saved by using a CAD program to generate many designs and then choosing the best design.

## Using a CAD Program

A CAD program for the design process can be used to generate many designs, such as a design for a CPU, before the actual design begins. The CAD program can be used to generate many designs and choose the best design.

### Generating Multiple Designs

A CAD program can be used to generate multiple designs and allow the designer to choose the best design. The multiple designs can be used for the design process, such as verifying the design.

### Choosing the Best Design

A CAD program can be used to generate multiple designs and allow the designer to choose the best design. The CAD program can be used by an engineer to choose the best design.
