### RenameVisitor Class

The `RenameVisitor` class inherits from the `PatternVisitor` class and is responsible for identifying all occurrences of the old signal name in the Verilog module. It takes two parameters: `old_name` and `new_name`. These parameters are used to perform the text transformation on the signals.

The `__init__()` method initializes the visitor with the `patterns` object, which is a list of regular expressions that define the patterns to search for in the Verilog module. The `visit_module()` method traverses all elements in the module and invokes the `visit_element()` method on each element.

### visit_element Method

The `visit_element()` method is responsible for identifying the occurrences of the old signal name in the Verilog module. It uses the `re` module to perform a regular expression search for the old signal name in the text representation of the element. If a match is found, it replaces the old signal name with the new signal name and prints a message indicating that the signal was renamed.

### Patterns Object

The `patterns` object is a list of regular expressions that define the patterns to search for in the Verilog module. Each pattern in the list consists of a tuple containing the old signal name and the new signal name, separated by a comma. For example:
```
patterns = [
    ("old_name", "new_name"),
    ("another_old_name", "new_name2")
]
```
This list defines two patterns for renaming signals in the Verilog module. The first pattern replaces all occurrences of `old_name` with `new_name`, while the second pattern replaces all occurrences of `another_old_name` with `new_name2`.

### Main Transformation Function

The main transformation function is responsible for running the rename transformation on a Verilog module. It takes two parameters: `old_name` and `new_name`, which are used to perform the text transformation on the signals in the module. The function first parses the Verilog module using the PyVerilog parser, then creates an instance of the `RenameVisitor` class with the old and new signal names as parameters. It then invokes the `visit()` method on the visitor object to traverse all elements in the module and perform the rename transformation.

### Command-Line Interface

The command-line interface allows users to run the rename transformation from a terminal or command prompt. The function first parses the input arguments using the `argparse` library, then invokes the main transformation function with the old and new signal names as parameters. The function also provides error handling and validation to ensure that the input arguments are valid Verilog module files and that the old signal name is present in the module before performing the rename transformation.

### Comprehensive Docstrings

The `RenameVisitor` class and main transformation function are documented using comprehensive docstrings that provide detailed information about each method and parameter. This documentation helps developers understand the functionality of the code and use it more effectively.
