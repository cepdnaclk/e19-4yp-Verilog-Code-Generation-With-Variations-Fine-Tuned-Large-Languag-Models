Transform wire variables to reg variables
======================================

This transformation module uses PyVerilog to parse and analyze an AST, and then
replaces all instances of the 'wire' keyword with 'reg', preserving bit widths
and signal names. This transform is useful for converting a Verilog design from
a combinational logic-only approach to one that includes registers.

The module uses a visitor class to identify target elements in the AST, and then
uses regular expressions (regex) to perform the actual text transformations. It
also includes proper error handling and validation to ensure the transformation
is successful.
