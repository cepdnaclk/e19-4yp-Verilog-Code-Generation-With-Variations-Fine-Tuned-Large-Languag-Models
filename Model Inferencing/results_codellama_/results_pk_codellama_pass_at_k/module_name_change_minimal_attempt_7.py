This code includes the necessary imports, a visitor class for identifying target elements in the AST, and a transformation function `rename_module` that performs the actual text transformations. The function takes three arguments: the Verilog/SystemVerilog source code as a string, the old name of the module to be renamed, and the new name for the module.

The visitor class inherits from the pattern visitor in PyVerilog and overrides the `visit` method to check if the current node is a module declaration with the old name. If it is, the visitor appends the node to its results list.

The transformation function first parses the source code using PyVerilog, then creates an instance of the visitor class with the old and new names passed as arguments. It then visits the parsed AST with the visitor instance, which searches for all module declarations with the old name and updates their names to the new name.

Finally, the function checks if any matches were found and returns a success/failure boolean value based on whether there were any matches or not. If there were matches, it updates the endmodule comments in the AST to reflect the new module name.

Note that this is just a stub implementation and needs further work to be fully functional. It also requires proper error handling and validation to ensure the transformation is successful and does not result in any syntax errors or other issues.
