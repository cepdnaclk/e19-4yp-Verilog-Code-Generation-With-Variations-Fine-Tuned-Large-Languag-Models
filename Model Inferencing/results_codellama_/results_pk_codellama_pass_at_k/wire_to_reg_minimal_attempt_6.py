The `WireToRegVisitor` class inherits from the `xform.visitors.PatternMatchingVisitor`, which is a built-in class that provides basic functionality for visiting nodes in an AST and applying transformations. This visitor will be used to identify wire declarations and replace them with reg declarations.

The `__init__` method takes two arguments: the file name of the input Verilog file, and an optional output file name. The `visit` method is where we perform the transformation on each node in the AST. In this case, we only care about wire declarations, so we check if the current node is an instance of `WireDeclaration`. If it is, we use regular expressions to replace the "wire" keyword with "reg", and then parse the resulting string back into an AST using `vparser.parse_str()`. This will create a new node that represents the reg declaration.

We return this new node instead of the original wire declaration, which allows us to modify the AST in place. If the current node is not a wire declaration, we simply return it unmodified.

The `main` function takes care of running the transformation on the input file and writing the output to a file if needed. It also includes some basic error handling and validation to ensure that the transformation runs correctly.

Here is an example command-line usage:
```bash
python transform_wire_to_reg.py --input my_design.v --output reg_my_design.v
```
This will take the input file `my_design.v`, apply the wire-to-reg transformation, and write the output to a new file called `reg_my_design.v`. The `--output` option is optional, if not specified the transformed code will be printed to stdout.
