  Sure! Here's an example of a transformation module for the xform framework that performs the task of transforming wire variables to reg variables:
```python
import pyverilog as v
import re
from xforms import Transformation, Visitor

class WireToReg(Transformation):
    """
    Transformation that converts wire declarations to reg declarations.

    Requirements:
        - Find all wire declarations in the Verilog file
        - Replace 'wire' keyword with 'reg' keyword
        - Preserve bit widths and signal names
        - Handle both single and multiple wire declarations
    """
    def __init__(self):
        self.visitor = WireToRegVisitor()

    def transform(self, filename: str) -> bool:
        """
        Perform the transformation on the given file.

        :param filename: The name of the file to be transformed.
        :return: True if the transformation was successful, False otherwise.
        """
        try:
            # Parse and analyze the AST
            ast = v.parse_file(filename)
            self.visitor.visit(ast)

            # Perform regex transformations on the file content
            with open(filename, "r") as f:
                content = f.read()
            modified_content = re.sub(self.visitor.pattern, self.visitor.replacement, content)

            # Write the transformed output to a new file
            with open(filename + ".mod", "w") as f:
                f.write(modified_content)

            return True
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error occurred during transformation: {e}")
            return False

class WireToRegVisitor(Visitor):
    """
    Visitor class for the wire to reg transformation.
    """
    def __init__(self):
        self.pattern = re.compile("\\bwire\\s+([^;]+);")
        self.replacement = "reg \\1;"

    def visit(self, node: v.Node):
        """
        Visit the given node and perform any necessary transformations.

        :param node: The node to be visited.
        :return: None.
        """
        if isinstance(node, v.Decl):
            # Check for target declarations
            for item in node.list:
                if hasattr(item, "name") and item.name == self.visitor.signal_name:
                    self.signal_found = True
                    self.changes_made.append(f"Found {self.signal_name}")
```
This transformation module uses the `pyverilog` library to parse and analyze the AST, and it also uses the `re` module for regular expression matching and replacement. It defines a `WireToReg` class that inherits from the `Transformation` class, which is responsible for performing the actual transformation on the given file. The `transform()` method of this class takes in a filename and returns a boolean indicating whether the transformation was successful or not.

The `WireToRegVisitor` class is also defined as a visitor class that inherits from the `Visitor` class, which is responsible for visiting the nodes of the AST and performing any necessary transformations. The `visit()` method of this class takes in a node and performs any necessary transformations on it based on the type of the node. In this case, we are only interested in visiting `Decl` nodes, which correspond to wire declarations in the Verilog file.

The `pattern` attribute of the `WireToRegVisitor` class is a regular expression that matches the syntax of a wire declaration in Verilog, and the `replacement` attribute is a string that represents the replacement text for the matched pattern. The `visit()` method of this class performs the actual transformation by replacing all instances of the `wire` keyword with `reg` in the file content, while preserving the bit widths and signal names.

The `WireToReg` transformation can be used as follows:
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    filename = "example.v"
    transformation = WireToReg()
    if transformation.transform(filename):
        print("Transformation successful!")
    else:
        print("Error occurred during transformation.")
```
This code creates an instance of the `WireToReg` class and calls its `transform()` method with the name of the file to be transformed as an argument. If the transformation is successful, it prints a message indicating that the transformation was successful. Otherwise, it prints a message indicating that an error occurred during the transformation.
