This task requires some knowledge of Verilog and Python programming, as well as familiarity with the PyVerilog library for parsing and analyzing Verilog code. Additionally, understanding of mixed multi-dimensional arrays (MDA) is necessary to perform the transformation correctly.

Here's an example of how you could implement this transformation module:
```python
import re
from pyverilog import vparse
from pyverilog.vparser import nodes
from xform import Visitor, Transformer

class MDACombiner(Visitor):
    """A visitor class for combining different MDA types"""
    
    def __init__(self, filename):
        self.filename = filename
        self.mda_types = []
        self.output_file = open(f'{filename}_combined.v', 'w')
        
    def visit_array_type(self, node):
        """Visit an array type node and add it to the list of MDA types"""
        if isinstance(node, nodes.ArrayType):
            self.mda_types.append(node)
    
    def combine_mdas(self):
        """Combine the different MDA types into a single file"""
        for mda in self.mda_types:
            self.output_file.write(f'{mda.type} {mda.name};\n')
    
    def transform(self):
        """Perform the transformation on the AST"""
        tree = vparse.parse_file(self.filename)
        self.visit(tree)
        self.combine_mdas()
        self.output_file.close()
```
The `MDACombiner` class inherits from the `Visitor` class, which provides a standard way of traversing and modifying an AST in PyVerilog. The `__init__` method takes the name of the input file as an argument and initializes the list of MDA types to be combined. The `visit_array_type` method visits each array type node in the AST and adds it to the list of MDA types if it is an instance of a `nodes.ArrayType`. Finally, the `combine_mdas` method combines all the different MDA types into a single file using the `output_file` attribute.

To use this transformation module with the xform framework, you would need to create a subclass of the `Transformer` class and implement the `transform` method as follows:
```python
from xform import Transformer
import MDACombiner

class CombineMDAs(Transformer):
    """A transformer that combines different MDA types"""
    
    def transform(self, filename):
        """Perform the transformation on the input file"""
        combiner = MDACombiner(filename)
        combiner.transform()
```
The `CombineMDAs` class inherits from the `Transformer` class and provides a simple implementation of the `transform` method that creates an instance of the `MDACombiner` class and calls its `transform` method to perform the transformation on the input file.

To use this transformer with the xform framework, you would need to create a command-line interface using the `argparse` module as follows:
```python
import argparse

if __name__ == '__main__':
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Combine different MDA types')
    parser.add_argument('input', help='Input file')
    args = parser.parse_args()
    
    combiner = CombineMDAs()
    combiner.transform(args.input)
```
This code creates a command-line interface that takes an input file as an argument and calls the `transform` method of the `CombineMDAs` transformer with it.
