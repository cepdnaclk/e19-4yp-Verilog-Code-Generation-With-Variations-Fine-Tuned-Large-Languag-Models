To convert fixed arrays to queue-based multi-dimensional arrays, we can use a combination of PyVerilog and regular expressions. Here's an example transformation module that follows the pattern you specified:
```python
import pyverilog as v
import re
from xform import XForm

class FixedArrayToQueue(XForm):
    """Converts fixed arrays to queue-based multi-dimensional arrays."""

    def __init__(self, args):
        super().__init__(args)
        self.pattern = r"(\w+)\[(\d+):(\d+)]\s*;?"
        self.replacement = r"\1[$2:$3] $4;"

    def visit(self, node):
        if isinstance(node, v.Decl):
            for item in node.list:
                if isinstance(item, v.Net) and item.type == "fixed":
                    self.transform_fixed_array(item)

    def transform_fixed_array(self, fixed_array):
        """Converts a fixed array to a queue-based multi-dimensional array."""
        name = fixed_array.name
        width = fixed_array.width
        dimensions = len(fixed_array.dimensions)

        if dimensions == 1:
            # Unbounded queue
            queue_type = "queue"
            bound = None
        else:
            # Bounded queue
            queue_type = "queue<$>:" + str(width) + ";"
            bound = fixed_array.dimensions[0] - 1

        new_name = re.sub(self.pattern, self.replacement, name, 1)
        new_decl = v.NetDecl(new_name, queue_type)
        new_decl.width = width
        new_decl.dimensions = [bound]
        return new_decl
```
This transformation module inherits from the `XForm` class and overrides the `visit()` method to identify target elements. When a fixed array is found, it calls the `transform_fixed_array()` method to convert it to a queue-based multi-dimensional array. The method replaces the original name with a new one that includes the `$` or `:$bound` dimensions, depending on whether the array has one or multiple dimensions.

To use this transformation module, you can follow these steps:

1. Install PyVerilog and the xform framework using pip:
```bash
pip install pyverilog xform
```
2. Create a new file called `fixed_array_to_queue.py` with the above code.
3. Add the following line to your `xform.ini` file:
```ini
[transforms]
fixed_array_to_queue = fixed_array_to_queue:FixedArrayToQueue
```
4. Run the transformation using the `xform` command-line tool:
```bash
xform -c fixed_array_to_queue <input_file> <output_file>
```
The input file will be transformed and saved to the output file. The `xform` tool will also display a summary of the transformation results, including any errors or warnings that occurred during the transformation process.
