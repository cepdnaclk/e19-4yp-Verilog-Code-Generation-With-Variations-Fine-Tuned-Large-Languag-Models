Here's an example of a Python module for changing the bit width of multiple signals at once using the xform framework:
```python
import pyverilog as v
import re
from xform import XForm

class WidthChanger(XForm):
    """A transformer to change the width of multiple signals at once."""

    def __init__(self, signal_names, new_width):
        self.signal_names = signal_names
        self.new_width = new_width

    def visit(self, node):
        """Visit each node in the AST and update the bit width of the target signals."""
        if isinstance(node, v.Decl):
            # Check if the current declaration matches any of the target signal names
            for name in self.signal_names:
                if node.name == name:
                    # Update the bit width specification
                    node.width = f"{self.new_width}'b0"
                    break
        return node
```
The `WidthChanger` class inherits from the `XForm` class and implements a custom visit method that checks each declaration in the AST for matching target signal names. If a match is found, the bit width of the corresponding declaration is updated to the new specified width.

To use this transformer with the xform framework, you can create an instance of `WidthChanger` and pass it as an argument to the `transform()` method:
```python
from xform import transform

# Create a list of target signal names and their new widths
signal_names = ["signal1", "signal2"]
new_width = 32

# Instantiate the WidthChanger transformer
changer = WidthChanger(signal_names, new_width)

# Transform the input file using the WidthChanger instance
transform("input.v", changer)
```
This will apply the transformation to the input file and write the modified content to a new output file. The `transform()` method will call the `visit()` method of the `WidthChanger` instance for each node in the AST, which will update the bit width of the target signals as needed.
