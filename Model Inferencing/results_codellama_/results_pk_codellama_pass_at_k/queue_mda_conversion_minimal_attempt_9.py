This code uses the PyVerilog library to parse and analyze the AST of the input Verilog file, and then applies the `FixedArrayToQueueTransformer` class to convert all instances of the target element (`FixedArray`) into queue-based multi-dimensional arrays. The transformation is performed using a visitor pattern, where the `visit_Module` method visits each instance of the target element in the AST and calls the `transform_fixed_array` method on it. The `transform_fixed_array` method parses the dimensions from the target element using a regular expression, determines if the queue is bounded or unbounded based on the dimension, and replaces the old declaration with a new queue declaration.

The transformation is also validated to ensure that the input Verilog file contains only fixed arrays and that the queue is not multi-dimensional. The resulting transformed Verilog is written to a file named "transformed_verilog.v".

Note that this code assumes that the target element is of type `FixedArray`, and that the dimensions are specified using square brackets (`[` and `]`). If the input Verilog file uses different syntax for fixed arrays or has other elements that should not be transformed, additional validation and filtering may be needed.
