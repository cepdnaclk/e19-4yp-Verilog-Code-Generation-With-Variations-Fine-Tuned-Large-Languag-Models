Here's an example of a Verilog signal renamer using the xform framework:
```python
import pyverilog as v
import re
from typing import List, Union

class SignalRenamer(v.Pattern):
    def __init__(self, old_name: str, new_name: str) -> None:
        self.old_name = old_name
        self.new_name = new_name

    def visit(self, node: v.Node) -> Union[bool, List[v.Node]]:
        if isinstance(node, v.Decl):
            for item in node.list:
                if hasattr(item, "name") and item.name == self.old_name:
                    item.name = self.new_name
                    return True
        elif isinstance(node, v.Assign) or isinstance(node, v.Sel):
            for child in node.children():
                if isinstance(child, v.NameRef) and child.name == self.old_name:
                    child.name = self.new_name
                    return True
        elif isinstance(node, v.Module):
            for child in node.children():
                result = self.visit(child)
                if result:
                    return result
        return False

def rename_signals(input_file: str, output_file: str, old_name: str, new_name: str):
    # Parse the input Verilog file using PyVerilog.
    ast, directives = v.parse_file(input_file)
    
    # Create a visitor object to identify target elements in the AST.
    visitor = SignalRenamer(old_name, new_name)
    
    # Apply the visitor to the AST.
    result = visitor.visit(ast)
    
    # If the transformation was successful, write the modified AST back to a file.
    if result:
        with open(output_file, "w") as f:
            f.write(v.pprint(ast))
        return True
    else:
        return False
```
This code defines a `SignalRenamer` class that inherits from `Pattern`, which is a built-in visitor in the xform framework. The `visit()` method of this class checks if the current node is a `Decl`, `Assign`, or `Sel` statement, and if it has a child node with a name attribute matching the old signal name. If so, it replaces the name attribute with the new signal name and returns `True`.

The `rename_signals()` function takes an input Verilog file path, an output file path, an old signal name, and a new signal name as arguments. It parses the input file using PyVerilog, creates a `SignalRenamer` visitor object with the old and new signal names, applies the visitor to the AST, and writes the modified AST back to the output file if the transformation was successful.

To use this code, you can run it from the command line as follows:
```bash
$ python rename_signals.py input.v output.v old_signal new_signal
```
This will parse `input.v`, apply the signal renaming transformation, and write the modified AST back to `output.v`.
