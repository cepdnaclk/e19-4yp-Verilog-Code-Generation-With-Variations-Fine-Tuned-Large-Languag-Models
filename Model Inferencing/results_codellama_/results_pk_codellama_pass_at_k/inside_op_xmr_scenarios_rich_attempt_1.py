Here's a possible implementation of the transformation module for creating test cases for inside operator with cross-module references:
```python
import pyverilog as pv
import re
from typing import List

class XMRTestCaseVisitor(pv.ast.NodeVisitor):
    def __init__(self, signal_name: str):
        self.signal_name = signal_name
        self.changes_made = []
        self.signal_found = False

    def visit(self, node: pv.ast.Node):
        if isinstance(node, pv.ast.Decl):
            # Check for target declarations
            for item in node.list:
                if hasattr(item, "name") and item.name == self.signal_name:
                    self.signal_found = True
                    self.changes_made.append(f"Found {self.signal_name}")
        # Visit children
        for c in node.children():
            self.visit(c)

def transform_xmr_testcases(input_file: str, output_file: str, signal_name: str):
    # Parse AST
    ast, directives = pv.parse([input_file])

    # Apply visitor
    visitor = XMRTestCaseVisitor(signal_name)
    visitor.visit(ast)

    if not visitor.signal_found:
        raise Exception(f"Signal {signal_name} not found in input file")

    # Perform regex transformations
    with open(input_file, "r") as f:
        content = f.read()

    # Replace inside operator with cross-module references with appropriate test cases
    pattern = re.compile(r"([\w.]+\.)*(\w+)\s*=\s*(\w+)\s*\.\s*(\w+);")
    replacement = r"\1$TESTBENCH\s*$TEST_CASES\s*= {{\n\t{0}\n}};\n"
    modified_content = re.sub(pattern, replacement, content)

    # Write output
    with open(output_file, "w") as f:
        f.write(modified_content)

    return True
```
This module defines a `XMRTestCaseVisitor` class that inherits from the `pyverilog.ast.NodeVisitor` class and has a `__init__` method to initialize the visitor with the signal name, a `visit` method to visit nodes in the AST, and a `changes_made` attribute to keep track of changes made during the transformation.

The `transform_xmr_testcases` function takes three arguments: the input file path, the output file path, and the signal name. It first parses the input file using `pyverilog.parse()` and then applies the visitor to identify target elements that match the signal name. If no target element is found, an exception is raised.

Next, the function performs regex transformations on the content of the input file to replace inside operator with cross-module references with appropriate test cases. The `re` module is used for regular expression matching and replacement.

Finally, the modified content is written to the output file using the `open()` function and the `write()` method. The function returns `True` if the transformation was successful, or raises an exception if there were any errors.

To use this transformation module with the existing xform framework patterns, you can add it as a new file in the `xforms/` directory of your project. Then, you can run the transformation using the command-line interface provided by the xform framework. For example:
```bash
$ cd path/to/your/project
$ xform transform_xmr_testcases input_file output_file --signal_name my_signal
```
This will apply the `transform_xmr_testcases` function to the `input_file` and write the result to the `output_file`. The `--signal_name` option specifies the signal name that should be used for the transformation.
