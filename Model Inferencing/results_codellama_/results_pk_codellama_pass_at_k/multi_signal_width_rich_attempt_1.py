This task involves creating a transformation module for the xform framework that changes the bit width of multiple signals at once. The requirements include:

* Take a list of signal names and new width
* Find each signal's declaration
* Update the bit width specification
* Handle both packed and unpacked arrays
* Validate that new width is syntactically correct

To generate this module, we can follow these steps:

1. Import necessary libraries:
```python
import pyverilog as pv
import re
import argparse
```
2. Define the visitor class that inherits from the existing xform framework pattern. This class will be used to identify target elements in the AST and perform the actual text transformations.
```python
class MultiWidthVisitor(pv.visitors.Visitor):
    def __init__(self, signal_names, new_widths):
        self.signal_names = signal_names
        self.new_widths = new_widths
        self.changes_made = []
        self.signal_found = False
```
The `__init__` method initializes the visitor with the list of signal names and new widths. The `changes_made` attribute is a list that will store all the changes made by the visitor. The `signal_found` attribute is used to keep track of whether any signals have been found during the visiting process.

3. Define the `visit` method in the visitor class. This method will be called for each node in the AST and will identify target elements.
```python
def visit(self, node):
    if isinstance(node, pv.nodes.Decl):
        # Check if the declaration matches any of the target signals
        for signal_name in self.signal_names:
            if node.type == f"{signal_name}":
                self.signal_found = True
                self.changes_made.append(f"Found {signal_name}")
```
The `visit` method checks if the current node is a declaration. If it is, it will check if the type of the declaration matches any of the target signals in the list. If it does, it will set the `signal_found` attribute to True and append a message indicating that the signal has been found.

4. Define the `transform` function. This function will be used to perform the actual text transformations.
```python
def transform(input_file, output_file):
    # Parse AST
    ast, directives = pv.parse([input_file])
    
    # Apply visitor
    visitor = MultiWidthVisitor(args.signal_names, args.new_widths)
    visitor.visit(ast)
    
    # Perform regex transformations
    with open(input_file, "r") as f:
        content = f.read()
    
    # Apply changes...
    modified_content = re.sub(pattern, replacement, content)
    
    # Write output
    with open(output_file, "w") as f:
        f.write(modified_content)
```
The `transform` function first parses the AST using PyVerilog. It then applies the visitor class to identify target elements in the AST and perform text transformations using regex. Finally, it writes the modified content to an output file.

5. Define a command-line interface for the transformation module. This will allow users to specify the input and output files, as well as the list of signal names and new widths.
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="Change the bit width of multiple signals at once.")
    parser.add_argument("input_file", help="The input file path")
    parser.add_argument("output_file", help="The output file path")
    parser.add_argument("--signal-names", nargs="+", required=True, help="List of signal names to change the width for")
    parser.add_argument("--new-widths", nargs="+", required=True, help="List of new widths for each signal name")
    args = parser.parse_args()
    
    if not transform(args.input_file, args.output_file):
        print("Transformation failed.")
```
The command-line interface will take the input and output file paths as well as the list of signal names and new widths. It will then apply the transformation using the `transform` function and print an error message if the transformation fails.

6. Finally, add proper documentation to the module, including docstrings for all classes and functions.
```python
"""
This module provides a transformation for changing the bit width of multiple signals at once in Verilog/SystemVerilog code.

The transformation takes a list of signal names and new widths as input, and applies these changes to the corresponding declarations in the input file. The output file will contain the modified code with the new widths specified.
"""
```
This documentation provides an overview of the module and its purpose. It also includes information about the inputs and outputs of the transformation function.
