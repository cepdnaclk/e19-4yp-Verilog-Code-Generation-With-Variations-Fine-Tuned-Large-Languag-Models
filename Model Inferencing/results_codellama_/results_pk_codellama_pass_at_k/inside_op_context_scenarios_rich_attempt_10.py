  To generate test cases for the inside operator in different contexts, we can use a visitor class that inherits the pattern from existing xforms. This visitor class will identify target elements and perform text transformations using regular expressions.

Here is an example of how to generate test cases for inside operator usage in if statements:
```python
import pyverilog as v

class IncludeInsideVisitor(v.Pattern):
    def __init__(self, signal_name):
        self.signal_name = signal_name
        self.changes_made = []
        self.signal_found = False

    def visit(self, node):
        if isinstance(node, v.IfStatement):
            for condition in node.conditions:
                if isinstance(condition, v.BinaryExpression):
                    if condition.operator == 'inside':
                        self.signal_found = True
                        self.changes_made.append(f"Found inside operator in {node}")

            # Visit children
            for c in node.children():
                self.visit(c)
```
This visitor class will search for any `inside` operators in if statements and update the `self.signal_found` attribute to True when it finds an instance of inside operator. It also appends a string message to the `self.changes_made` list indicating that an inside operator has been found. The `visit()` method will recursively visit all children of the current node, allowing the visitor to search through all if statements in the AST.

Once we have identified the target elements, we can use regular expressions to perform text transformations on the code. For example, to generate test cases for inside operator usage in case statements, we can use a similar visitor class:
```python
class IncludeInsideVisitor(v.Pattern):
    def __init__(self, signal_name):
        self.signal_name = signal_name
        self.changes_made = []
        self.signal_found = False

    def visit(self, node):
        if isinstance(node, v.CaseStatement):
            for item in node.items:
                if isinstance(item, v.CaseItem):
                    if item.operator == 'inside':
                        self.signal_found = True
                        self.changes_made.append(f"Found inside operator in {node}")

            # Visit children
            for c in node.children():
                self.visit(c)
```
This visitor class will search for any `inside` operators in case statements and update the `self.signal_found` attribute to True when it finds an instance of inside operator. It also appends a string message to the `self.changes_made` list indicating that an inside operator has been found. The `visit()` method will recursively visit all children of the current node, allowing the visitor to search through all case statements in the AST.

Once we have identified the target elements, we can use regular expressions to perform text transformations on the code. For example, to generate test cases for inside operator usage in loops, we can use a similar visitor class:
```python
class IncludeInsideVisitor(v.Pattern):
    def __init__(self, signal_name):
        self.signal_name = signal_name
        self.changes_made = []
        self.signal_found = False

    def visit(self, node):
        if isinstance(node, v.LoopStatement):
            for item in node.items:
                if isinstance(item, v.BinaryExpression):
                    if item.operator == 'inside':
                        self.signal_found = True
                        self.changes_made.append(f"Found inside operator in {node}")

            # Visit children
            for c in node.children():
                self.visit(c)
```
This visitor class will search for any `inside` operators in loops and update the `self.signal_found` attribute to True when it finds an instance of inside operator. It also appends a string message to the `self.changes_made` list indicating that an inside operator has been found. The `visit()` method will recursively visit all children of the current node, allowing the visitor to search through all loops in the AST.

To generate test cases for inside operator usage in continuous assigns, we can use a similar visitor class:
```python
class IncludeInsideVisitor(v.Pattern):
    def __init__(self, signal_name):
        self.signal_name = signal_name
        self.changes_made = []
        self.signal_found = False

    def visit(self, node):
        if isinstance(node, v.ContinuousAssignStatement):
            for item in node.items:
                if isinstance(item, v.BinaryExpression):
                    if item.operator == 'inside':
                        self.signal_found = True
                        self.changes_made.append(f"Found inside operator in {node}")

            # Visit children
            for c in node.children():
                self.visit(c)
```
This visitor class will search for any `inside` operators in continuous assigns and update the `self.signal_found` attribute to True when it finds an instance of inside operator. It also appends a string message to the `self.changes_made` list indicating that an inside operator has been found. The `visit()` method will recursively visit all children of the current node, allowing the visitor to search through all continuous assigns in the AST.

To generate test cases for inside operator usage in procedural and initial/final block contexts, we can use a similar visitor class:
```python
class IncludeInsideVisitor(v.Pattern):
    def __init__(self, signal_name):
        self.signal_name = signal_name
        self.changes_made = []
        self.signal_found = False

    def visit(self, node):
        if isinstance(node, v.ProceduralBlock) or isinstance(node, v.InitialFinalBlock):
            for item in node.items:
                if isinstance(item, v.BinaryExpression):
                    if item.operator == 'inside':
                        self.signal_found = True
                        self.changes_made.append(f"Found inside operator in {node}")

            # Visit children
            for c in node.children():
                self.visit(c)
```
This visitor class will search for any `inside` operators in procedural and initial/final block contexts and update the `self.signal_found` attribute to True when it finds an instance of inside operator. It also appends a string message to the `self.changes_made` list indicating that an inside operator has been found. The `visit()` method will recursively visit all children of the current node, allowing the visitor to search through all procedural and initial/final block contexts in the AST.

To generate test cases for always_comb and case_inside scenarios, we can use a similar visitor class:
```python
class IncludeInsideVisitor(v.Pattern):
    def __init__(self, signal_name):
        self.signal_name = signal_name
        self.changes_made = []
        self.signal_found = False

    def visit(self, node):
        if isinstance(node, v.AlwaysCombBlock) or isinstance(node, v.CaseInsideBlock):
            for item in node.items:
                if isinstance(item, v.BinaryExpression):
                    if item.operator == 'inside':
                        self.signal_found = True
                        self.changes_made.append(f"Found inside operator in {node}")

            # Visit children
            for c in node.children():
                self.visit(c)
```
This visitor class will search for any `inside` operators in always_comb and case_inside blocks and update the `self.signal_found` attribute to True when it finds an instance of inside operator. It also appends a string message to the `self.changes_made` list indicating that an inside operator has been found. The `visit()` method will recursively visit all children of the current node, allowing the visitor to search through all always_comb and case_inside blocks in the AST.

Once we have identified the target elements, we can use regular expressions to perform text transformations on the code. For example, to generate test cases for inside operator usage in if statements, we can use a similar visitor class:
```python
class IncludeInsideVisitor(v.Pattern):
    def __init__(self, signal_name):
        self.signal_name = signal_name
        self.changes_made = []
        self.signal_found = False

    def visit(self, node):
        if isinstance(node, v.IfStatement):
            for condition in node.conditions:
                if isinstance(condition, v.BinaryExpression):
                    if condition.operator == 'inside':
