Here is an example of how you could implement a transformation module for the xform framework to convert arrays to mixed multi-dimensional array types:
```python
import re
from pyverilog import *
from xform.visitors import XFormVisitor

class MDAConversionVisitor(XFormVisitor):
    def __init__(self, signal_name):
        self.signal_name = signal_name
        self.changes_made = []
        self.signal_found = False

    def visit(self, node):
        if isinstance(node, Node):
            # Check for target declarations
            if isinstance(node, Decl):
                for item in node.list:
                    if hasattr(item, "name") and item.name == self.signal_name:
                        self.signal_found = True
                        self.changes_made.append(f"Found {self.signal_name}")

            # Visit children
            for c in node.children():
                self.visit(c)

def transform_mda_conversion(input_file, output_file, signal_name):
    # Parse AST
    ast, directives = parse([input_file])

    # Apply visitor
    visitor = MDAConversionVisitor(signal_name)
    visitor.visit(ast)

    # Perform regex transformations
    with open(input_file, "r") as f:
        content = f.read()

    # Apply changes...
    modified_content = re.sub(pattern, replacement, content)

    # Write output
    with open(output_file, "w") as f:
        f.write(modified_content)

    return True
```
This visitor class inherits from the `XFormVisitor` class and overrides the `visit` method to check for target declarations that match the specified signal name. If a matching declaration is found, the `changes_made` list is updated with a message indicating that the signal was found. The `signal_found` flag is also set to True.

The `transform_mda_conversion` function takes an input file, an output file, and a signal name as arguments, parses the AST using PyVerilog's `parse` function, applies the visitor to the AST, performs regex transformations on the content of the input file using the `re.sub` method, and writes the modified content to the output file. It then returns True if the transformation was successful or False otherwise.

The main interface for this module would be a command-line script that takes three arguments: the input file, the output file, and the signal name. The script would call the `transform_mda_conversion` function with these arguments and display any messages or errors generated during the transformation process.
```bash
$ python mda_converter.py input.v output.v signal_name
```
Here is an example of how you could implement a command-line script to call the `transform_mda_conversion` function:
```python
import sys
from xform import transform_mda_conversion

def main():
    input_file = sys.argv[1]
    output_file = sys.argv[2]
    signal_name = sys.argv[3]

    try:
        result = transform_mda_conversion(input_file, output_file, signal_name)
        if result:
            print("Transformation successful")
        else:
            print("Transformation failed")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error during transformation: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
This script takes three arguments from the command line and passes them to the `transform_mda_conversion` function. If the transformation is successful, it displays a message indicating that the transformation was successful. If an error occurs during the transformation process, it displays an error message.
