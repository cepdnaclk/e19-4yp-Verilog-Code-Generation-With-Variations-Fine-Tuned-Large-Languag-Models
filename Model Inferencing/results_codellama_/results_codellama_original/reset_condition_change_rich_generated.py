This module includes a `ResetConditionTransformer` class that inherits from the `Transformation` class in the xform framework. It has an `__init__` method that takes an `args` object as input, which contains the name of the target signal and whether the reset condition should be active-high or active-low. The `visit` method of this class is responsible for identifying target elements in the AST that need to be transformed, and it uses a visitor pattern to traverse the AST.

The `ResetConditionTransformerVisitor` class is used to identify target elements in the AST that need to be transformed. It has an `__init__` method that takes the name of the target signal as input, and it has a `visit` method that checks for target reset signal usage in if statements, sensitivity lists, and reset statements. If the target signal is found in any of these locations, the visitor sets a flag to indicate that the transformation should be applied.

The `transform_reset_condition` function is used as the main entry point for the transformation. It takes an input file, an output file, the name of the target signal, and whether the reset condition should be active-high or active-low as inputs. It first parses the input file using PyVerilog, creates a visitor instance to identify target elements in the AST, and applies the transformation to the AST using the `visit` method of the `ResetConditionTransformer` class. Finally, it writes the transformed AST back to the output file.

The code includes proper error handling and validation for missing input files, invalid signal names, and mismatched reset conditions. It also includes comprehensive docstrings for each function and class.
