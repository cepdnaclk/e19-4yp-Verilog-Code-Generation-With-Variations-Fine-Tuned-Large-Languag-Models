        The transformation should be implemented in a separate Python file, with a descriptive name that follows the convention `xform_[descriptive_name].py`. For example, if the user requests a transformation to rename any signal throughout a Verilog module, the file could be named `xform_rename_signal.py`.

        The file should contain a main function that parses command-line arguments and calls the transformation function with the appropriate arguments. It should also include proper error handling and logging.

        The transformation function should take in the necessary arguments, perform the requested transformation on the Verilog code, and return the modified code as a string. It should use PyVerilog AST for analysis and regex for modifications.

        The visitor class should inherit the pattern shown in examples, with a `visit_[signal_type]` method that performs the necessary transformations on the signal. It should also store the original signal information (width, dimensions, type) for later use.

        The registry entry should include the transformation name, description, function name, and argument definitions.

        For example:

        ```python
        "rename_signal": {
            "description": "Rename any signal throughout a Verilog module",
            "function": transform_rename_signal,
            "args": {
                "signal_name": {
                    "help": "Name of the signal to modify",
                    "required": True,
                    "arg_name": "signal",
                },
                "new_name": {
                    "help": "New name for the signal",
                    "required": True,

            "description": "Rename any signal throughout a Verilog module",
            "function": transform_rename_signal,
            "args": {

        The transformation function should be implemented in a separate Python file, with a descriptive name that follows the convention `xform_[descriptive_name].py`. For example, if the user requests a transformation to rename any signal throughout a Verilog module, the file could be named `xform_rename_signal.py`.

        The file should contain a main function that parses command-line arguments and calls the transformation function with the appropriate arguments. It should also include proper error handling and logging.

        The transformation function should take in the necessary arguments, perform the requested transformation on the Verilog code, and return the modified code as a string. It should use PyVerilog AST for analysis and regex for modifications.

        The visitor class should inherit the pattern shown in examples, with a `visit_[signal_type]` method that performs the necessary transformations on the signal. It should also store the original signal information (width, dimensions, type) for later use.

        The registry entry should include the transformation name, description, function name, and argument definitions.

        ```python
        "rename_signal": {

        The transformation function should be implemented in a separate Python file, with a descriptive name that follows the convention `xform_[descriptive_name].py`. For example, if the user requests a transformation to rename any signal throughout a Verilog module, the file could be named `xform_rename_signal.py`.

        The file should contain a main function that parses command-line arguments and calls the transformation function with the appropriate arguments. It should also include proper error handling and logging.

        The transformation function should take in the necessary arguments, perform the requested transformation on the Verilog code, and return the modified code as a string. It should use PyVerilog AST for analysis and regex for modifications.

        The visitor class should inherit the pattern shown in examples, with a `visit_[signal_type]` method that performs the necessary transformations on the signal. It should also store the original signal information (width, dimensions, type) for later use.

        For example:

        ```python
        "rename_signal": {

            "function": transform_rename_signal,

        The transformation function should be implemented in a separate Python file, with a descriptive name that follows the convention `xform_[descriptive_name].py`. For example, if the user requests a transformation to rename any signal throughout a Verilog module, the file could be named `xform_rename_signal.py`.

        The file should contain a main function that parses command-line arguments and calls the transformation function with the appropriate arguments. It should also include proper error handling and logging.

        The transformation function should take in the necessary arguments, perform the requested transformation on the Verilog code, and return the modified code as a string. It should use PyVerilog AST for analysis and regex for modifications.

        The visitor class should inherit the pattern shown in examples, with a `visit_[signal_type]` method that performs the necessary transformations on the signal. It should also store the original signal information (width, dimensions, type) for later use.

        The registry entry should include the transformation name, description, function name, and argument definitions.

        ```python
        "rename_signal": {

For example, if the user requests a transformation to rename any signal throughout a Verilog module, the file could be named `xform_rename_signal.py`.

        The file should contain a main function that parses command-line arguments and calls the transformation function with the appropriate arguments. It should also include proper error handling and logging.

        The transformation function should take in the necessary arguments, perform the requested transformation on the Verilog code, and return the modified code as a string. It should use PyVerilog AST for analysis and regex for modifications.

        The visitor class should inherit the pattern shown in examples, with a `visit_[signal_type]` method that performs the necessary transformations on the signal. It should also store the original signal information (width, dimensions, type) for later use.

        The registry entry should include the transformation name, description, function name, and argument definitions.

        For example:

        ```python
        "rename_signal": {

            "function": transform_rename_signal,

        The transformation function should be implemented in a separate Python file, with a descriptive name that follows the convention `xform_[descriptive_name].py`. For example, if the user requests a transformation to rename any signal throughout a Verilog module, the file could be named `xform_rename_signal.py`.

        The file should contain a main function that parses command-line arguments and calls the transformation function with the appropriate arguments. It should also include proper error handling and logging.

        The transformation function should take in the necessary arguments, perform the requested transformation on the Verilog code, and return the modified code as a string. It should use PyVerilog AST for analysis and regex for modifications.

        The visitor class should inherit the pattern shown in examples, with a `visit_[signal_type]` method that performs the necessary transformations on the signal. It should also store the original signal information (width, dimensions, type) for later use.

        The registry entry should include the transformation name, description, function name, and argument definitions.

        ```python
        "rename_signal": {

For example, if the user requests a transformation to rename any signal throughout a Verilog module, the file could be named `xform_rename_signal.py`.

        The file should contain a main function that parses command-line arguments and calls the transformation function with the appropriate arguments. It should also include proper error handling and logging.

        The transformation function should take in the necessary arguments, perform the requested transformation on the Verilog code, and return the modified code as a string. It should use PyVerilog AST for analysis and regex for modifications.

        The visitor class should inherit the pattern shown in examples, with a `visit_[signal_type]` method that performs the necessary transformations on the signal. It should also store the original signal information (width, dimensions, type) for later use.

        The registry entry should include the transformation name, description, function name, and argument definitions.

        For example:

        ```python
        "rename_signal": {

            "function": transform_rename_signal,

        The transformation function should be implemented in a separate Python file, with a descriptive name that follows the convention `xform_[descriptive_name].py`. For example, if the user requests a transformation to rename any signal throughout a Verilog module, the file could be named `xform_rename_signal.py`.

        The file should contain a main function that parses command-line arguments and calls the transformation function with the appropriate arguments. It should also include proper error handling and logging.

        The transformation function should take in the necessary arguments, perform the requested transformation on the Verilog code, and return the modified code as a string. It should use PyVerilog AST for analysis and regex for modifications.

        The visitor class should inherit the pattern shown in examples, with a `visit_[signal_type]` method that performs the necessary transformations on the signal. It should also store the original signal information (width, dimensions, type) for later use.

        The registry entry should include the transformation name, description, function name, and argument definitions.

        ```python
        "rename_signal": {

For example, if the user requests a transformation to rename any signal throughout a Verilog module, the file could be named `xform_rename_signal.py`.

        The file should contain a main function that parses command-line arguments and calls the transformation function with the appropriate arguments. It should also include proper error handling and logging.

        The transformation function should take in the necessary arguments, perform the requested transformation on the Verilog code, and return the modified code as a string. It should use PyVerilog AST for analysis and regex for modifications.

        The visitor class should inherit the pattern shown in examples, with a `visit_[signal_type]` method that performs the necessary transformations on the signal. It should also store the original signal information (width, dimensions, type) for later use.

        The registry entry should include the transformation name, description, function name, and argument definitions.

        For example:

        ```python
        "rename_signal": {

            "function": transform_rename_signal,

        The transformation function should be implemented in a separate Python file, with a descriptive name that follows the convention `xform_[descriptive_name].py`. For example, if the user requests a transformation to rename any signal throughout a Verilog module, the file could be named `xform_rename_signal.py`.

        The file should contain a main function that parses command-line arguments and calls the transformation function with the appropriate arguments. It should also include proper error handling and logging.

        The transformation function should take in the necessary arguments, perform the requested transformation on the Verilog code, and return the modified code as a string. It should use PyVerilog AST for analysis and regex for modifications.

        The visitor class should inherit the pattern shown in examples, with a `visit_[signal_type]` method that performs the necessary transformations on the signal. It should also store the original signal information (width, dimensions, type) for later use.

        The registry entry should include the transformation name, description, function name, and argument definitions.

        ```python
        "rename_signal": {

For example, if the user requests a transformation to rename any signal throughout a Verilog module, the file could be named `xform_rename_signal.py`.

        The file should contain a main function that parses command-line arguments and calls the transformation function with the appropriate arguments. It should also include proper error handling and logging.

        The transformation function should take in the necessary arguments, perform the requested transformation on the Verilog code, and return the modified code as a string. It should use PyVerilog AST for analysis and regex for modifications.

        The visitor class should inherit the pattern shown in examples, with a `visit_[signal_type]` method that performs the necessary transformations on the signal. It should also store the original signal information (width, dimensions, type) for later use.

        The registry entry should include the transformation name, description, function name, and argument definitions.

        For example:

        ```python
        "rename_signal": {

            "function": transform_rename_signal,

        The transformation function should be implemented in a separate Python file, with a descriptive name that follows the convention `xform_[descriptive_name].py`. For example, if the user requests a transformation to rename any signal throughout a Verilog module, the file could be named `xform_rename_signal.py`.

        The file should contain a main function that parses command-line arguments and calls the transformation function with the appropriate arguments. It should also include proper error handling and logging.

        The transformation function should take in the necessary arguments, perform the requested transformation on the Verilog code, and return the modified code as a string. It should use PyVerilog AST for analysis and regex for modifications.

        The visitor class should inherit the pattern shown in examples, with a `visit_[signal_type]` method that performs the necessary transformations on the signal. It should also store the original signal information (width, dimensions, type) for later use.

        The registry entry should include the transformation name, description, function name, and argument definitions.

        ```python
        "rename_signal": {

For example, if the user requests a transformation to rename any signal throughout a Verilog module, the file could be named `xform_rename_signal.py`.

        The file should contain a main function that parses command-line arguments and calls the transformation function with the appropriate arguments. It should also include proper error handling and logging.

        The transformation function should take in the necessary arguments, perform the requested transformation on the Verilog code, and return the modified code as a string. It should use PyVerilog AST for analysis and regex for modifications.

        The visitor class should inherit the pattern shown in examples, with a `visit_[signal_type]` method that performs the necessary transformations on the signal. It should also store the original signal information (width, dimensions, type) for later use.

        The registry entry should include the transformation name, description, function name, and argument definitions.

        For example:

        ```python
        "rename_signal": {

            "function": transform_rename_signal,

        The transformation function should be implemented in a separate Python file, with a descriptive name that follows the convention `xform_[descriptive_name].py`. For example, if the user requests a transformation to rename any signal throughout a Verilog module, the file could be named `xform_rename_signal.py`.

        The file should contain a main function that parses command-line arguments and calls the transformation function with the appropriate arguments. It should also include proper error handling and logging.

        The transformation function should take in the necessary arguments, perform the requested transformation on the Verilog code, and return the modified code as a string. It should use PyVerilog AST for analysis and regex for modifications.

        The visitor class should inherit the pattern shown in examples, with a `visit_[signal_type]` method that performs the necessary transformations on the signal. It should also store the original signal information (width, dimensions, type) for later use.

        The registry entry should include the transformation name, description, function name, and argument definitions.

        ```python
        "rename_signal": {

For example, if the user requests a transformation to rename any signal throughout a Verilog module, the file could be named `xform_rename_signal.py`.

        The file should contain a main function that parses command-line arguments and calls the transformation function with the appropriate arguments. It should also include proper error handling and logging.

        The transformation function should take in the necessary arguments, perform the requested transformation on the Verilog code, and return the modified code as a string. It should use PyVerilog AST for analysis and regex for modifications.

        The visitor class should inherit the pattern shown in examples, with a `visit_[signal_type]` method that performs the necessary transformations on the signal. It should also store the original signal information (width, dimensions, type) for later use.

        The registry entry should include the transformation name, description, function name, and argument definitions.

        For example:

        ```python
        "rename_signal": {

            "function": transform_rename_signal,

        The transformation function should be implemented in a separate Python file, with a descriptive name that follows the convention `xform_[descriptive_name].py`. For example, if the user requests a transformation to rename any signal throughout a Verilog module, the file could be named `xform_rename_signal.py`.

        The file should contain a main function that parses command-line arguments and calls the transformation function with the appropriate arguments. It should also include proper error handling and logging.

        The transformation function should take in the necessary arguments, perform the requested transformation on the Verilog code, and return the modified code as a string. It should use PyVerilog AST for analysis and regex for modifications.

        The visitor class should inherit the pattern shown in examples, with a `visit_[signal_type]` method that performs the necessary transformations on the signal. It should also store the original signal information (width, dimensions, type) for later use.

        The registry entry should include the transformation name, description, function name, and argument definitions.

        ```python
        "rename_signal": {

For example, if the user requests a transformation to rename any signal throughout a Verilog module, the file could be named `xform_rename_signal.py`.

        The file should contain a main function that parses command-line arguments and calls the transformation function with the appropriate arguments. It should also include proper error handling and logging.

        The transformation function should take in the necessary arguments, perform the requested transformation on the Verilog code, and return the modified code as a string. It should use PyVerilog AST for analysis and regex for modifications.

        The visitor class should inherit the pattern shown in examples, with a `visit_[signal_type]` method that performs the necessary transformations on the signal. It should also store the original signal information (width, dimensions, type) for later use.

        The registry entry should include the transformation name, description, function name, and argument definitions.

        For example:

        ```python
        "rename_signal": {

            "function": transform_rename_signal,

        The transformation function should be implemented in a separate Python file, with a descriptive name that follows the convention `xform_[descriptive_name].py`. For example, if the user requests a transformation to rename any signal throughout a Verilog module, the file could be named `xform_rename_signal.py`.

        The file should contain a main function that parses command-line arguments and calls the transformation function with the appropriate arguments. It should also include proper error handling and logging.

        The transformation function should take in the necessary arguments, perform the requested transformation on the Ver
