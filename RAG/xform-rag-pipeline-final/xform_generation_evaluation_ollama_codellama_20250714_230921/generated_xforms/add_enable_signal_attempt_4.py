#!/usr/bin/env python3

        Here's an example of a registry entry for a transformation that adds an enable signal to a counter:

        ```python
        "[add_enable]": {
            "description": "Add an enable signal to control a counter",
            "function": transform_add_enable,
            "args": {
                "enable_name": {
                    "help": "Name of the enable signal to add",
                    "required": True,
                    "arg_name": "enable",
                },
                "counter_name": {
                    "help": "Name of the counter to control",
                    "required": True,
                    "arg_name": "counter",
                },
            },
        },
        ```

        This registry entry defines a transformation called `add_enable` that takes two arguments: `enable_name` and `counter_name`. The `description` field provides a brief description of the transformation, while the `function` field specifies the name of the function that implements the transformation. The `args` field contains definitions for each argument required by the transformation.

        To add this transformation to the registry, you can use the following code:

        ```python
        from pyverilog_transforms import registry

        registry["add_enable"] = {
            "description": "Add an enable signal to control a counter",
            "function": transform_add_enable,
            "args": {
                "enable_name": {
                    "help": "Name of the enable signal to add",
                    "required": True,
                    "arg_name": "enable",
                },
                "counter_name": {
                    "help": "Name of the counter to control",
                    "required": True,
                    "arg_name": "counter",
                },
            },
        }
        ```

        This code adds an entry to the `registry` dictionary with the key `"add_enable"`. The value associated with this key is a dictionary that contains information about the transformation. The `description` field provides a brief description of the transformation, while the `function` field specifies the name of the function that implements the transformation. The `args` field contains definitions for each argument required by the transformation.

        Once you have added this entry to the registry, you can use the following command-line interface to apply the transformation:

        ```bash
        $ pyverilog_transforms -t add_enable -i input.v -o output.v --enable=enable_signal --counter=counter_signal
        ```

        This command applies the `add_enable` transformation to the input Verilog file `input.v`, and writes the transformed code to `output.v`. The `--enable` and `--counter` options specify the names of the enable signal and counter signal, respectively.
