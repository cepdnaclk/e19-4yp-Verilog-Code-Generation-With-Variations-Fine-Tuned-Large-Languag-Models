        Here is an example of a registry entry for a transformation:

        ```python
        "[add_enable]": {
            "description": "Add an enable signal to control a counter",
            "function": transform_add_enable,
            "args": {
                "enable_name": {
                    "help": "Name of the enable signal to add",
                    "required": True,
                    "arg_name": "enable",
                },
                "counter_name": {
                    "help": "Name of the counter to control",
                    "required": True,
                    "arg_name": "counter",
                },
            },
        },
        ```

        This registry entry defines a transformation called `add_enable` that takes two arguments: `enable_name` and `counter_name`. The `description` field provides a brief description of the transformation, while the `function` field specifies the name of the function that implements the transformation. The `args` field contains a dictionary of argument definitions, where each key is an argument name and each value is a dictionary with fields for `help`, `required`, and `arg_name`.

        To add this registry entry to the existing registry, you can use the following code:

        ```python
        import sys
        from pyverilog.xform import registry

        def main():
            # Add the transformation to the registry
            registry["add_enable"] = {
                "description": "Add an enable signal to control a counter",
                "function": transform_add_enable,
                "args": {
                    "enable_name": {
                        "help": "Name of the enable signal to add",
                        "required": True,
                        "arg_name": "enable",
                    },
                    "counter_name": {
                        "help": "Name of the counter to control",
                        "required": True,
                        "arg_name": "counter",
                    },
                },
            }

        if __name__ == "__main__":
            main()
        ```

        This code defines a function called `main` that adds the registry entry for the `add_enable` transformation to the existing registry. The `__name__ == "__main__"` check ensures that this code is only executed when the file is run as a script, rather than when it is imported as a module.

        To use this transformation in your Verilog code, you can add the following line to your `Makefile`:

        ```makefile
        XFORM_TARGETS += add_enable
        ```

        This will run the `add_enable` transformation on all Verilog files in your project. You can also specify specific files or directories by adding additional lines to the `XFORM_TARGETS` variable, such as:

        ```makefile
        XFORM_TARGETS += add_enable my_project/my_module.v
        ```

        This will run the `add_enable` transformation only on the `my_module.v` file in your project directory.
